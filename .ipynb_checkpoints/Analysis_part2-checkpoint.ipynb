       "'This gritty, fast-paced, and innovative police drama earned five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay (written by Ernest Tidyman), and Best Actor (Gene Hackman). Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle (Hackman) and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), are New York City police detectives on narcotics detail, trying to track down the source of heroin from Europe into the United States. Suave Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) is the French drug kingpin who provides a large percentage of New York City\\'s dope, and Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) is a hired killer and Charnier\\'s right-hand man. Acting on a hunch, Popeye and Buddy start tailing Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife, Angie (Arlene Faber), who live pretty high for a couple whose corner store brings in about 7,000 dollars a year. It turns out Popeye\\'s suspicions are right -- Sal and Angie are the New York agents for Charnier, who will be smuggling 32 million dollars\\' worth of heroin into the city in a car shipped over from France. The French Connection broke plenty of new ground for screen thrillers; Popeye Doyle was a highly unusual \"hero,\" an often violent, racist, and mean-spirited cop whose dedication to his job fell just short of dangerous obsession. The film\\'s high point, a high-speed car chase with Popeye tailing an elevated train, was one of the most viscerally exciting screen moments of its day and set the stage for dozens of action sequences to follow. And the film\\'s grimy realism (and downbeat ending) was a big change from the buff-and-shine gloss and good-guys-always-win heroics of most police dramas that preceded it. The French Connection was inspired by a true story, and Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, Popeye and Buddy\\'s real life counterparts, both have small roles in the film. A sequel followed four years later.'"

Russell follows The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook with the third entry in his \"reinvention\" trilogy, a film which is getting as much gold and silver on the mantelpiece this award season as his previous two, but less deservedly so.The movie and most of its characters too often feel like caricatures, their energy pilfered from superior movies you\\'ve seen before.As cons within cons press loyalties on every side, the film is less about political corruption than the deep longing of its characters to find a piece of solid ground, something they can stake a life on.It busies itself with a rollicking soundtrack, sexy costumes, and increasingly implausible romantic encounters between the film\\'s principals.American Hustle amuses with irony, music and wit. It tantalizes with danger but doesn\\'t get violent. Its sexiness - there\\'s grinding in washrooms, on tables and laps - is electric and fun. It\\'s enjoyable and fun to watch, but just barely touches the surface of its own narrative.It\\'s a sly film that slips through your fingers, leaving the glitter of great performances, but one you\\'ll be hustling to watch again. American Hustle slides with such grace through its intrigues, slipping in so many diverting props and devices and walk-ons that you may start to feel you\\'re being hustled by the film itself. . .American Hustle has its flaws, major and minor, but it\\'s very entertaining and contains some great performances, especially by the female cast members.One of the many pleasures of David O. Russell\\'s American Hustle, a fizzy late-seventies cocktail of comedy, romance, and caper pic, is that Bale finally seems to be having a ball.American Hustle is about life as a performance, the ways in which we perceive ourselves and wish to be perceived by others.If only this set of memorable characters were serving a story that didn\\'t feel half-rate.A movie as smart as \\'American Hustle\\' knows that those tactile pleasures only matter if they\\'re attached to some kind of emotional resonance.If American Hustle has anything real to say, it\\'s some minor bromide about greed and corruption. Ultimately, like its central characters, it\\'s is all about \\'tude; of that, it\\'s got a ton.There\\'s not a lot of takeaway from American Hustle, but that\\'s Russell\\'s personality-he\\'s got a great appetite for verve and foolhardy spectacle, rather than reverb and real-life substance.Full of agreeable performances and a few \"aha\" moments that most filmmakers would kill for, but it never comes together in any meaningful way.Vaults heedlessly between bedraggled comedy and serious-stakes scenes in which the director shuts off the fun.Pure, raw energy.David O. Russell has made an amazing film here, filled with some of the most complicated, well-developed, and fascinating characters to grace the screen this year.It\\'s confusing in tone, though very funny at times, especially coming from Cooper and Lawrence, but by the end, Russell feels he\\'s warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he\\'s done anything but. An entertaining but bloated, starry, Grand Hotel-sized con artist caper that looks, sounds and feels like Scorsese without a smidgen of the electricity he effortlessly brings to his pictures.The movie\\'s greatest strength [is] Russell\\'s magnanimity toward his characters, an equable, never cloying embrace of their imperfections.David O. Russell has a gift for the farce at work in American institutions, and in American Hustle he\\'s created another instant classic.David O Russell\\'s film fizzes with energy and wit, bowling along with a brio that matches the quick-wit and razzle-dazzle of its con artists.Amy Adams is spectacular, febrile, dramatic, comic, sharp, sarcastic and magnificent to look upon, especially her soaring laughter in an explosive comic-sexual scene set in a nightclub ladies\\' room stall. To call the end result an absolute triumph would undercut more apropos labels; it seeks to be one of the best films of the year, and transcends that goal.Like the Abscam con, the film is a convincing confection, so well played that we don\\'t care if it\\'s the real deal or not.Look, I think this is a fabulous film. One of the films of the year for me.A fun, energetic caper that tries hard to make you love its characters, but mostly fails to succeed..What could have been a trifling little caper movie becomes, in the hands of Russell and his superb cast, a rich, character-driven film of humor, drama and surprising warmth.Russell\\'s world view is essentially optimistic and romanticSpearheaded by enormously charismatic actors and a script\\'s verbal wit that overrides its untidiness.Save your admiration for the performances, especially Lawrence, who is now Hollywood\\'s most important presence in front of the camera.It turns out that comb-overs, cleavage, cocaine and kookiness are an unbeatable combo.\\'American Hustle\\' is smart, sophisticated and slick. Director David O. Russell has been nominated for the Academy Award for both last year\\'s \\'Silver Linings Playbook\\' and \\'The Fighter,\\' and he\\'s bound to earn at least a nod again this year.To understand the breadth of disco-era deception laid out in American Hustle, understand that the most honest character in the movie is a politician. Not entirely honorable but compared with the swindle sharks circling, he\\'s Jimmy Carter on Sundays.Grand Performances move \"HustleFun, charming, but slight - and way too long and flabby in the girth for such slightness.A tour-de-force piece of filmmaking about the art of survival - and a cinematically-glorious throwback to the Gene Hackman era.Are we being played? Oh, yeah. Just because the time and place of a film takes place within personal experience doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not a historical epic.This is one you\\'ll want to hustle to see on the big screen.American Hustle doesn\\'t conform to one genre, though it has elements of farce, screwball, heist thriller and caper comedy. In dressing it up like a Scorsese-style crime movie, Russell brings an unusual weight and tension to [the film].Russell, writer Eric Singer, and the hyperventilating cast keep us guessing well into the second half.Casting Christian Bale as a Bronx Jew makes as much sense as casting Woody Allen as a Baptist minister from Alabama, not that casting Woody Allen in Bale\\'s role would have saved this mess of a film.Though never boring, American Hustle does itself feel a little like a con - a skilled exercise in creative misdirection.Russell opts for chaos over clarity and love over workmore successful than any of the cons on-screen is the con Hustle plays on its audience,Is there a better actress currently working in movies today than Amy Adams?The actors act up a storm and the tacky period detail, from hideous sofas to men in curlers, fills the screen, but in the end it all feels too staged, too played, too self-aware to fully work. A complicated FBI sting operation is combined with not one, but two love triangles in this sharp, witty comedy drama topped by an audacious ending. The writing crackles with authentic-sounding dialog and the acting is superb.The script by Eric Singer and David O. Russell is rife with banalities and ludicrous situations, mostly involving the mafia. American Hustle\" is marginally entertaining, and ultimately not a satisfying movie-going experience. Believe it or not, amidst all of the oversized collars and outlandish suits, [Russell] wrings pathos out of [his characters].American Hustle ultimately establishes itself as yet another disappointment from David O. Russell...An incongruous jumble, American Hustle\\'s supporting cast and Lawrence\\'s stellar turn lingers in the eye, not the movie as a whole. For a film that perhaps attempted to break a mold, it suffers from simply not knowing what it wanted to be.ABSCAM comes alive in this stereotype drenched, pratfall ridden but entertaining story of good people lost in the American promise.If David O. Russell\\'s earlier movies sometimes felt like an attempt to create layered, Kid A-style concept albums, American Hustle feels more like him onstage at the Silverdome, banging out the loudest open chord he can and hip thrusting at the audience.For a good time, come see this adorable, sexy, deviously antic piece of cockeyed comedy. You want nominations?American Hustle isn\\'t a bad film... but it\\'s certainly an overrated one.A story that spins out of control and lacks a comedic focus.A carnival of a film with cons, cleavage and the great Christian Bale.You forget that Russell once made such impenetrable navel-gazing twaddle as I Heart Huckabees, and simply revel in the fact that American Hustle is often deliriously good fun.It sucks you into its alluring story as if you were a mark.Deliriously alive on screen, with an energy that\\'s often electrifying, it\\'s a movie that in its best moments recalls Scorsese\\'s gangster classic GoodFellas, with a bit of Paul Thomas Anderson\\'s Boogie Nights thrown in to sweeten the pot.... pay your money and take the ride,... laugh and ... be strangely moved by the odd-looking creatures Russell has assembled for his latest ensemble play.Fun ride from Russell. If the opening scene of a film marks the first move of a grand seduction, David O. Russell scores a home run in the first five minutes of American Hustle.Beautifully, inventively constructed, and filled with rich performances that are perfectly calibrated to the offbeat tone [director David O.] Russell was going for.The best ensemble performance of the year and it\\'s all true. Sort of. Perhaps most astonishing of all is that in a film filled such terrific performances, the prevailing personality is that of David O. Russell.It is a superbly written movie ... featuring terrific characters who are played by one of the most talented casts of the year.Regardless of its fine cast and stylish execution, the shallow \"American Hustle\" sells sparkle and hustle. American Hustle offers a, crowd-pleasing experience - one with profound social commentary, laugh-out-loud comedy, and even unexpected moments of compassion to boot.The most exciting thing about David O. Russell\\'s operatic-comedy American Hustle is how every piece of it double plays us. The ensemble helps to spotlight virtues in those who are flawed, and flaws in those who are virtuous, earning sympathy where sometimes none is deserved.On paper, American Hustle should be the movie of the year and sweep the Oscars, but its supreme promise fades once the lights go down in the theater. It\\'s good, not great.Despite its drawbacks, \"American Hustle\" does have a rough-edged charm that holds your attention.The best Scorsese film directed by David O. Russell.It\\'s all hip, humorous, sad, edgy and immensely entertaining, this sprawling period parable about a group of greedy people who aren\\'t who they purport themselves to be.If you\\'re looking for a clockwork-perfect crime plot, you won\\'t find it here. But if you want to hang with some wildly unpredictable and complex characters and wonder who will come up on top, \"Hustle\" is a lot of fun.Somewhat in keeping with its narrative\\'s spectacle of deception, the comedown of this sugar rush of a film might not reveal the most nutritious consumption, but sometimes the messiest concoctions have a better taste.Not since Goodfellas has America\\'s dark, criminal underbelly been explored with such verve.American Hustle reminds me of a great Scorsese movie. The performances are wonderful and so is the film, but it is not easily categorised. Thriller? Caper? Comedy? Romance? Period piece? It is all of these and more.Ambitious even as it studies, exploits and explodes ambition, \"American Hustle\" is as good as any American film this year. It\\'s also a lot of fun. Don\\'t miss it.American Hustle is a movie built on that cornerstone of the American Dream, reinvention. If you\\'re not happy with who you are, or who people think you are, then go ahead and become somebody else. Anything to survive - and thrive.Don\\'t get distracted by all the quick talking, double-crosses or backstabbing. Just enjoy some of today\\'s most talented masters of their craft doing what they do best in a film that will leave you feeling anything but ripped off once it\\'s over.So many layers of double-cross, lies, betrayal, grandiosity, and sheer insanity that the audience may feel they are getting lost, but in a way, that is the point. Bursting with humor, great acting and David O. Russell\\'s abundant filmmaking talent, American Hustle is a joy to watch.Every time I want to call American Hustle\\'s bluff, it rises to being more than the sum of some of its parts, thanks to the female performances.This isn\\'t a history lesson. It\\'s pure entertainment, an excuse for good actors to romp through a twisting, well-told tale.The source of this movie\\'s galvanizing intrigue is that the characters remain in play -- they never settle into placeIt\\'s one of the year\\'s cleverest films, and also one of the best.There is fun to be had. Just don\\'t expect something on a level with the director\\'s recent work.It joins the pantheon of great con job movies with The Sting, House of Games and Wild Things.A sloppy, miscast, hammed up, overlong, overloud story that still sends you out of the theater on a cloud of rapture.American Hustle\" may have taken its inspiration from the art of the steal, but it has a heart of pure, if slightly tarnished, gold.Russell\\'s films find their heroes among the men and women who respond with grace and conscience to what the Jennifer Lawrence character calls \\'poisonous choices\\'...American Hustle\" is what might result if a movie snorted cocaine.American Hustle may be the finest example of how well the Russell formula works, surpassing Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, his two most recent Oscar-nominated films.With a solid-gold cast and a sterling script, \"American Hustle\" has a higher return on investment than any other movie in the marketplace.[Russell] seems to be having obscene amounts of fun, which becomes contagious very quickly.American Hustle is a reminder that it\\'s a privilege to see work that\\'s so masterful.Filled with rich characters and sharp dialogue, the movie turns on questions of friendship and fidelity, both personal and political, with a knockout performance by Jennifer Lawrence as the con man\\'s jealous, ball-busting wife. The screenplay is so dense and nuanced, the characters so textured and conflicted, the plot so tight and twisty that American Hustle achieves a dramatic reality of documentary proportions.David O. Russell has created this riveting world full of eccentric, well-rounded characters. American Hustle is a crime drama that is constantly engaging, hilarious, and stimulating. Christian Bale is sleazy perfection. Some critics love to tear down a crowd-pleasing contender. Don\\'t let them sway you. American Hustle is a good-time holiday movie.Brilliantly directed and superbly written, this is a hugely entertaining drama with impeccable production design work, a fabulous soundtrack and note-perfect performances from a terrific ensemble cast.Above everything else, Russell has an unerring talent for drawing out the best from his actors. Everyone here is in top form, though [Bradley] Cooper\\'s near-manic FBI agent dictates some odd acting choices.Though the maneuvering almost descends into tedium at times, Russell has created a dense and operatic portrait in which nothing is as it seems.Many of the plot set-ups get plenty of laughs, but the movie feels like a series of contrivances.To borrow a phrase the film\\'s con artists are prone to saying, American Hustle works from the feet up, and the fun is intoxicating.Betrays a lack of cinematic judgment that\\'s frankly astonishing, from a group of very accomplished filmmakers and performers. It\\'s Scorsese Karaoke. Think \\'Casino\\' meets \\'The Grifters,\\' shot through with a hefty dose of the off-kilter ... and that\\'s \\'American Hustle.\\'Russell\\'s unerring ability to take the careworn components of a story and fashion them into something unique and poignant reaches its peak with an exuberant caper that satisfies across the board - from love story to switch-backing crime yarn.It\\'s an experiment in character exploration. You\\'ll walk away from it with an affirmation that people are complicated bundles of contradictions. Especially these people.Being swindled has never been this much fun.Russell\\'s aping is still a knockout, with enough razzle-dazzle style and propulsive humor to make it one of the most casually fun movies of the year.American Hustle is a very well acted tale of con artists and their volatile relationships.An example of performances transcending the motion picture they are in, \"American Hustle\" excels when observing its human figures in all of their honest and pretend forms.Russell, following last year\\'s sweet \"The Silver Linings Playbook\" with a very different tale of reinvention, has made a glittery disco ball of a movie, with Lawrence as its unexpectedly shining star.American Hustle confidently tackles this concept of transcending reality through deception, showcasing the versatility of its exceptional cast amidst a tale peppered with savage laughs and dark twists.A bizarrely still, tortured caper, the feature offers exceptional performances and a coarse script, yet attention always manages to return to its visual impression, calling up the decade in the strangest ways. American Hustle\" is a good film that could have been great had it not gone into hibernation through its middle portion. However, thanks to one of the year\\'s best ensembles and Russell\\'s keen eye for direction it becomes an enjoyable romp.American Hustle is a big, bold, and brash study of big, bold, and brash characters.Russell has always had a talent for harmonizing tragedy and comedy, seriousness and outlandishness, all within a precise tone that allows for a wide range of emotions and effects. But his hand has never been more sure.Fast and loose but it could be fast and looser. Through voice-over, withheld info, shaggy dog stories and flywheel-spinning actor\\'s exercises, Russell keeps yanking the plot back like a balloon salesman grabbing fleeing merchandise.... [Russell] bullshits his way through the narrative, basically, giving his stellar cast plenty of room to improvise at length but in the end coming off as an indulgent storyteller unable to self-edit.There\\'s a self-aware feel to the period pageantry, the alternatingly seductive and kinetic cinematography, and the actor\\'s showcase this ramshackle contraption has been held together with spit and bailing wire to be.Keeps you guessing throughout, a very well written piece and yet another Oscar contender.Russell\\'s principal obsession is the period and, I\\'m sorry, but someone really should\\'ve taken the filmmaker aside before shooting began and reminded him the decade\\'s been done to death. Maybe Ron Burgundy could\\'ve broken the news.It\\'s hilarious and sad and, especially, entertaining.I wouldn\\'t call American Hustle my kind of movie, but perversely, I have to admit I enjoyed it, primarily because of the twisted logic and wicked cleverness.A profoundly entertaining collection of none-too-bright folks who think they\\'re smarter than everyone else. And it\\'s all set to the best soundtrack of the year.Likeable and engaging despite its overly long running time, sloppy screenplay and rambling structure.The movie is an undeniable good time. But don\\'t expect any of it to hold together.AS with previous films The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, David O Russell can expect to bother the prize-givers this award season with American Hustle.The best time I\\'ve had at the movies all year.The film zigs and zags, chasing after many different characters. And that sprawl, the rogue\\'s gallery of strays, cheaters and deceivers, activates the film rather than deflates it.Jennifer Lawrence is entirely extraordinary, improving on the performance that won her an Oscar for Russell\\'s last film. Long may this collaboration continue.Director and co-writer David O. Russell deserves all the credit in the world for creating a story, characters and environment in which his actors could truly get lost.It\\'s a process, it\\'s a thrill, a way to survive and to trust, to make good even when the choices are bad.A great deal more fun than most Oscar hopefuls allow themselves to be. Think Goodfellas, but with bad comb-overs. And perms. And yards of corduroy and crushed velour. American Hustle is a relative of Goodfellas and Boogie Nights, although never quite as transcendently magical as those two films. Which just means it isn\\'t one of the greatest movies ever made, so don\\'t hold that against it.You may not trust the facts in American Hustle but you can rely on it as one of this year\\'s most aggressively entertaining films.An extremely entertaining, brilliantly acted, highly diverting film which - like all hustles - delivers less than it promises. Still, it\\'s worth being taken for the ride.One of the very best films of the year.A well made film that left me emotionally cold.American Hustle is Saturday Night Bluster.American Hustle is an ambitious satire, made by an accomplished filmmaker and loaded with terrific acting talent; but despite appreciating it for what it tried to achieve instead, it\\'s hard not to feel slightly conned.Deliriously entertaining and sexy.Credit the script and the editing as well, but American Hustle is quite simply an actor\\'s movie, and the entire ensemble is just fun to watch.In a year already graced with a glorious over-supply of great films, American Hustle arguably contains the best performance package of the lot.On the plus side of the ledger, Russell enables his cast to inhabit some colorful, downright transformative, characters.It\\'s rarely as playful or funny or loose or hip as it hopes.A slick, funny and hugely entertaining film anchored by a genuine emotional centre.Out-Scorseses Scorsese with its epic ensemble historical crime dramedy bursting with insanely engaging characters who are impossibly real and impossibly ridiculous whose stories you don\\'t ever want to end.David O. Russell picked the right cast, but the wrong genre, for a sincere meditation on insincerity.Even with a freewheeling style, \"Hustle\" is never aimless. All that flash, sass and canny sense for detail hit the jackpot ...The actors give the movie different sorts of mania.It\\'s a messy movie, yes, but that complements the messy personalities at its center.Mesmerizing mature drama with just a bit of sex, violence.American Hustle may be full of people faking, but Russell is the real deal.Loose, wandering, and often monotonous.It\\'s a kaleidoscopic carnival, structured from the viewpoint of each of its main protagonists. The film itself is devised a species of scam, and for a while it\\'s fun to be in on the con. Russell is, in effect, playing us....the emphasis is on comedy and lightness highlighted by award quality performance, especially by Lawrence and Adams, who appears in extremely revealing clothes throughout.An awkward start, especially as it takes a moment to get used to Russell\\'s style and tone, but once \"Hustle\" finds its footing it really takes off and is one of the most intelligent and enjoyable films of the year.Despite all this copycatting, the movie still has an interesting energy.Russell is so enamored with the period pizzazz - the outrageous hairstyles and outfits, the strobe-lit clubs, the yellows and browns - that the movie flatlines.With a tighter plot and more consistent tone, American Hustle could have had a shot at greatness.All in all, \"American Hustle\" is a fun ride - while it lasts.Ridiculously entertaining in all the best ways.An acting masterclass delivered by some of Hollywood\\'s best. Dizzying, outlandishly entertaining ...Isn\\'t it a pleasure to get hustled by such exquisite professionals?... American Hustle is like a passionate, booze-soaked conversation at a party: fun while it last, but foggy the next morning.Immensely entertaining, impeccably structured and featuring excellent performances from its entire cast, American Hustle is one of the year\\'s absolute best films and a serious contender for every major award.High-energy comedy comes naturally to the filmmaker. He exults in free association, emotional riffs, in the craziness that underlies ostensibly rational behavior.With one of the best ensemble casts of any film this year, it\\'s audacious, enthralling and uproarious.This year\\'s ARGO in that it\\'s a smart, adult caper that has the potential to both score major awards and major box office. It\\'s a blast from start to finish. It truly is a good movie that will get the audience sucked in; however the tone that David O. Russell has been able to inject into his films takes surprisingly long to surface here.Russell has created another film that is a joy to watch from beginning to end; he uses his considerable talent stockpile in front of the camera to weave a story that is funny, dramatic, and laughs at itself all at once. A dark comedy with a dash of crime drama and a crime drama with a healthy sense of humor, American Hustle defies easy categorization as it offers up a twisty plot and some of the year\\'s best performances.For some, the silver linings in Russell\\'s movies represent a failure to embrace darkness. I see them as a humanist\\'s act of resistance. That\\'s why American Hustle ranks with the year\\'s best movies. It gets under your skin.The film has a sort of disciplined looseness to it, tightly paced and shrewdly constructed but also ridiculously entertaining.It\\'s a film of jaw-dropping virtuosity and pleasure, one that leaves you revved, enthralled, tickled, moved, and amazed.American Hustle\" giddily embraces the excesses of its era, from spandex to \\'staches, though it\\'s a farce that speaks as well to this tarnished age....so eager to sell the sizzle that the lack of a steak barely registers.It\\'s a high-spirited lark that works thanks to Russell\\'s dazzling direction, delicious period details and a parade of stellar performances.With a crackling script and masterful direction, Russell has made a fiction that is stranger -- and way more fun -- than the truth. He has the help of a dream cast of actors, all at the top of their games.This is a film to be enjoyed for its eccentric performances; a hyper, engrossing dramedy of relationships.In a dazzling movie about the art of the con, Jennifer Lawrence -- playing a feisty and frustrated New York housewife -- manages to steal all her scenes. David O. Russell deploys his deranged genius to explore the real events behind Abscam, cleverly focussing on the inter-relationships rather than the details of the elaborate sting operation.American Hustle turns out to be a freewheeling party of a movie, one that never stops adding complications and wrinkles and hungry new players to the mix.[David O.] Russell is not Scorsese. He doesn\\'t do \\'cool shots\\' with the camera. His passion is for observing actors, giving them the space to create chaos that his frames struggle to contain.Just because David O. Russell\\'s take on ABSCAM isn\\'t what I\\'d hoped it would be doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t still a damn entertaining movie. In fact, I had a blast watching it.Director David O. Russell delivers once again with this wonderfully performed, wildly entertaining dissection of The American Dream.David O. Russell enters Marty Scorsese territory with the sagacious wit of Mark Twain and satire and slapstick worthy of Preston SturgesAmerican Hustle is an extremely entertaining ride through the human condition, with characters just short of ridiculous. The beautiful thing is that Russell does this without becoming mean.American Hustle offers so many easy pleasures that people may not think of it as a work of art, but it is. In the world that Russell has created, if you don\\'t come to play you\\'re not fully alive.Another vibrant film directed by David O. Russell that is bursting with colorful characters, funny scenes, and standout performances. It is a wildly entertaining piece of work that features one of the best ensembles of the year. Never quite lets you forget you\\'re watching bravura acting but that acting is deliriously funny. The film is just enough over the top so the artifice becomes part of the joke.Does American Hustle have heart -- does it have importance? Such naive questions: It has Jennifer Lawrence blowing up a microwave.Lying is an ugly, grubby business, which is why hair maintenance amongst con artists is so important.A velvet drenched romp through the world of a con man but most of the time it\\'s like watching a Las Vegas Martin Scorsese tribute showIt\\'s a little bit \"Boogie Nights,\" a little bit \"Argo,\" a little bit \"GoodFellas.\" It\\'s a breath mint, it\\'s a chewing gum, it\\'s a laxative, it\\'s a hockey puck.American Hustle contains fireworks aplenty-dramatic outbursts of bravura filmmaking, sly acting choices, a scene that makes Robert De Niro scary again-but also a few too many familiar moments.David O. Russell has crafted an unexpectedly zany, tantalizing crowd-pleaser that\\'s relentlessly entertaining.With a stacked cast, and sharp scripting and direction from Russell, American Hustle makes for a highly entertaining guide on how to fake it in AmericaThis film has actual heart and soul. That\\'s because Russell looks at the whys of these people\\'s lives in ways that make this movie jump to life at unexpected moments.The film may lack grit but the stellar cast adds to its allure, helping to round out this dynamic account where reinvention offers the means to endure.A feast of a movie-an uncorked entertainment in which every scene trembles with energy and actorly invention.A deliciously entertaining movie about the perfect con, corruption and how to survive on thin ice, American Hustle starts its hustling right from the get-go with its edgy script, winning cast and fab jazzy scoreFunny, sexy and stylish as hell, Russell\\'s Scorsese homage lacks the zip of Marty\\'s greatest work, but makes up for it with hilarious dialogue and a killer ensemble on top form.Martin Scorsese has his Goodfellas. David O. Russell answers with his Mediocre-fellas. While Russell\\'s film succeeds on the strength of its casting and characters, it\\'s dragged down by a murky and poorly-paced narrative.You feel that one false move from anyone could bring the whole thing crashing down to earth: fortunately, Russell\\'s cast seem to have an innate sense of exactly how far they can push it....doesn\\'t amount to much, but wow does it have some electric performances.A zany comedy that makes FBI agents look like keystone cops.Russell distils his own toxic kind of nitrous oxide and pipes it into the cinema.Russell and co-writer Eric Singer have used the general details of the events to whip up a truly hilarious look at a bunch of dreamers and con artists all lying each other into a lather, and it\\'s a raucous entertainment.While you have to admire American Hustle for its willingness to work hard and play harder, it\\'s also hard to not notice that all of its frantic efforts don\\'t really go anywhere new.one of those extremely watchable movies that will suck you into a cable tractor beam when you come across it for the next ten yearsIf awards were handed out for the sloppiest movies, \"American Hustle\" would be a dead ringer for just such a booby prize. A brilliant cast shines in David O. Russell\\'s deliriously funny account of the notorious Abscam case.An infectious blast of funky jazz played by a terrific cast and a director at the top of their respective games.Has the kind of throbbing pulse, wicked snap and sheer moviemaking bravado that makes it one of a very few films that can be mentioned in the same breath as Goodfellas.Russell turns the pursuit of the American dream into the ultimate escapism.David O. Russell\\'s American Hustle is at times both deliciously sexy and hilariously unsexy in its attempt to portray the awful, scheming hustlers we all pretend not to be.The movie is a mess, but a glorious, big-hearted, beautifully acted one.Silver Linings Playbook may well be my favourite movie of the year. Go see it. Like, right now.Cooper manages to show that he is still capable of doing more than his traditional throw-away, comedic roles.Although the story sometimes drags and the predictable rom-com ending feels too pat, \"Silver Linings Playbook\" scores some intriguing insights into what mental illnesses we consider socially acceptable.Thanks to some truly terrific acting and amusing subplots with Pat\\'s parents, the story works. Playing outspoken, emotionally damaged young widow Tiffany, Lawrence is a firecracker, a powder keg, a force of nature.Silver Linings Playbook is difficult to like, and too long, with a climactic dance scene that is filmically botched, which is fine with the movie because according to the plot it did not have to be good to succeed.Russell\\'s smart, snappy script is delivered by a top-notch cast, including two thoroughly likeable and well-matched leads.Despite the film\\'s flaws, Russell excels at creating a community of misfits around Pat and Tiffany.Once Silver Linings Playbook gets close to Lawrence, it doesn\\'t have to crowd her again...She holds up her head, breathes hard and glows.Silver Linings Playbook gives us four performers to relish.It\\'s a challenging picture, but it runs the gamut of emotions so well that it\\'s nearly impossible to dislike.Wouldn\\'t it be great if mental illness really was as adorable as it is in the movies?Silver Linings Playbook\" makes comic hay from bipolar illness, early death, sexual adventurism, self-improvement binges, football fanaticism, degenerate gambling and father-son estrangement, as one would expect from latter-day Russell movies.But Silver Linings Playbook never induces a roll of the eyes, even if it never really surprises.In an age when the concept of comedies about possible kinships between characters is dominated by sugary devices and contrivance, here at last is a movie about real situations, real people and the natural experiences that evolve from them.A unique dramedy that stands heads and shoulders above most romantic films.A wild mess, but what a mess it is.It finds the gentle balance between traditional romantic comedy and artistic exploration of the laws of attraction.A romantic comedy for people who don\\'t like what Hollywood has been calling \\'romantic comedies\\' these days. One of the most pleasurably offbeat experiences since the Philadelphia Eagles last enjoyed a winning season. A deft treatment of its delicate subject material and some remarkable performances that give the film both touching, raw, authentic emotion and a certain kinetic humor.Jennifer Lawrence is the only aspect of the film that truly lives up to the trumped-up awards buzz and hype, but being a perfectly enjoyable light comedy with heaps of heart is no small feat in itself.I love the work that deNiro and Lawrence do here, but ultimately all they do is prove the old adage that you can cover up a lot of problems with the script by hiring good actors. Silver Linings Playbook looks like your run-of-the-mill wacky family comedy, but it\\'s an important film and a great one that deserves to sweep the awards it\\'s nominated for.Silver Linings Playbook is defined by the positive decisions that are made in the face of imperfection, desperation, and the desolate wasteland of your world in pieces.Director David O. Russell forms a unique and incredible romance dramedy...There is some charm to the story, but the final act is very neat, predictable, contrived, and not up to originality of the first two. Director David O. Russell is a little too chipper at times - breaking a restraining order is really no joke - but he brings a breeziness to this likeable tale of two misfits trying to make it work. It may be a Hollywood comedy, but it\\'s one that feels beautifully alive.On the surface Silver Linings Playbook is a raucous romantic comedy, but its real interests are superstition and delusion.A volatile mix of familial drama and madcap comedy, infectious optimism and razor-wire wit, it\\'s one of the most purely enjoyable films released in the past twelve months.I suppose the phrase \\'serious romantic comedy\\' sounds like a paradox. But that\\'s exactly what \\'Silver Linings Playbook\\' is: an intelligent, edgy dark comedy with romance at its core. This is a rom-com dressed up as an Oscar-baiting \"dramedy\". It\\'s a good rom-com thanks to it\\'s edge... but occasionally has the bad traits of a bad rom-com.Silver Linings Playbook puts the \"fun\" in \"dysfunction.\" And sure, that sounds glib, but actually, it\\'s a rather extraordinary achievement. Especially when you\\'re skirting on the edges of sanity. A bittersweet pill that\\'s a mixture of an endearing family drama and modern romance that\\'s an absolute delight. tows the line of conventional, feel-good Hollywood rom-com, albeit dressed up in just enough art-house quirk to make it feel like something slightly radicalA reminder that \\'sanity\\' doesn\\'t make your flaws any more orderly.Silver Linings Playbook is a fine, funny film, and one that should charm viewers who haven\\'t been tricked by all those Oscar nominations into anticipating it as some kind of world-changing work of art for the ages.David O. Russell\\'s latest buzz film straddles a fine line between farce and kitchen-sink drama before settling into a groove that gets under one\\'s skin.It starts to fray about halfway through as it shifts into a more conventional mode, taking on the usual trappings of the genre and making its way to a predictable resolutionBoth charming and gritty... Cooper is edgy, while Lawrence is dynamiteIf there\\'s one reason why you should see this film, it\\'s to admire the wonderful performances from Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.Cooper and Lawrence Shine in Linings.Down-to-earth, funnier than you\\'d expect, and sympathetic toward its volatile, damaged characters. Just the sheer number of characters flitting around, each scrambling for plot space, gives an idea of just how frantic this movie can be. But Russell expertly uses all of it for maximum emotional -- and sometimes physical -- impact.Yes, the marketing presents it as a big broad comedy -- and it certainly is -- but it\\'s also a unique and involving tale of two outsiders who together find a way to get on with life after it has dealt them some bad hands.It\\'s tough to go wrong when your movie features two of the hottest stars, but director David O. Russell doesn\\'t stop there.When Lawrence and Cooper are together, their chemistry jumps and sparks and their rat-a-tat psycho-banter aims for Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell territory.A cinematic high-wire act that audaciously blends edgy comedy together with genuinely touching drama into one of the most purely and surprisingly entertaining movies of the year.Director David O. Russell, who adapted the novel, and his cast fill the story with engaging, believable characters.Fine mainstream sitcom material.Writer-director David O. Russell keeps the audience guessing. He takes unexpected twists and turns as if defying you to guess what will come next.Consistently engaging, funny, and touching. This is the kind of picture in which two hours of running time whiz by in a flash.Succeeds less on the merits of aesthetics than its willingness to give in to crowd-pleasing effervescence.A quirky, dramatic and totally entertaining movie that features someof the best acting of the year.Having gone from unknown actress to Oscar nominee to \"The Hunger Games\" in what seemed like a blink of an eye, Lawrence shows herself a master of timing and plays off Cooper brilliantly.It\\'s a rom-com that succeeds in revitalizing that discredited genre where so many others have failed, injecting it with the grit and emotion of realist drama rather than with amped-up whimsy or social satire or montages of people walking on the beach.Silver Linings Playbook tells us that happily-ever-after may depend on finding people who coexist with our lunacy, not ones who can lead us out of it.

The plot is clever and a bit unconventional. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro all turn in wonderful performances in this very funny, very warm comedy.During its rocky road to becoming a fractured love story, Silver Linings Playbook and its great ensemble cast run a funny, conflict-mined, even suspenseful path. It\\'s a total winner.Unlike the usual run-of-the-mill rom-com, this film bristles with life from the central core of the love story, to the quirky band of supporting players who add to the fun.With \"The Silver Linings Playbook,\" Russell picks up the traditional quirky rom-com genre and shakes it around, just to see what happens. Where it\\'s going is fairly predictable; how it gets there isn\\'t. A delightfully dysfunctional romantic comedy that\\'s moving, funny and features just the right amount of crazy love. A tenderhearted tale about two terribly wounded souls who survive by grudgingly leaning on each other\\'s shoulder. Your best bet for a movie that will entertain you, make you laugh and maybe even make you tear-up.Russell handles the shifts in tone extremely effectively, and has sacrificed little of his sardonic edge in crafting something this superficially accessible.Funny without being glib, serious without being pretentious or depressing, this is a mature movie with fully realized characters and fine performances.Cooper gives a fine performance in a difficult role, but the one who really shines is Lawrence. Beautiful and sexy, she should be up for awards for this one. The movie itself is bipolar, full of mounting tension and hilarity like a classic screwball comedy, but it\\'s all just barely skimming above a deep layer of darkness. delivers the kind of sharply timed laughs that Sturges and Wilder would\\'ve appreciatedThere\\'s a lot to like here and with strong performances all-around, a fresh script with characters that sound and act real. Add this film to your essential Oscar viewing game plan.Loaded with pleasant surprises, this adaptation of Matthew Quick\\'s novel combines romantic comedy, dysfunctional family woes and a sense of danger without ever losing its way.One hundred percent predictable, yet strangely kind of fun.It\\'s honest you see; and honestly, as any fule no, is the bedrock of any successful relationship whether it be between two homo fictives or an audience and their movies....recalls the screwball psychiatry of Russell\\'s earlier efforts, only this time the farce has heart.\\'Screwball\\' is a slang term for \\'crazy,\\' and perhaps this is what inspired writer-director David O. Russell to literalize as well as update the screwball comedy genre here...When you make a movie set in Philly, you\\'d better get it right. Knowledgeable Eagles\\' fans may find Russell\\'s sense of history maddening.Writer-director David O. Russell\\'s out-of-control filmmaking style is perfectly suited to a romantic-comedy involving mental illness, and he infuses the film with a sparky unpredictability that\\'s echoed in the perfectly graded performances of the cast.Smart, funny, great performancesIndeed the movie does make you feel quite good about humanity as the final credits roll....ultimately unable to wholeheartedly become the feel-good romantic comedy that Russell has clearly intended...Offers the satisfaction you\\'d expect from a romcom and feel-good sports movie, but Lawrence and Cooper\\'s delicate treatment of their characters makes it far more than a fleeting source of entertainment.Silver Linings Playbook remains a very classy, acceptably funny slice of comic drama. But that eventual cop-out feels deeply unsatisfactory.Easily overcomes its familiar beats, thanks to a real attention to character detail, a nonjudgmental approach to all the flaws plaguing the players, and a cast that works beautifully together.Laugh out loud funny at times and gut wrenching at others with just the right amount of bleak material to be intriguing and not overly depressing, Silver Linings Playbook is one of the most genuine and human films of the year.[H]alf thrilling, as it always is when a movie does well something The Movies don\\'t typically try to do at all, and half uncomfortable, because it\\'s not always easy to watch.Love is not perfect, but it beats the next best thingThis is a date movie that caters to the needs of both men and women: American football and comedy, ballroom dancing and romance. Silver Linings Playbook covers all those bases -- and rises above them too.Seeing it a second time has made me love it even more, not always the case.A charming, touching and funny film, which sits near the top end of the rom-com world.There are times when it does something new with the genre - and it does make you care about the protagonists.A feelgood film that doesn\\'t avoid life\\'s harsh realities, Silver Linings Playbook is heartwarming winter treat.A funny, believable film about the ability of even the damaged and imperfect to earn a little happiness.... a terrific ensemble comedy about mental illness that achieves just the right balance of humor and poignancy without trivializing or exploiting the affliction at its center.If The Fighter, was Russell\\'s take on a sports movie, then Silver Linings Playbook is his version of a romantic comedy, and a delightfully twisted one at that.Silver Linings Playbook\" is a Hollywood romantic comedy made to mask the horrific downside of mental illness while still giving the audience a little sense of superiority as they walk out of the cinema.Silver Linings Playbook is all things to all moviegoers. Please join the queues circling the blocks.It should be unwatchable. But in the sure hands of America\\'s most effervescent humanist director, David O. Russell, it\\'s unmissable.A man\\'s bi-polar disorder is supposed to give license to implausible and contrived histrionics. Silver Linings Playbook is always interesting and full of humanity in all its shades. It has plenty of black humour and it\\'s superbly acted.Might at first look like proper cinema red in tooth and claw, but underneath it\\'s a bundle of matted fleece and bleating.A hugely enjoyable, warm-hearted romantic comedy-drama with a refreshing honesty towards its subject matter and a pair of terrific performances from Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.This is a date movie that doesn\\'t offer the sophistication it thinks it does, but is as enjoyable and good-natured as the genre requires.Certain movies are sprinkled with pixie dust, an indescribable concoction that infuses scenes with irresistible magic; Silver Linings Playbook is practically hand-rolled and deep-fried in the stuff.

The banter is spikier, wacky sidekicks have issues, too, and Pat and Tiffany\\'s obstacles aren\\'t fluff. The screws are tighter, and the movie is a ball.An edgy romantic dramedy that suits our anxious times.Lawrence\\'s bold performance and her fearlessly sexual character are more than Russell knows how to harness.An intelligent and well-crafted film that seeks to inspire audiences by finding the humor amid the prevailing bittersweetness of life. Speaking of Oscars, the great DeNiro is great once again here.With leads as winning as Cooper and Lawrence, and Russell\\'s signature mix of clever and sincere dialogue, the hook is set.This meaningful film keeps the laughs, giddy anxiousness and warm butterflies from the trailer and sustains it all through two full hours of a love story.Lawrence, in her most high-low, sad-comic turn yet, is remarkable.Until the characters can take their needs seriously and laugh at themselves, at least a little, they\\'re not going to be healthy. Playbook traces all their journeys from stubborn self-assertion to a fragile connectedness that might lead to lasting bonds.It shouldn\\'t work - there\\'s just too much going on. But it does. Spectacularly. Go see it.Just the sort of rom-com you\\'d expect from a director who once came to blows with George Clooney.Just about everybody in the cast of David O. Russell\\'s strange and disturbing and deeply romantic new film has the chance to act with a capital A.This is a really funny film with some great performances, but sadly the second half shows that Russell lost track of what was important in the story. This still balances out to a good movie, [but] it could have been great had it stayed on course.The film is at once heartfelt and funny, farcical and sincere, and packed with performances that pull off that difficult balancing act. In short, it\\'s a masterpiece.There\\'s nothing wrong with the overrated Jennifer Lawrence that some serious acting lessons couldn\\'t improve. The rest of the actors are pretty much on their own.For a movie that seems at times to have no idea what it\\'s trying to do, \"Silver Linings Playbook\" is compulsively watchable.Unlike typical romantic genre fare, its jagged edges will make the characters and film a challenge for some viewers, which is the reason why others embrace it.Sharp of tongue, generous of spirit, Silver Linings Playbook is a jagged, loopy romantic comedy about \"crazy\" people that insists, deep down, we\\'re all a little nuts.The Silver Linings Playbook\" defies categorization: it\\'s both comedy and drama, without fitting neatly into either genre.The film is just as clumsy about psychological issues as Hollywood movies generally are, but Jennifer Lawrence\\'s performance makes all that moot.David O. Russell\\'s latest entertaining ode to lovable characters you should probably be afraid of. Going deep without resorting to trick plays, the sure-handed \"Silver Linings Playbook\" scores on every possession.Some movies are so likable, so naturally charming, that you\\'ll forgive any dopey idea they throw at you.David O. Russell has pulled off a tricky feat here, finding just the right tone in crafting a romantic comedy whose sweethearts suffer from bipolar disorder and depression.Silver Linings Playbook isn\\'t perfect - the ending is untidy - but it may just be the year\\'s best comedy.Pretty much a miscalculation from beginning to end.Silver Linings Playbook is a rare thing indeed - a romantic comedy that completely delivers on both sides of the equation. A deliriously funny and disarmingly poignant love story that\\'s sure to brighten the outlook of even the hardest cynic.A well-paced and whip-smart screenplay.Russell\\'s deft writing, and the ensemble cast, keep it light and entertaining. The ending is a bust, but there\\'s a wealth of good stuff here.Cooper and Lawrence have a nice, believable chemistry, and by the time they get to the dance competition it\\'s surprising how tense it is and much you are rooting for them.Jennifer Lawrence is the standout in a tonally uneven, eccentric romantic dramedy that fuses The Fisher King with Romy And Michele\\'s High School Reunion.Tinged with shadows and ignited by Lawrence and Cooper, Silver Linings Playbook raises the bar on romantic comedy. It\\'s crazy good.It\\'s lopsided and spotty, but it\\'s alive in a way that suddenly makes you remember to what degree most Hollywood movies aren\\'t.Unlikely and engaging, this quirky, off-beat romantic dramedy is a cheerfully enjoyable crowd-pleaser.Silver Linings Playbook is Cooper and Lawrence\\'s show.With Silver Linings Playbook, David O. Russell has again recalibrated, and achieved the quirky yet poignant balance of his best early work. David O. Russell is screwing with us. He\\'s seeing how many indie rom-com tropes he can juggle at the same time and still make it work, with one big twist: Brad Cooper is the Manic Pixie Dream Girl with a penis.It\\'s smart, edgy, and filled with some of the best performances of the yearOffbeat dramedy mixes light and dark; some intense moments.What starts off as a serious examination of mental illness turns into an entirely different movie, one with nearly the exact same third act as \"High School Musical.\" Contrived, but beautifully cast and very entertaining.Pat and Tiffany\\'s love story may only be possible in the movies, but damned if the actors don\\'t make it seem real.It\\'s Lawrence who knocked me sideways. I loved her in Winter\\'s Bone and The Hunger Games but she\\'s very young - I didn\\'t think she had this kind of deep-toned, layered weirdness in her.David O. Russell returns to his distinctive brand of neurotic screwball comedy, and like his early features Spanking the Monkey and Flirting With Disaster, this one somersaults giddily from sanity to insanity to sanity again. Consistently funny and, as it builds to its conclusion, also very sweet fun.Silver Linings\" feels different and fresh, also sincere.It\\'s tiresome to hear reviewers hyping this or that funny movie as \"the year\\'s best,\" so I won\\'t. But you get the idea.\\'Silver Linings Playbook\\' is fun, sharp and sometimes moving, but it\\'s not reinventing any kind of wheel.A determinedly offbeat romance and rather knowing portrait of self-destructive behavior.Like a production of When Harry Met Sally put on by the characters from One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest. Silver Linings uses cliches like a straight-jacket, containing an otherwise nutty film and making it safe for audiences to approach.It might be contrived that way, but we are willing to forgive and accept because the path to what we expect is rewarding. Cooper gives his most natural, affecting and compelling performance yet...Lawrence makes us forget her dewy youth just minutes into her brittle, biting turn as a woman whose unbalanced rage is even more cleverly concealed...Because of Lawrence, I just can\\'t write off this movie.Would that every feel-good movie came by its good feelings so honestly.Silver Linings Playbook is, like its protagonist, hopelessly optimistic ... and it\\'s a sign of the film\\'s potency that we buy into it with our own sense of hopefulness.... this is a film with its own cadence, its own particular sense of music, and it is a tremendous success for writer/director David O. Russell.A bittersweet romantic comedy, plain and simple, and, by the time it has added in subplots involving dance competitions and football superstitions, also rather unwieldy.It\\'s a strain to care about Pat, and it\\'s impossible to believe in his world.An unfussy, rambling crowd-pleaser that recalls elements of the filmmaker\\'s past work ...Silver Linings is consistently entertaining, with its scrappy, well-drawn characters, offbeat humor and indefatigable positive outlook.The movie doesn\\'t break any thematic ground, and in other hands this same material might have made for an insufferable Katherine Heigl vehicle. But Russell and his cast make it sing - and soar, too. Dramatic, emotional, even heartbreaking, as well as wickedly funny, it has the gift of going its own way, a complete success from a singular talent....that rare thing, a top notch comedy orchestrated by a director with a talent for teasing out the unexpected.Cooper\\'s performance meets Lawrence\\'s, beautifully, halfway.Everything comes together brilliantly in \"Silver Linings Playbook\"-for the film\\'s crazed but uncrazy lovers; for the filmmaker, David O. Russell, and best of all for lucky us.No matter how grim it\\'s looking for certain kinds of laughter, as long as there\\'s David O. Russell, things will be OK.Silver Linings Playbook,\" the exuberant new movie from David O. Russell, does almost everything right.Silver Linings Playbook is an infectiously rousing crowd-pleaser about psychological damage and emotional healing, which would seem oxymoronic if not for the authentic, insightful atmosphere and marvelous performances.Anyone seeking proof that a movie can transcend its subject should look to Silver Linings Playbook.It\\'s clever and cute and never lets you forget it, winning in spite of how much it insists on it.Cooper\\'s much better than usual, while the always-great Lawrence is particularly fantastic.I say good for Russell for risking a protagonist who requires some patience and forgiveness.It\\'s the perfect material for Russell, who not only deals perceptively with the dizzying swings of manic depression, but makes it the fabric of a big, generous, happy-making ensemble comedy.Silver Linings Playbook\" is so good, it could almost be a terrific old classic. While the ultimate takeaway from Silver Linings Playbook is, as the title suggests, optimistic, it\\'s not just because the film has two recognizable stars and a cutesy premise.A solid cast delivers in a movie that is thoroughly enjoyable if not consistently great.It\\'s not often that a movie can affect you and make you laugh out loud all at once, but \"Silver Linings Playbook\" coordinates the task with ease.Most of the way, the film\\'s deficiencies are survivable if only for Jennifer Lawrence and some fleeting moments of emotional clarity and bracing conflict.Russell pitches the action at a manic, screwball pace, and the cast is more than up to the task, with Cooper and Lawrence attracting and repelling each other with equal dynamism.Playbook\" walks a tightrope in how it portrays mental illness -- deriving humor out of its characters\\' actions while demonstrating just how deep-rooted their problems are.A razor sharp, unfiltered exploration of recovery and reconciliation. Manic as it might be stylistically, emotionally Silver Linings Playbook maintains too even of a keel.David O Russell\\'s movie to love raises the bar on what has become the traditional rom-com.Disney\\'s Enchantedis a fun homage to all the Walt Disney Animation Studios classics.Director Kevin Lima\\'s new film Enchanted is seemingly made for all the women who grew up on fairytale endings. But growing up is perhaps the wrong word to use. Permanently infantilized might be a better term.In Enchanted, even the vermin whistle while they work.In the hands of Adams, the evolution elicits as much sympathy as it does laughter, largely because she grounds every pivotal moment in wide-eyed kindness and generosity, pushing us to care about her fate.After about half-an-hour the comic steam is dispersed by whimsy, though Timothy Spall is pretty funny as the Evil Stepmother\\'s varlet valet.Delightful stuff.This delightfully funny and smart family film certainly lives up to its title. By the time you are reading this, the ads will already be proclaiming that Enchanted is \"enchanting,\" and for once they\\'ll be spot on.The result is a fresh, feel-good crowd-pleaser that pokes affectionate fun at fairytale conventions while remaining true to their spirit.Narrated by Julie Andrews with Marsden gleefully camping it up and Adams the personification of winning charm, only a Scrooge would deny the film possesses oodles of fun and wit. It\\'s just not as enchanting as it deserves to be.Sometimes the big studios get it right. Enchanted is a high-concept fish-out-of-water tale that works on so many levels it\\'s dizzying. Plus, it features a breakout performance by the luminous Amy Adams.Enchanted is as conventional as the films it tries to satirize.Amy Adams is a star in the making.This large-scale Disney family film is sheer delight.There\\'s no big shocker ending in Enchanted, and it follows a pretty typical formula, but what makes it a winner is its ability to make you smile anyway. Be forewarned, you might even get a cheek ache.Enchanted is a sweet romantic fable, with some loveable performances and some genuine good humour.Warm, funny and delightfully nostalgic, this is a must-watch this Christmas for the whole family.Amy Adams is the reason to see Enchanted, the only reason, but she is so good and committed to a role most actress would play with a knowing smirk, that reason is more than enough.For the first time, perhaps ever, Disney turns the reflecting mirror at itself, allowing for some inspired fun at its own expense.Like the Cinderella figure she plays in Disney\\'s Enchanted, Amy Adams spreads a contagion of delight. The movie is great fun, but she\\'s enchanting.You get the sense that Lima and writer Bill Kelly barely scratched the surface of possibilities of their clever but largely unexplored gimmick.It\\'s the simple charm and humour of the tale that lingers in the memory.Happily, the leads carry the day: James Marsden as a prince of grinning vanity, Susan Sarandon as the wicked stepmother, and, above all, Amy Adams, who, in the role of a would-be princess, finds true momentum, not just sappiness, in the farce of innocence.Amy Adams announces herself as a viable new commercial leading lady in Enchanted, a genial family film which finds animated fairytale characters thrust into the real world.Enchanted still provides a pleasant twist on Walt Disney\\'s traditional output and has enough decent performances from its cast to raise titters and smiles from even the most grumpy movie-goers.Enchanted is rich in Disney iconography, the best recipient of which is Susan Sarandon as the wicked Queen. The film in general really benefits from a stellar production team that create the feeling of a classic Disney film in the real world.It pulls out all the stops in hitting all the familiarities of the genre and spins it on its head in both a fun and intelligent way. Snobs will hate it because of its happily ever after ending. Everyone else will love it for the exact same reason. After all, a little fantasy never hurt anyone.It rides on the charm of its actors, particularly Amy Adams as the hapless, homicidally upbeat princess and James Marsden as her would-be prince charming.Disney offers a delightfully affectionate, and surprisingly entertaining, parody of its own traditions.As close as you can get to a family-friendly, live-action satire of Disney animation, made all the better since Disney itself made the film.Though the film is full of allusions to the Disney canon, they are generally unobtrusive echoes rather than eager satires. This is a children\\'s movie at which adults are also welcome, not a cartoon for grownups.It is rare for me to use a term like \\'magical\\' to describe a film, but this movie deserves it....an admittedly overlong yet thoroughly engaging effort that brings a fresh spin to the old fish-out-of-water formula.Disney\\'s self-mocking combination of animation and live-action is not without its charm, but so slim is the satire that the result comes dangerously close to resembling a cheap imitation by a moderately talented wannabe.Its gimmick allows, in our post-ironic era, big musical production numbers in Central ParkThere is no doubt about it - Amy Adams is the sole reason Walt Disney Pictures\\' \"Enchanted\" is so, well, enchanting.[T]hink of it as The Purple Rose of Cairo for kids.Lo and behold, the film held my interest the whole way through, and yes...even made me chuckle here and there.It may not win over diehard Disney haters, and it doesn\\'t qualify as great filmmaking, but I bet kids will be enjoying this one for decades to come.A delightful family-friendly holiday confection.Enchanted is, indeed, enchanting.Chock full of intriguing twists and turns, plus many memorable musical numbers, this instant Disney classic is a pleasant escape that\\'s fun for young and old.This modern-day, partly animated fairy tale is a cheery love story, yes, but it\\'s also a little Scream and a lot of Hairspray, cleverly sending up its shamelessly feel-good genre yet sending you off with a fizzy high nonetheless.The perfect family film for the festive season.For a movie filled with magical occurences, Enchanted commits a cardinal sin: It forgets to cast a spell on the audience.All the fairy-taley wrap-up is decidedly less wonderful than young Morgan\\'s insight and gumption. Surrounded by calculated Disnifications, she\\'s both imperfect and convincing.A cute family comedy that\\'s perfectly safe for even the tots to attend.It\\'s Adams who casts the spell.With its latest movie, Enchanted, Disney is having some fun at its own expense. Gentle fun, it has to be said.Amy Adams provides the pixie dust that turns New York into a land of enchantment.Enchanted bubbles over with good cheer, due in large part to Adams for the wide-eyed optimism and innocence she brings to her irony-free performance.The songs, by \"Pocahontas\" Oscar-winners Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, are cleverly written, with each one evoking a Disney classic from another period.This family film is fun, but essentially paint-by-numbers.The animated sequences are disappointingly flat, the real-life parts underwritten, but Amy Adams works hard and keeps a straight face in the lead, and the time passes amiably enough.It quickly becomes obvious that instead of finding a fresh angle of approach, the filmmakers have simply given us yet another fish-out-of-water fantasy a la \"Splash.A triumphant return to form.The comic possibilities, once floated, eventually capsize.Overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink-wrap of corporate Disney plastic-ness.Beginning like the classic animated stories, with a beautiful princess being rescued by a handsome prince, it raises a laugh immediately with a brilliant send-up of the saccharin duets the young lovers usually sing.Susan Sarandon is terrific as the Evil Queen; Timothy Spall pops up like a well-used wart; and James Marsden is the terrifically thick and handsome Prince.It\\'s not quite as enchanted or magical as it could have been, but this family romp still manages to be good fun, and is lifted by fantastic turns from Amy Adams and James Marsden.Enchanting, fantastic fun for all the family.A charming family-friendly film complete with a beautiful music score.Subversive enough for older brother, sweet enough for kid sis, this cine-panto\\'s a safe if not spectacular choice for a Chrimbo family outing. The cartoon chipmunk almost steals it, but Adams\\' dippy dazzle is the movie\\'s heart, soul and lungs.Enchanted? You will be.Thoroughly delightful and entertaining, this is exactly the type of movie Walt Disney would make if he were alive today.Once upon a time, the Disney studios showed off a clever way to blend animation and live action.For the most part this is a perky delight that takes a cheeky glee in biting the gloved hand that feeds.Enchanting for most of its running time.The dedicated fairy tale fan will have tons of fun spotting all the references. Adams, meanwhile, gives one of the comedy performances of the year.This magical fantasy-in-reverse is perhaps the best family film of the year.Disney can afford to poke fun at a lot of things about itself, and in Enchanted, it does exactly that, to largely charming effect.A sweet little film for anyone that enjoys blurring the lines between fantasy and reality. Climaxes strongly. Has moments of greatness and moments of not-so-greatness.The delightful Enchanted gives Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs a sweetly subversive spin.Playing her fairytale character with giddy aplomb, Amy Adams gives a winsomely energetic performance as the live-action version of maiden Giselle.Enchanted offers us five-stars worth of Amy Adams in four-stars worth of movie. That\\'s not a bad average.There are probably a few actresses who could play the role of an animated Disney princess come to life, but let\\'s be thankful it\\'s Amy Adams who is playing it.Amy Adams does something akin to what Johnny Depp did in the first Pirates picture: take a potentially generic Disney movie and invest it with a sublimely inventive performance that takes the overall product to a whole other level.The kids and adults can dig this one, though adults may be stricken with Disney deja vu by this point.To my pleasure, the delightful Enchanted stands out in a season full of violent and drug-ridden movies.If the mere notion of Disney returning to their roots doesn\\'t at least bring a tiny bit of a smile to your face, then you are, I\\'m sorry, completely dead inside.Disney\\'s Enchanted is the sweet, lighthearted antithesis to the more serious fare this holiday season, fueled by a thoroughly captivating performance from Amy Adams.Maintains a delicate balance between wish-fulfillment fantasy and a recognition that the world inhabited by its audience is filled with disappointment as well as with joy...Watching Amy Adams exude her comical charm is alone worth the price of admission.Sarandon\\'s wicked queen switches it up as a witch on the down low, exuding bad vibes crackling with charismatic menace. Even if a bit like a real queen also notorious for not taking a liking in the least to her own royal offspring\\'s choices in women.A very nice enjoyable fluffy movie.A surprisingly entertaining movie that possesses the trademark Disney magic while administering a few well-deserved jabs in the ribs at the same time.Enchanted earns its label as a \"family film\" by virtue of its ability to captivate audience members both young and old.With its buoyant combination of romance, music and fun, \\'Enchanted\\' emerges as one of the most entertaining films of the year.It makes for good family viewing....winsomely clever...The first half of this film is just pure joy.This is a film Walt himself would have been proud of, a family flick that\\'s marvelously gratifying no matter what your age.What pushes the film over the top is the terrific turn by Adams, who really seems like a Disney heroine come to life.I walked in there all crabby, tired, bitter, and sad, and I walked out with a beatific smile on my face that not even Beowulf could remove entirely.Amy Adams looks and sounds as if she indeed emerges from a fairy-tale land.Adams is somehow more cartoonish than the animated version of Giselle at the beginning of the film.Wonderful family entertainment.Adams carries Enchanted\\'s fairy-tale conceit on her tiny shoulders - and on her, it floats as if sprinkled with pixie dust.The gag wouldn\\'t work with just anyone in the lead, but Adams\\' openhearted performance never winks. She really does want the best for everyone, and can\\'t fathom why they don\\'t all feel the same.If I have my druthers Adams will get her second Oscar nomination, part of me even hoping she can pull of the same Julie Andrews Mary Poppins miracle and actually win the darn golden statue outright.Maybe it\\'s not a whole new world, but it\\'s one you already know and love quite well.Disney goes meta in this witty, exuberant musical comedy whose parody and nostalgia serve a sweet and affecting romance.Portraying a version of Disney\\'s Snow White, [Adams] owns the character, down to every warble and twirl.An inspired Disney fairy-tale mash-up.Enchanted is not a perfect movie ... But it is so thoroughly delightful when Adams is on screen you forgive its faults with a smile.What could have been an epic Disney misfire is saved by the charming Adams.Wonderful performances by Amy Adams and James Marsden as the real-life versions of a classic Disney princess and her prince charming. They are magnificent.Enchanted isn\\'t just a culture-clash fable, it\\'s also a throwback to one of classic Hollywood\\'s giddiest genres: the screwball comedy.Charming.

Naomi Watts is terrific as Rachel; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation.The fear is not so much of physical danger, but of just the impenetrability of the mystery.I\\'m now officially scared of being alone in the same room with a television.The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is thoroughly atmospheric, making a sharply incisive visual contribution to the theme of demonic powers.I found The Ring moderately absorbing, largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound.A ridiculous, confusing mess that just doesn\\'t make any sense.The \"Death Tape\" of The Ring is nearly as incomprehensible as Mulholland Drive.

Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn\\'t back at Blockbuster before midnight, you\\'re going to face frightening late fees. O.K., not really.It\\'s up to [Watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario, and her presence succeeds in making us believe.Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you\\'ve imagined The Ring.The film\\'s murkiness and muted colors suggest the malaise of the treacherous limbo into which the characters wander.In the final reel, the tension dissipates with a flabby hiss, as the film devolves into a banal, conventional ghost story.More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat.Deeply unsettling, occasionally exasperating movie.If your senses haven\\'t been dulled by slasher films and gorefests, if you\\'re a connoisseur of psychological horror, this is your ticket.Even if parts don\\'t hold up in the daylight, the chill will stick to your bones.Good horror movies keep you up at night. And I\\'m really tired today.Something has been lost in the translation...another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise.The movie seems to have been slapped together without concern about whether anything makes sense.A very elegantly crafted piece of gothic snuff hokum.Viewers of \"The Ring\" are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes.Belief does need to be suspended to buy into The Ring\\'s story, but once you\\'ve done that, you\\'re in for a great ride.The Ring is worth a look, if you don\\'t demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your Halloween entertainment.Displaying a storytelling confidence unseen in most genre pictures, The Ring succeeds in being the most terrifying film to hit theaters since The Blair Witch Project.The Ring is fine cinema, blessed with an unusual respect for the horror genre and its own inherent silliness.Brrrrrrrrrrrr... definitely the scariest movie that I\\'ve seen so far this year.By-the-book Hollywood remake.A remarkably original and terrifying ghost tale.It tries to become a brainy horror movie without bothering to plug its many plot holes large enough to drive anyone with half a brain to distraction.With its draggy middle section, The Ring quickly deteriorates into just another collect-the-clues puzzle movie.The suspense is restrained and subtle, with some genuinely delicious scares.Boasts a real heart-stopper of a finale-an uncanny phosphor nightmare that depicts a marrow-deep fear shared by every kid who grew up in the video age.It\\'s been awhile since horror has been so nicely placed in a social context. The Ring is a gotta-see for those wanting to get creeped out.A merciless thriller, threateningly beautiful to look at and eerie to behold.These people are so passive and joyless that we\\'re not concerned about whether watching the tape will kill them: they all seem dead already.Although The Ring has horror picture elements, it is more of an intriguing mystery and detective story than a shocker.It\\'s not THE SIXTH SENSE, but close enough.The best horror film since \\'The Sixth Sense,\\' \\'The Changeling\\' and \\'Psycho\\'...with a timely Halloween release, it\\'s an eerie, enigmatic scare story about a supernatural videotape. Sure, it\\'s an implausible gimmick movie - but how gullible are you? I suspeThough not quite as anxious or callous as Stigmata, The Ring has been similarly put together with attention deficit disorder.gets too literal, then goes overboard into outright ludicrousnessThe result is a film that lacks the coherence, and the subsequent horror, of the Japanese oeuvre and made me just want to get the thing over with.An undeniably creepy, unnerving experience that turns mundane things -- a refrigerator door, a ringing telephone, TV static -- into moments of terrific suspense....The Ring is far scarier than any of the recent so-called horror flicks to hit theaters...Compelling, yet dissappointing.nannannan... almost two and a half hours in which [Julia Roberts] displays her charisma... [Full review in Spanish]An engaging but deliberate chick flick at times, Eat, Pray, Love has the quintessential chick flick star at the helm with Roberts, who played the role beautifully... The unexamined privilege, the idealization/exotification of all places east, the canned spirituality, the sensual goddamn spaghetti-it\\'s all so focus-group-tested and Oprah approved and self-perpetuating and embarrassing. Let\\'s face it. There are some books that should never be made into movies.This gentle, meditative, well-told tale has a lot to offer.Eat Pray Love is overlong and quickly becomes tedious. It features narcissistic, inward looking characters of no interest at all and amounts to a very poorly made film.Liz maybe the most unlikeable character Julia Roberts has ever had to play, not because co-writer/director Ryan Murphy is trying to make her so but because everything the film does pushes her in that direction.A seemingly interminable romantic travelogue that feels as though it takes as long to watch as the year-long spiritual quest it depicts.The film version is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy.Julia\\'s late career seems an apologia for buying someone else\\'s husband and getting away with it, for the most part, in the court of public opinion.During the India scenes, Liz accuses Richard from Texas of spouting a bunch of bumper-sticker slogans... as though her revelations are any better.[Takes] itself too seriously, even while it contains all the trappings of one of the most lighthearted movie genres, the \\'travel romance\\' or \\'travel therapy\\' movie.full review at Movies for the MassesMerely good and not great as many fans of the book hoped it would be.Eat Pray Love is a two hour and fifteen minute ad for being rich; it\\'s a smug, patronising travelogue that -- despite its already apt title -- could have also been called First World Problems: The Movie. On the surface a beautiful film. But those looking for some hidden spiritual meaning be warned - Eat Pray Love doesn\\'t go that deep.Eat Pray Love ... [hits] its target demographic right between the eyes, but in the same way that a self-help book may appeal to thousands, it will never be great literature. Narcissistic nonsense, styled within an inch of its life in the manner of food, fashion and travel magazines.The fatal flaw of Eat Pray Love is that for a celebration of enlightenment through travel and the benefits of restorative calm, the end result is so hollow and artificial. Don\\'t mistake entitlement for enlightenment.A tiresome, humourless, lifeless, overlong dirge in which the lofty pretention to say something deep about the quest for self and the female condition all gets blown away by an insipid, off-the-shelf romantic-movie ending.The chemistry shared by Roberts and Bardem is alert, alive and alluring: everything the rest of Eat Pray Love should have been, but shied away from.The director, Ryan Murphy, brings only the most obvious sentiments to the borderline intolerable proceedings.There?s too much eating, too much praying and too much loving. I should have known given the title.Basically a picaresque rom-com about a girl who needs to feel OK about having everything she could ever want.It is a perfectly competently constructed movie, and an enjoyable one too.Give me real emotions of guilt, embarrassment and confusion any day over the forgettable trite this film exudes.While undeniably a chick flick, this is a classy one bolstered by an all-round excellent cast and well crafted script.While it touches the main plot points of Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s bestselling novel like stepping stones, it is left to Julia Roberts\\' bewitching smile and Javier Bardem\\'s sensuality to convince us that Liz\\'s journey of self discovery is one we want to takePreaching to the converted, fans of the book should be sated. Julia Roberts is easy to love.Eat lots of popcorn to distract you, pray for it to end, and love Richard Jenkins. Amen.It\\'s in equal measure patronising, sententious and obnoxious.A sparkier and more soul-searching script would have made this a much more satisfying journey.An insipid slice of take-charge-of-your-life hokum...A film titled Eat Pray Love should at least capture a spiritual experience and offer romance with some sizzle. This felt more like Eat Grieve Befriend.Roberts is luminous against breathtaking locations including all of Rome\\'s landmarks and colourful, sun-nourished eastern landscapes.A movie of picture postcard landscapes and ridiculously hunky blokes, this is very much cinematic comfort food where the answers to life\\'s problems come a little too neatly gift-wrapped.In the end, the film is far less affecting or thought-provoking than the book.Sit, watch, groan. Yawn, fidget, stretch. Eat Snickers, pray for end of dire film about Julia Roberts\\'s emotional growth, love the fact it can\\'t last for ever. Wince, daydream, frown.What\\'s the worst foreign journey you\\'ve ever experienced? Mine is this movie.Roberts\\' character is difficult to feel sorry for before she sets off on this postcardperfect self-healing binge. She becomes near impossible to like as it becomes apparent we\\'re watching a huge holiday video.The cast is spectacular: Roberts looks relaxed, luminous and credible, Javier Bardem is suitably rugged as her new lover, while Richard Jenkins is brilliant as her grumbling prayer pal.An intriguing story brimming with possibilities is softened beyond all meaning by this glossy Hollywood production.A beautiful, languid travelogue, although with some of the source novel\\'s empowerment diluted.The movie is aware of its own riches; it fills up your plate and dares you not to eat.If you like Roberts and understand what it means to \\'\\'smile with your liver\\'\\', this is the film for you.Avoid Like Plague.Eat Pray Love has some decent performances and the occasional good moment but it\\'s ultimately let down by a tedious, self-satisfied script, a shocking lack of humour and a criminally indulgent running time.I admired Julia Roberts\\' grasping for something meatier, but this film sticks her with an unrelatable character that even her coltish smile can\\'t beautify.A drive-through take on mid-life spirituality - with lots of food and travel pornWe\\'re not so much involved in the movie as idly registering it -- eavesdropping, almost, on a conversation at an adjoining table.Enough compelling moments to make one want to grab the book and fill in the blanks that the movie\\'s script seems to have left out.Eat, Pray, Love was more like eat, pray for it to end, gag. Sample from its menu at your own risk.Though many movies have explored Eastern culture and juxtaposed it against the American experience, there still is something to learn here, especially because it repeatedly questions what\\'s important in life.It does focus on spirituality, a vital part of most human beings which nevertheless is absent in most films.... is [Elizabeth] Gilbert really the selfish, shallow, immature narcissist we see here?You have got to be kidding me.Go Pay SufferThe absolute best I can say about this movie is that I didn\\'t hate it, I didn\\'t mind watching it and I see no reason to ever watch it again.... a self-indulgent, annoying and mostly boring movie.little more than a self-indulgent wallow in white upper-class privilege feigning depth by cloaking itself in fortune cookie wisdomWhat\\'s inevitably lost is any real attempt to track Liz\\'s internal shifts, the way her travels jostle her preconceived notions of selfhood and spirituality.As summer draws to a close, Eat Pray Love is a pleasurable, sometimes even prayerful, escape.Despite splendid scenery and an appealing Julia Roberts, the film of Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s best-seller about her year-long spiritual quest fails to capture the humor and uplift of the book.Fans of the memoir might enjoy this film; others will be checking their watches more than once. I saw it. I didn\\'t feel it. Look, I\\'m happy for Julia Roberts to travel the world. I just never felt connected to the journey of Liz. The audience may find itself wondering how it is that Liz manages to find so many places around the world that can maintain her carefully highlighted hair rather than contemplating the spiritual journey Try not to hoot when the gaunt Roberts makes a bring-on-the-flab speech to persuade the equally slender Tuva Novotny to eat pizza, even if they get \"muffin tops.A nice leisurely pace.The result isn\\'t spiritual awakening, but a talky travelogue - like riding a tour bus with a passenger who won\\'t shut up about her inner journey.Julia Roberts continues to be one of our finest actresses, and she makes this film less tedious than it could have been. It\\'s a shame the actors have to spoil cinematographer Robert Richardson\\'s artistry by reciting the drivel that passes for dialog.Rodney [Dangerfield] may have cracked about \"praying after you eat,\" but this film reflects the need to surfeit before finding balance.Let the cynics scoff - this is a movie that\\'s beautiful to look at that will leave you with some food for thought, as well. While Eat Pray Love has some enlightening, touching, visually breathtaking moments, you still end up praying it would end.Eat, pray, love? More like eat, pray, snooze.Roberts is precisely the right actress to play this character: She adamantly refuses to be adorable -- she\\'d rather just unleash that crazy, unladylike cackle.If you\\'re in the mood for a Julia Roberts film that provides two hours of \"Calgon take me away\", this is it.If you\\'ve ever been on a vacation that becomes an adventure of meeting interesting, vibrant people, \"Eat Pray Love\" will bring you back.If only this movie could have stopped at \"Eat.The movie left me with the feeling of being trapped with a person of privilege who won\\'t stop with the whine whine whine.Do you always talk in bumper sticker? Julia Roberts asks Richard Jenkins as they banter back and forth at an ashram in India. Yes, he does. And so does Eat Pray Love. Exotic, escapist and superficially spiritual, it\\'s shallow, indulgent female wish-fulfillment, sailing off into the sunset.Betray Devour Invade\" would have been a more appropriate title. The movie, which was shot in chronological order in the countries Gilbert visited, is also visually striking, more reminiscent of a travelogue than a Hollywood blockbuster.Eat Pray Love is ultimately charming and inspirational. Though it doesn\\'t have quite the impact of the book, it will likely leave you pondering your life choices and forgiving your flaws. It will certainly have you forgiving the few flaws in the film. This is the rare \"chick flick\" that treats its demographic with respect, never becoming the sentimental or manipulative dreck that so many other filmmakers would have delivered from Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s bestselling memoirs.Eat Pray Love is like an overstuffed lightweight suitcase, with little room for us to feel the emotional connections Liz makes with new friends along the way.Hanging out with Julia Roberts being all glowy and charming -- even when she\\'s somewhat sad about whatever it is she\\'s sad about -- is still kind of pleasurable.Eat Pray Love only superficially advocates independence and growth while serving up a steaming pile of pseudo-spiritual hyperbole. This film is about a woman trying to move mountains to make herself happy, and the singular quest of every other character in the movie is to serve her in that quest. An insane fantasy for rich people.Eat Pray Love\" rests on Roberts\\' talented shoulders. Her appeal and personality overcome most of the film\\'s defects, including a too-long running time, and some platitudes and words of wisdom that sound as if they were written by Hallmark.It may come as a bit of a shock to some that the most interesting turns in the woman-on-a-quest sojourn don\\'t belong to Roberts, luminous though she is. Those are owned by a number of misty-eyed if masculine menfolk.Goldilocks And The Three Boy Toys. While in search of the chick flick demographic, the misguided message is that hedonism is the new feminism. But Liz does learn a few things, like mastering the art of guilt-free eating and embracing your inner fatty.Eat. Pray. Love. Barf....A celebration of self-indulgence trying to pass itself off as profound soul-searching.The movie is above all a lovely travelogue, plunging us viscerally into the middle of every country.I stopped trusting the movie.It\\'s all external trappings trying to express internal developments, and the movie\\'s hand-holding stridency just emphasizes the artificiality of its fantasy.There\\'s something ridiculously and deeply sad about what Eat Pray Love reveals about the deprived lives American women lead.Find-your-bliss film appeals but raises questions, too.One wonders: Was the screenplay presented to Julia Roberts as a traditional bound manuscript, or as a catalog of bumper stickers?For two decades, Julia Roberts has been a bona fide movie star, and she shines in his gorgeous if overlong travelogue.Eat Pray Love is a long marathon full of self pity and poor interaction.Eat Pray Love presents Liz\\'s road to enlightenment in ways that are too reverent, too episodic, and too self-absorbed.It\\'s a thin line between \"self-aware\" and \"self-involved\" and it\\'s one the movie treads uncertainly.Despite its flaws, an intelligent, beautiful-looking film about the power of one person to radically change the life of another is an unexpected treat in a season of mindless entertainment.A hornet\\'s nest of irrational behavior, wrapped up snugly in a smug, shallow, and diseased feature film that does a masterful job brainlessly wiggling around for an interminable amount of screentime. The film\\'s most crucial constituency -- the book\\'s rabid fans -- are likely to feel well served by Murphy\\'s adaptation, which hews pretty faithfully to Gilbert\\'s story.A vacuous attempt at chick flick epiphany. For all its postcard prettiness, Eat Pray Love\\'s purported life lessons are so self-absorbed, had our shallow heroine been a man, we\\'d be booing his caddish behaviour.You know exactly what you are going to get, kinda like comfort food for your movie going soul.Comes off more like a female midlife crisis fantasy than a substantive search for knowledge and inner peace.Eat Pray Love is the cure for insomnia. The film is boring and a gigantic advertisement for The Travel Channel, Food Network and Lifetime. It\\'s about something important, the search for meaning and happiness, about finding one\\'s inner life amid the clutter and confusion of modern existence.... an irritating, smug film about a horrible person, a narcissistic destroyer of worlds so caught up in romancing her impossibly sensitive self that she doesn\\'t even notice the needless damage she inflicts on her fellow creatures.Eat Pray Love is mostly a slog; never giving us a compelling reason why its heroine does what she does, or how she became quite so tiresomely self- absorbed.I\\'ve got a fourth verb to add to the comma-challenged title of Julia Roberts\\' how-to-be-happy travelogue, Eat Pray Love. How about \"edit\"?Most of what made the book connect with so many is entirely missing here.Was something lost in translation or was the source material not as strong as book sales would have us believe?Overlong, repetitive, too simplistic, and bland despite oodles of breathtaking scenery. It\\'s like a healthy dish that looks aesthetically pleasing, but lacks flavor and needs a more talented chef. At the end of the two and a half hours we get to the same point of all the other stereotypical chick flicks. This is an overly intellectual version of any other Jennifer Lopez or Kate Hudson romantic comedy.The film, which admittedly stumbles in the home stretch and just misses out on something like greatness, is nonetheless a visual and metaphysical delight. Come hungry, come searching, come lonely.[These] are not the teachings one would find for oneself but things out of a self-help book. They feel planned.It\\'s hard to call this a bad movie as it is wonderfully and beautifully shot and directed, but its failure to grasp any meaning in its end and its steady decent into boredom make it a failure as a movie overall.I found the woman to be selfish, narcissistic and by the time everything was over I didn\\'t actually believe she learned anything new about herself at all.Eat Pray Love lies across the screen like a patient on life support whose ticker is about to tick its last tock.A minor and superficial summer diversion that offers female viewers not much more than a two-hour escape fantasy.Awesome photography but possessing more schmaltz than herring shoppers will find at Zabar\\'s on a Sunday shopping spree.There were plenty of ways for the film to signify Liz welcoming love back into her life without the trite conclusion that has been conceived here, and it is the one drawback to an otherwise pretty fantastic picture.Glibly portrays selfishness as a life choice, ranking gluttony on a par with finding God and a life partner.It helps that Roberts rides all the turbulent waves with such ease and such grace, that Jenkins knows exactly what to do with his internal churn, and that Bardem can do no wrong.An ambitious but confused and frustrating film that circles near catharsis, occasionally brushing its hem, but that\\'s about as close as it ever gets.Supply acted and engrossing.The book\\'s internal dialogue, that of a good observer with a lively mind, has turned into the extravagantly external and cloyingly earnest quest of a woman in deep distress.[Roberts] has a down-to-earth, Everywoman quality that adds to the film\\'s \"you go, girl\" mojo.Lives are messy. A little mess in the movie wouldn\\'t have hurt at all.Most of its supposed observations sound more like touchy-feely mumbo-jumbo than honest, useful information and advice.This is a movie about a self-obsessed woman who seems to learn that the wisdom of the ancients is that she should be even more self-obsessed. You know your movie\\'s in trouble when its star is outshined by a bowl of spaghetti.An effective and frequently satisfying indulgence, but not nearly as much as the book was.Ryan Murphy brings Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s best-selling self-realization memoir to the big screen as a glossy, Julia Roberts starring travelogue that gives more insight into where to get a great pizza than the benefits of striving for enlightenment.Let us not underestimate the contribution of our lead. Roberts plays down the glamour and turns up the soulfulness, and her off-the-charts likability makes her winning and watchable, even when Liz is at her whiny wimpiest.Roberts is the obvious focus here, but she\\'s enough of a pro to get out of the way and let a scene be stolen.vibrant editing, an intelligible screenplay, and a magnetic performance by Julia Roberts keep Eat, Pray from dipping too far into self-indulgence. Its span may be global, but its scope is modest, and it accepts a certain superficiality as the price of useful insight.The film knows the aesthetic of enlightenment, the filmmakers demonstrate adoration for their subject, but whether or not the film grasps the principle further is very arguable.Only hard-core fans of Oprah\\'s BFF will be able to stomach this navel-gazing tripe, which posits \"me-first\" consumerism as the road to happiness.Watching the relationship between Liz and Felipe evolve from a comforting friendship to a love that\\'s both companionable and sexy is gratifying.A well-meant, if not exactly transcendent, adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s beloved, Oprah-endorsed memoir.Eat Pray Love will be an intense spiritual experience for many who see it - they will end up on their knees, praying for its merciful end.An overlong bore that either mistakenly thinks it\\'s something more than a humdrum romance or has incorporated a variety of pretentions as window-dressing.A sensuous and emotionally cathartic adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s spiritual journey to personal transformation and love.Goldilocks And The Three Boy Toys. While in search of the chick flick demographic, the misguided message is that hedonism is the new feminism. But Liz does learn a few things, like mastering the art of guilt-free eating and embracing your inner fatty.At the moment, the only person eating more delectably in Italy is Tilda Swinton in I Am Love.Though there are a handful of funny lines, the deeper observations are facile. The whole journey feels like a rich girl gone slumming.Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s phenomenally popular memoir was funny, insightful, and well-written. Amazingly, so is the film. The superficial Eat Pray Love wants to chronicle a person\\'s rejuvenation through revelatory life experience, but it feels like tapas for the soul.The film is a fairly faithful transcription of events, even though Liz, as played by Roberts, carries a faint air of entitlement. I\\'m not sure this could be avoided on screen.Murphy\\'s film version of the story is relentlessly superficial, a slick, empty travelogue propped up only by Roberts\\' natural charisma.Like any beloved book with a pretty film version, there will be fans of this film, in spite of its flaws. And bless them. I was, mostly, frustrated.Julia Roberts boasts a charming presence and a lively mind but she deserves better than this superficial, glitzy and fluffy travelogue of self discovery, which has lots of food, some prayers but little love or sex.Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s best selling tome has been dumbed down and glossed up. Fans of the introspective will be disappointed: those looking for decent, escapist entertainment will not.Approached purely on the surface, Eat serves a sensual cinematic meal.It seems determined to drag tears out of the audience, when the quiet, underplayed moments are the ones that pack the true firepower.If only Roberts\\' warmth, coupled with Javier Bardem\\'s scruffy sexiness as Felipe, were enough to compensate for the folded-map flatness of this production.It provides a gorgeous escape, exquisitely photographed and full of female wish fulfillment. Yet it also offers sufficient emotional heft and self-discovery to make you feel as if you\\'ve actually learned something.Unlike the book, there\\'s no big emotional breakdown; instead, this is a postcard-pretty case of midlife soul-searching.Ryan Murphy\\'s film adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert\\'s bestseller about the divorced New Yorker\\'s lone odyssey to Italy, India and Bali to find meaning in her life is a shallow guilty pleasure: an escapist Julia Roberts romance and exotic travelogue. The food looks great, but the romance is undercooked, and God remains strictly a bit player.Eat Pray Love isn\\'t a bad movie -- just a spiritually dead one, wearing and wearying.Too preachy, indulgent, and everybody cries. Even the extras.Italians have a phrase -Che posso fare?- meaning \"What can I do?\" that\\'s sometimes used when the answer is: \"Nothing, just go with it.\" Lots of things happen in Eat Pray Love that only the lonely and book club members will understand. You just go with it.nannans there a heart-wrenching back story to explain why Diana is the way she is? Yes. Did I laugh? Yes. This film just made me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And I pretty much did. Not because the film is sad or anything; just because it is that unbelievably putrid.Identity Thief is one of those failed attempts to capture comedy magic.It is a creaky start, and matters fail to become smoother from there.There\\'s something to offend everyone in Identity Thief: racist jokes, gay jokes, the word \"vagina\" wielded as an insult.Don\\'t see it.Identity Thief exhausts you with slapstick. Though occasionally funny and filled with amusing bit-performances Identity Thief\\'s deeply unlikable co-protagonist stops this would-be buddy comedy in its tracks.Up until he becomes somewhat manly, Bateman\\'s character\\'s supreme ineptness is less funny than nerve-wracking. There\\'s way more grossness than hilarity. Don\\'t get conned.Director Seth Gordon\\'s best film since his brilliant debut, \"The King Of Kong: A Fistful Of Quarters....suffers from an often unwatchable first half that admittedly does give way to a passable final stretch......utterly confused over what to do with McCarthy as a physical comedienne.It\\'s like Midnight Run while at the same time completely missing what makes Midnight Run work. Melissa McCarthy deserves better.You don\\'t care enough about these people to want to see them come out on top.Bateman and McCarthy thrash around in the dark for laughs that never come.This ugly and rather mean-spirited film, with jokes that are so lowbrow they\\'re totally underfoot, creaks through a number of recycled road trip gags.The gags mostly grab at low-hanging fruit, frittering away the marvelous potential of Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy on an odd-couple road trip. The natural charisma of the two leads is about the only thing that saves Identity Thief; it\\'s a very generic, very lazy Hollywood comedy.Very little about Identity Thief is original. After a brief introduction that leads to Sandy and Diana travelling across the country together, viewers are saddled with a story that\\'s essentially a road movie with an Odd Couple twist.Bateman and McCarthy seem inspired enough to make this janky old jalopy of a story somewhat entertaining, playing to type with a lukewarm script.Sure, the two leads deserve better material, but there are enough laughs here to make up for a lot of creative mistakes-casting isn\\'t one of them....a yawner plot set-up that leads to lots of wannabe off-colour gags, a small army of pursuing villains and an expected final act in which Jason\\'s icky-sticky niceness might perhaps stop McCarthy from being a shrieking psychopath.Formulaic multiplex mulch, way over-long, often feels strained...That said, Identity Thief is the latest example of the disconnect that often exists between critical opinion and popular appeal. Slammed by critics the low-budget film has been a huge hit.Identity Thief molests the idea of the \\'odd couple\\' beyond recognition.Don\\'t let Identity Thief steal two hours of your life. The film\\'s darker elements are brushed aside and we\\'re left with a zany, feel-good finale.an unwieldy and unfunny farce that\\'s robbed of comic potential through its reliance on shrill mayhem over wit.When the plot feels like you\\'ve seen it three times before, and done better on each of those occasions, the movie better have something else going for it. Identity Thief doesn\\'t.The first thing I did after returning from the screening was take two painkillers for my throbbing headache. A man can only withstand so much shrill shrieking and faux-screwball antics.There\\'s probably a funny film buried somewhere deep within this concept of a morally corrupt protagonist, whose compulsion to steal identities finds her facing off with the man whose identity she has stolen, but this isn\\'t itIdentity Thief features the kind of \\'humour\\' which says you don\\'t just hit a person once, you should do it repeatedly to make it funnier.The film is painfully unfunny, almost literally so.There\\'s real potential in this premise for a ripping screwball comedy anchored by two likeable actors, but the filmmakers simply don\\'t trust the material, stirring in constant elements of action mayhem that don\\'t work at all.Feeble as comedy, the movie is needlessly violent, too, as if half the crew misguidedly thought they were making a foul-mouthed action thriller.The real crime here is the waste of comic talent.All pretty feeble stuff.Without the irrepressible force of comic mayhem that is Melissa McCarthy, road-movie comedy Identity Thief would end up in the ditch. Luckily, the Bridesmaids co-star barrels her way through the plot\\'s stickiest patches.Identity Thief starts off moronic and then goes downhill.It is reliant on McCarthy\\'s comedy chops and her ability to deliver improv-type character material, but almost every single one of her scenes looks like an outtake.Bateman and McCarthy are so fabulous in the overall, apart from this crap, and they, as actors and human beings, do not warrant the treatment they get here.Cheap laughs, cheap stunts, cheap characters and with absolutely nothing important to say.Identity Thief is low on laughs and has a number of plot problems but the comic performances from Bateman and McCarthy ensure that it stays watchable.[A] laugh-free affair despite the presence of the ever-reliable Jason Bateman and a supporting cast including Jon Favreau.The hit rate isn\\'t as high as you\\'d hope, gag-wise, but Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman remain highly likeable screen presences, even when behaving in unlikeable and unlikely ways.There\\'s barely a laugh to be found in this new comedy from Horrible Bosses director Seth Gordon.It saddles Bateman with a thankless uptight straight-man role while heaping serial slapstick ignominies on his co-star, who gamely bounds through everything the script throws at her.The film\\'s best moments are when McCarthy is left to her own improvisational devices with the camera still running, and that doesn\\'t happen often enough.Clever premise, witless execution.Identity Thief isn\\'t a great comedy in the class of McCarthy\\'s Bridesmaids, but it\\'s still a decent one ......[McCarthy] goes for it Bugs-Bunny-meets-the-Roadrunner-meets-all-three-Stooges-style. It\\'s just that the movie she\\'s single-handedly trying to save isn\\'t worth her effort.A wasted opportunity: put the two leads in a movie that didn\\'t lazily rely on its high concept to do the work, and you\\'d really have something to laugh about.When a straightforward description of the plot is funnier on an ironic level than any joke in the film, you\\'re in for a bad time. should have been a frothy farce, but instead takes several different attitudes, including action, melodrama, and mean-spirited nihilism. None of those are particularly successfulIdentity Thief\" gives Melissa McCarthy her full- fledged feature-film starring role. But the result is dispiriting, to say the least.Identity Theft is perfectly performed, often wildly funny, and a great movie night option for the not-easily-embarrassed.Bateman and McCarthy are asked to mine a garbage heap of gagsWhile the two leads are likable enough, they deserve better, especially McCarthy. Her range is criminally misused here -- it\\'s almost as if someone stole her comedic identity and committed a bad film in her name.[A] funny, though formulaic, mismatched-duo comedy ...The latest movie featuring Chris Farley and David Spade really stinks. Oh...wait...Lazy comedy doesn\\'t mean diddly-squat.It\\'s not perfect, but it is a wild \\'n\\' crazy road trip on the lighter side of a topic that, as a lot of folks have discovered, is no laughing matter. After setting up the professional and emotional devastation Jason Bateman\\'s character suffers when his identity is stolen, the movie does its best to say, \"You know what? Forget about that. Laugh at the crazy car crashes instead.Identity Thief is so bad that I hope it doesn\\'t prematurely squash people\\'s enthusiasm for Melissa McCarthy.Bateman and McCarthy elevate the material to a higher level than it should have.The scattered chuckles, while generally crude and obnoxious, might have more resonance if the film had some grounding in authenticity.Identity Thief is funny enough, but it needed to be darker, raunchier, and crazier to live up to the promise of its casting.A road movie with its creative lanes clogged, and a Mack truck comedian barreling through, anyway. Melissa McCarthy, pound-for-pound the funniest woman in show biz these days, carries this cruel and usual raunchfest practically by default. This is a movie for those who could care less about a bad premise or, for that matter, misfired gags, false sentimentality and obtuse characters.The snow might be tricky to predict. But the bad winter movies arrive right on scheduleIf Identity Thief suffers from comedic recession, Melissa McCarthy is too small a stimulus package.A waste of the talents of Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman.The theft of identity that\\'s going on here is the fact this thing is falsely advertising itself as a comedyIdentity Thief is an odd mix of edginess, slapstick, and serious drama that is only occasionally satisfying.I came away from \"Identity Thief\" with more admiration than ever for Melissa McCarthy, but I hope somebody will devise a better vehicle for her talents.Both Bateman and McCarthy are funny, but they really don\\'t have much chemistry, which is essential for a road comedy that locks two people in cars and hotel rooms together.It may be too soon to call Identity Thief the worst film of the year, but there\\'s no doubt that it will be a contender.Even with all its shortcomings and sentimental fudges, there is something about McCarthy\\'s refusal to lie down and play the victim that gives it a comic edge. A blunt edge, to be sure, but an edge all the same.[A] sloppily made exercise of rip-offs and redemption.The two have palpable chemsitry, but the film\\'s hyper pace keeps pushing them forward when it might have nicer to just let these two make us laughConsidering that it starts out with two distinctive and likable stars and a reasonably promising premise, \"Identity Thief\" reaches impressive heights of laziness and idiocy.Identity Thief apparently forgets it was supposed to be a comedy.Identity Thief\" is a cheap copy of much better comedies.Great stars can\\'t rescue uneven, sometimes violent comedy.Thanks to McCarthy\\'s abundant comic gifts and those of her equally ill-served straight man Jason Bateman, Identity Thief doesn\\'t leave nearly as icky a taste as it could have, but Gordon only taps into a fraction of his actors\\' potential.Chemistry is the reason things click. Actors with the ability to connect their characters to you always overcome a multitude of movie sins. Laugh out loud funny with bravura performances by Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman and a terrific supporting cast.Identity Thief\" tries its best to entertain but half way through it loses its appeal and you\\'ll be ready for the criminal chase to end.A lot of movies released into theaters deserve the label of \"bad.\" Only a few cross the line into \"reprehensible.\" Say hello to Identity Thief.The film has too many characters, too much sentiment and too much time-wasting side material and phony-baloney \\'motivation,\\' when the only thing it needs is to let McCarthy do her thing. \\'\\'Identity Thief\\'\\' strands these two ordinarily enjoyable comics in the middle of nowhere with no help for miles.Bateman and McCarthy are left stranded onscreen while we are supposed to be chortling at slobber comedy and fat jokes.Vulgar and tawdry, it turns a cyber-crime into cinematic chaos.A self-indulgent comedy catchall, one that\\'s saddled with an irony for a title; that is, for a film about the value of identity, Identity Thief doesn\\'t have a clue about what it wants to be.The whole thing\\'s not much of anything, really - just a little more than an hour-and-a-half of crude jokes and clumsy plotting, all wrapped up with a feel-good ribbon at the end.A few scenes are giggly funny. Some are just stupid.Really, this a two-hander that unfolds at two distinctly separate speeds.We can forgive the silly setup, without which there can be no film, but like many a road movie, this one has a better start and finish than middle.Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy make a terrific comedy team in this road trip romp.McCarthy is a worthy successor to John Candy, who also had a gift for warming up caricatures with loveable humanity.You know Melissa McCarthy has arrived in Hollywood when you see her receive mediocre material like Identity Thief and watch her make it funnier than it deserves to be.The movie\\'s stretch for happy-happy at the end can\\'t wash away the sour taste of all that\\'s come before. Watching \"Identity Thief\" made me feel bad for Jason Bateman.Dismal...Lots of things get stolen in \\'Identity Thief,\\' but the biggest heist is of the hundred minutes you\\'ll lose forever watching it.For a movie that\\'s essentially a gender-scrambled version of Midnight Run, Identity Thief is an amiable rip-off.Identity Thief is a cinematic shart - a huge mess that\\'s no fun to clean up.A manic Melissa McCarthy does her darndest to save this overly familiar comedy. Alas, it isn\\'t enough.\\'Identity Thief\\' gets off to a shaky start and never recovers.Identity Thief elicited one giant shrug from me. Identity Thief is torture porn. We\\'ve been using that term wrong for years.An obnoxious and repulsive comedy that consistently wastes the talents of its two charismatic stars.If you think about it long enough, you\\'ll realize that the movie is asking you to root for a disturbed sociopath who ruins people\\'s lives for sport. Are we having fun yet?A sloppy script from Craig Mazin shows no sense of character, and dragged-out direction from Seth Gordon shows no understanding of comic momentum. For all of its extraneous subplots and contrived scripting [the film\\'s] got one decidedly potent weapon in the form of the fearless dynamo Melissa McCarthy.If only there were some kind of federal bureau that could handle the investigation of such crimes, everything might be resolved easily and quickly.Identity Thief\" is not only not funny. It\\'s negative funny. It\\'s short on laughs, but it will disturb and annoy.Its stars, Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy, steal so many laughs from such improbable places that the bumps in this revenge/road trip farce can be mostly forgiven, though not forgotten.What a bummer.[It] manages to make off with just enough laughs to work, thanks to the wondrous McCarthy, one of the few actresses in Hollywood allowed to showcase her wit and charisma as much as her physique.An unfunny jumble of absurdities.Has the kind of cast that makes audiences ask, \"How bad could it be?\" before proceeding to answer that very question.As is the case with other unsatisfactory diversions, it is entirely possible to ignore the worst parts of this movie, to drift along during the lulls, slide over the half-baked jokes and just wait for Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Bateman to do their things.This often very mean-spirited movie about modern rage plays out with nods to several road-trip classics.The comedy equivalent of mud-wrestling without the mud.Electronic identity theft offers a host of new possibilities, and to have almost none of them explored by writer Craig Mazin and director Seth Gordon in this uninspired trudge of a road movie is the biggest waste of all.The darkness in this comedy is exactly what makes it work so well.At best it\\'s perversely interesting as a major misstep for both stars.Just because there is nothing new under the sun doesn\\'t mean McCarthy can\\'t make hay while it shines.If nothing else, Identity Thief confirms McCarthy\\'s identity in the Hollywood hierarchy: She\\'s a big, ballsy star.Unfunny, predictable, and vulgar, it\\'s the generic equivalent of a Judd Apatow movie. As always, you get what you pay for.\\'Identity Thief\\' is not a great movie. But it is a great vehicle for two terrific actors who drape themselves in material perfectly tailored to them.Identity Thief could be mistaken for the latest Todd Phillips comedy. Whether that\\'s an endorsement or a warning depends on your tastes. It\\'s a comedy that\\'s not really much of a comedy, and it forces the audience to sympathize with a monster of a woman, even while she shows no remorse for her awful crimes.What success the movie finds is due to the leads\\' efforts, which are impressively strenuous. They start out with a great premise, and they\\'re clearly ready to run with it. But most of the laughs are stolen right out from under them.McCarthy, who has been wackily funny in supporting parts, will be the revelation for most of us: Not only can she carry a lead, but she handles heartfelt moments of joy and sorrow.The film\\'s few chuckles can be chalked up to the sheer comedic charisma of McCarthy and Bateman.While \"Identity Thief\" isn\\'t one of the best road-trip movies to come our way, Melissa McCarthy makes the journey worth it.If this is the best we can offer two very fine actors, we\\'re in trouble. As an industry and a culture. In other words, Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman deserve a lot better. And so do we.If \"Identity Thief\" isn\\'t the most outrageous social satire since \"Myra Breckenridge,\" then my name isn\\'t Rex Reed.The result is no classic, but it is fun and it seems to be paving the way for the day when, under the guidance of a smart director, McCarthy knocks one out of the park.A disaster, lurching awkwardly from one tone to another, way too long with too many characters, and seriously short on laughs all the while. As outrageous as the premise may seem, there\\'s enough laughs to make up for the predictable road comedy formula we\\'ve seen so many times before.I did not know I could yawn angrily. This movie somehow proved it possible.Much as I like Melissa McCarthy, this aimless road movie misfires. And when is Hollywood going to let a plus-sized woman be not only sexual but erotic?Ultimately unsatisfying, not as laugh-out-loud funny as it promises to be in the opening.A weak-tea reworking of Midnight Run, itself a long-overvalued action-comedy that was never as good its proponents would have you think.Identity Thief\" is mostly noteworthy for reminding us that McCarthy\\'s talents can, indeed, carry a comedy. It\\'s too bad that it had to be this one.Gordon is lost, and his style of shooting - telescopic close-ups, which never give us enough space to appreciate the performers - feels wrong for comedy.A comedy doesn\\'t necessarily need to develop its characters past caricatures, but a better balance between narrative and yuks tends to make the yuks stronger.They aimed for \"Midnight Run,\" settled for attempting \"Due Date,\" and wound up with \"Guilt Trip.It wants to be \"Midnight Run\" meets \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\" but it carries little of the dramatic heft and real-world semi-plausibility of those much superior efforts.The contrived setup doesn\\'t make much sense, and the movie throws in far too many extraneous antagonists and dead-end plot detours, none of which are entertaining.Asinine [and] illiterate. A cabal of under-sketched narrative interlopers, an uncertain mixture of tones and, most damningly, a general lack of good ideas and jokes doom this strained offering.Melissa McCarthy is riveting in simply-penned moments of remorse and confession, adding tearful depth to her ace timing and formidable physical comedy.Of the many qualities I adore about Melissa McCarthy as a comedian and as a dramatic actor, the best is how fully she gives herself to every character she plays.Another rough comic movie road trip helps give car travel a bad name.With Identity Thief, Melissa McCarthy proves she\\'s got what it takes to carry a feature, however meager the underlying material....a comedy that is about two-thirds worthy of your money and one-third a waste of everybody\\'s time; in other words, better than average for a major studio comedy these days.It\\'s a deserving subject that should be explored in a more viable film, but Identity Thief is so bad it\\'s hard to believe it wasn\\'t directed by Judd Apatow or the Farrelly Brothers.McCarthy gets bashed about like a Stooge, and she bashes back with riotous abandon. Sadly, the rest of the movie is a shambles.It fails as a star vehicle, a recession-era satire, a WTF white-collar-grunt revenge tale, a Midnight Run-style buddy flick, a gross-out laughfest and a bathetic tale of broken souls.nanBreathtakingly, beautifully simple.Whether you consider it a smart thriller or a paint-by-numbers spy caper, The Bourne Identity is a dynamic interpretation of Robert Ludlum\\'s bestselling novel.Violent but thrilling first of the Bourne action trilogy.The Bourne Identity\" is a well-written action spy film that stays true to its espionage thriller genre while inflicting flinch-inducing moments of pure cinematic action.A suspenseful thriller that showcases stunning visuals, great acting and a story that will keep you entertained from start to finish.This is a long sweet breath of fresh air in the action genre...Farfetched plotting nearly capsizes this globe-trotting thriller but director Doug Liman certainly keeps the international intrigue and testosterone flowing at an entertaining clip.A first-rate thriller with grit and intrigue to spare.You may be surprised by the fact that this formula spy thriller has been delivered with a matter-of-fact efficiency that proves highly entertaining.A sleek espionage thriller that reduces the world to the size of a postage stamp. Matt Damon is terrific.The movie is about muscular speed and skill, and that\\'s all it\\'s about. Like its hero, it\\'s blank by design.For once, a sequel would be welcome....Liman is also clever enough to make the real action start when the motor stops.Plenty of very cool fight scenes, edited such that although they are fast-paced, you can actually see what\\'s happening.The Bourne Identity is an intense, violent, bite-your-nails-to-the-quick thriller.One of the many problems, other than Damon\\'s lack of emotion, is the fact that there\\'s no suspense.Also helped immeasurably by an unusually cool score by John Powell, Mr. Liman also makes good use of the European settings, alternating between close ups of Damon\\'s frustrated face and wider pans that slurp up the snow clad France setting....puts the snap, crackle and pop back into the spy thriller.Liman can uncork leap-out-of-your-seat shocks, draw out suspense scenes with malicious finesse and even ease a touch of romance and droll humor into the yarn.The result is an intriguingly paced thriller that knows how to milk some excitement out of smaller scenes.All the style cannot make up for the flagging energy level of the narrative.... With its script problems, it\\'s probably better than it should be ...Typical light summer fare.It\\'s a really safe bet that Damon will be Bourne again.The Bourne Identity is about as effective a thriller as you could want, especially if you don\\'t want to think too hard.I suspect I\\'ll watch this movie over and over. It\\'s simply a blast.Fast, thrilling and everything that James Bond no longer is.Matt Damon proves he\\'s more than up to the task as an action star.\\'A new action hero is Bourne.\\' As incredibly cheesy and precious that advertising tag line for The Bourne Identity is, there\\'s no discounting the truth it does hold.While it never reaches transcendence of its genre, it happens to be pleasurably overstuffed with smart and welcome touches.Matt Damon\\'s an amnesiac secret agent on the run in this immensely satisfying and engagingly direct thriller.In short, The Bourne Identity is an excellent thriller and is well-worth checking out.The movie may not be realistic, but it earns its stripes as high-class escapist fare.The Bourne Identity is a blockbuster without a point... Despite its good-looking veneer, its breakneck pace, its daisy-chain of expert set-pieces, some crucial logic or motive appears to have been junked along the way....a passable effort that receives plenty of mileage out of Damon\\'s expectedly engaging performance...The Bourne Identity delivers everything you ask for in a thriller - nail-biting suspense, awe-inspiring stunts and a resolution as satisfying as the film itself.Spry and alive with possibility [but] also dramatically consequential... the first spy thriller in a good while to successfully marry intentions and deeds.A fast-paced, unpredictable and edgy yarn that breathes new life into the espionage thriller genre.Now, our world is much more complex, the enemies much more gray. Bourne Identity is a clear product of that gray area, but somehow still harkens back to the good old days when a spy was still a spy.The film may be more of a mess than the inside of Bourne\\'s head, but its quirks, strangely enough, are what keep it interesting....great kinetic, silly fun.A rollicking adventure yarn.Aside from turning me away from the CIA, this was a good flick.The Bourne Identity is no mere summer amusement park ride. It\\'s as gray as Go was colorful and a cool contrast to its source material.Damon captures the sense of a good man awakening from a nightmare that turns out to have been his actual life.Twists and turns keep the story increasingly complex and gripping, even if director Liman doesn\\'t really pump up the adrenaline.A well-executed spy-thriller.An edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch.Aspires to be both a whammo action blockbuster and an intelligent think piece...a delicate balance for any film to pull off.Provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue.Great fights. You wouldn\\'t think of Damon as a tough guy, but he\\'s worked really hard on the physical stuff here and it shows.A film that is at best misguided, at worst stubbornly flashy, garbled and ready to file in the drawer labeled \\'instantly forgettable.\\'Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [Jason Bourne].There\\'s rarely a dull moment, but the movie doesn\\'t descend into cartoonish action/violence like most action movies do these days...The film fails to explore more intriguing narrative possibilities regarding the psychological effects of its character\\'s identity crisis.This teaming, including a brilliant and freshly adaptive cast combines for a most engrossing bit of entertainment that maintains tension and credibility throughout.In addition to a clever plot, intrigue, and a car chase or two, Matt Damon manages to pull off being a friendly face that happens to be a highly-trained killer.An above-average and massively entertaining international thriller.The Bourne Identity does not have much in the way of plot or characters, but it is a better-than-average guns, gadgets, and chases in interesting locations movie.An intelligent, well-acted popcorn movie, a little smarter and more sly than most summer offerings.While Bourne\\'s ultimate identity is not as surprising as we might like, enough fun has been generated in the journey itself.Who needs an identity when you\\'re having this much fun?The Bourne Identity is much like a Jackie Chan movie, only with Mr. Matt Damon performing the superman stunts.Liman fails to use his distinct style to dust off this old sky cranker and making Robert Rodriguez look like an indie genius with the Sky Kids series.Even someone with amnesia would recognize the spy-thriller tactics on display here, but at least they\\'re skillfully used.It\\'s a smart, solid, kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn. Nothing overly original, mind you, but solidly entertaining.Really well done.If Liman\\'s ambition is to leave IFC to make big Hollywood entertainment vehicles, then I would suggest he rent the entire Tony Scott library.A great handbook on how to cop ideas from the best spy/ action/ adventure flicksThe action scenes are generally pulse-pounding and gritty; the problem is that they don\\'t build to anything.Liman is a surprisingly good action director, making even the most routine spectacle seem a little more interesting than it probably should beIt moves quickly, adroitly, and without fuss; it doesn\\'t give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the Cold War datedness -- of its premise.I complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again, but The Bourne Identity proves that a fresh take is always possible.Awfully disappointing coming from the director of Swingers and Go.Kudos to director Doug Liman for injecting textbook spy fare with slick intelligence and a truckload of tension.... a savory sip of cognac in a Pabst Blue Ribbon summer of overbaked fantasy franchises and witless popcorn thrillers.The climax lacks the punch and satisfaction it could have delivered in a true clash of the titans.Like its protagonist, it never hands you explanations on a silver platter, and it makes you think a bit, something far too few thrillers do these days.I could sympathize with Damon\\'s character suffering from memory loss, as I too couldn\\'t recall much about this forgettable film soon after seeing it.Nicely paced and fits the bill for those in search of two hours of spy-based action and martial arts.You need more than generic flash, dash and martial-arts moves to make a memorable thriller. Or do you?An engaging action thriller painted against some of Europe\\'s most beautiful locales.A very familiar story, but well craftedAs the genre goes, it can be entertaining, but The Bourne Identity as a whole can\\'t live up to the sum of its parts or its very weak ending.The Bourne Identity is an intriguing and action packed spy thriller. It lacks a big payoff at the end, but is otherwise entertaining.I am giving The Bourne Identity a marginal nod, but if you\\'re looking for a classic-style espionage yarn with complex characters and an engrossing, complicated story, rent Spy Game instead.State of the art Hollywood genre filmmaking: impersonal, efficient and exciting.Does The Bourne Identity hang together as a taut spy thriller? Not completely. But Matt certainly delivers a summer punch.There isn\\'t a dull or dumb moment in this movie.An entertaining thriller that eschews most of the usual spy gimmicks in favour of old-fashioned sleuthing.The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper\\'s agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac, we don\\'t feel much for Damon/Bourne or his predicament.Bourne aspires only to be a fun popcorn movie -- and, for the most part, it is.Its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar, but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and, at the same time, is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time.For the most part, it thankfully succeeds rather well and comes off as an engaging and entertaining entry in the genre.There are moments that feel just on the edge of silly, but that\\'s the idea.The swiftest and sexiest modern thriller since The Thomas Crown Affair.A thriller with some brains and feeling behind it, more attuned to story and character than to spectacle.Like a lot of fast-paced spy films, The Bourne Identity seldom pauses for character development. Fortunately, there\\'s just enough to pull us into the saga, thanks largely to Damon and Potente.The Bourne Identity has all the necessary components of the genre, and deploys them well.The Bourne Identity is always lucid and rarely boring -- after Bad Company, it seems particularly expert.Liman, of Swingers and Go, makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long, low-heat chase, interrupted by a middling car chase.The Bourne Identity isn\\'t a bad movie so much as one that feels like an amateur version of material from more accomplished works.It wouldn\\'t be measurable in g-forces, but there is enough forward motion in The Bourne Identity to pin audiences backwards and enough nervous tension to put them on the edge.A thriller that actually lives up to its trailer.As the intended start of a franchise, The Bourne Identity is a bit of a bust.The film consists mostly of action and romance, two things Liman does well in his comedies, but rather poorly here.The Bourne Identity is a firm foundation for an espionage film franchise that could very well decommission Fleming\\'s Bond or Tom Clancy\\'s Jack Ryan.The Bourne Identity shouldn\\'t be half as entertaining as it is, but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood.Doug Liman has come up with a really fun piece of eye candy and that\\'s as much as one should hope for in a summer shoot\\'em\\'up.Although the exposition effectively invokes cool, the gradual warming trend finally gives this film a resonance beyond immediate impact.If The Bourne Identity is an example of indie-movie rogue agents gone amok, then mainstream Hollywood should definitely recruit a few more.Overall, Liman has done a good job of making this old Cold War thriller seem born again.The Bourne Identity crackles with equal measures of efficiency and energy.As a psychological study of secret agents, The Bourne Identity is too much carnival ride and not enough John le Carre.The Bourne Identity, starring Matt Damon, is a blast from the past dressed up as current-day fare. But this retro thriller still packs a powerful punch.Identity is one of those rare thrillers where the cops aren\\'t fools, villains don\\'t turn stupid at crucial moments, and career assassins seldom miss targets.For all its shoot-outs, fistfights, and car chases, this movie is a phlegmatic bore, so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck, seem downright Hitchcockian.As if trying to grab a lump of Play-Doh, the harder that Liman tries to squeeze his story, the more details slip out between his fingers.Some say this movie lacks character development...but I\\'d like to know exactly how you develop a character who doesn\\'t know who he is.With his stilted performance, Damon manages to make Bourne about the dullest spy who ever lived.The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups.Not nearly so serious or smug as most spy movies, it affects and celebrates a kind of offbeatness that\\'s rare in the genre.Even without web shooters or a light saber, Damon comes out as one of the good guys of summer.Liman adds some brash, and occasionally subtle, touches to the spy-on-the-run formula, without ever quite managing to transcend the cliches.Though it\\'s clearly meant to be character-driven, the movie is thrown out of whack by a total lack of chemistry between the leads, and some great acting on the side.Laced with great shock moments, Bourne moves along smartly on its own steam, drawing us confidently into its orbit.As much as I adore the Bond franchise, I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever been as giddy over one of those films as I am with The Bourne Identity.Free from the encumbrances of history and of Ludlum\\'s cloddish prose, The Bourne Identity, like its hero, triumphs through sheer unreflective professionalism.Doug Liman, the director of Bourne, directs the traffic well, gets a nice wintry look from his locations, absorbs us with the movie\\'s spycraft and uses Damon\\'s ability to be focused and sincere.Anyone familiar with the better work of Damon or director Doug Liman will see their jacked-up expectations shot down.Sets medium-range goals for itself, and nails them solidly.The meandering and sloppy finale only makes it even more ironically forgettable.There\\'s a new action hero in town, and I\\'m sorry Yoda, but he isn\\'t a CGI midget with bad hygiene and Miss Piggy\\'s voice.Confirms that espionage can be compelling without being sexy, even with Matt Damon in the starring role.A captivating spy thriller well worth the ticket price.A composition of gestures stripped of romance and presented in their barest forms.The screenplay never lets us forget that Bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . There is never really a true \"us\" versus \"them\".The Bourne Identity\" creates its own new coherence of indie arthouse and commercial thriller. I\\'ve seen the best cloak-and-danger exercises, including The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and the original Day of the Jackal, and in terms of story and cold-sweat suspense, I\\'d rank this one right up there.Even if the new Bourne Identity doesn\\'t stick to the letter of his work, the late, great Ludlum would still appreciate this ripping yarn if he saw it.A transcendent summer movie: It assumes, for two hours, you\\'ve brain and heart enough to stick with a film that doesn\\'t condescend, doesn\\'t beat you up and doesn\\'t dumb you to death.A throwback to all that made movies like this exciting in the first place, a film where the action, though highly alluring, remains less important than the mystery at hand.An impeccable Hollywood thriller.The film\\'s greatest asset is how much it\\'s not just another connect-the-dots, spy-on-the-run picture.Exciting and engrossing...doesn\\'t attempt anything innovative, but it succeeds by doing the tried and true very effectively.The film\\'s overall upbeat tempo and eventful complications made for an entertaining watch.A close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late.My main concern upon hearing of this project was: will I believe that Matt Damon could kill me with a business card at fifty yards? Fortunately the answer is a resounding yes....with \"The Bourne Identity\" we return to the more traditional action genre.The slickest, coolest assassin flick since \"The Professional.A taut, fast-action thriller, but Matt Damon just doesn\\'t cut it as a spy.There\\'s nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like The Bourne Identity that\\'s packed with just as much intelligence as action.It has the reeled-in pyrotechnics and the muted pacing of an intelligent spy film, but it doesn\\'t have the smarts of one.A completely satisfying thriller that will keep your brain engaged and your adrenaline pumping.old-fashioned in the best sense of the term, an espionage tale that rejects the gaudiness and glamor of the recent James Bond epics and concentrates instead on a fairly straightforward manhunt mystery.Liman does such a superb job with the pacing of the film that you almost forget about how little substance there is.A beneficiary of lowered standards, the film may be a bloodless piece of thriller craftsmanship, but at a time when craft has become a negligible quality, its streamlined efficiency and whipcrack timing are increasingly uncommon virtues.While there\\'s never a dull moment, the film, derived from a Robert Ludlum novel, is too mechanical and plot-driven to veer very far into character.It may not work as a full-fledged spy thriller or as an identity crisis pot boiler yet, thanks to Liman\\'s near effortless direction, the genre gumbo is top notch nonetheless.What is exciting prose on the printed page becomes merely prosaic on the big screen.In these dog days, Bourne earns what passes as high praise: It doesn\\'t suck.The Bourne Identity is a quality film that works and it fulfills many of the cinematic wishes that critics and audiences regularly complain are not being fulfilled by studio films.SNEAK REVIEW: I was very disapointed with the rough cut. It unfortunately succumbed to the demise of many movie problems, too many plot holes and unanswered questions.A strictly-for-the-kiddies, enjoy-it-in-the-moment, forget-it-when-it\\'s-over popcorn flick. What makes it such a disappointment is that \"The World\\'s Greatest Comics Magazine\" deserved better.Aided by largely credible special effects, the four stars of Fantastic Four manage to make their movie worth seeing and give us reason to be optimistic for a more cohesive sequel.Fantastic Four is anything but, and should serve as an indication that maybe its time to put the brakes on the current avalanche of comic book adaptations.Lee and Kirby built Marvel Comics on the foundation of the FF and it\\'s no stretch to say this franchise could still be going strong a decade later with a better opening act. Fantastic Four is terribly miscast. It\\'s poorly written, visually uninteresting, and worst of all, boring. The film drags considerably. There are huge gaps without any action and it brings the pacing to an unbearable crawl.Fantastic Four is actually very true to its source material - often literally so - but generally misses the spirit entirely.Some comics just shouldn\\'t be turned in to movies...The film is made in the internet equivalent of capital letters and its simplistic morality stands out on the big screen more so than on the small page.An opportunity squandered by Marvel, which really needs to watch its quality control more closely.Four-play without any climax.The film is affable enough, though nothing much seems to be at stake.After the recent crop of enjoyable superhero movies, this is just an embarassment.A better than average comic book effort.Tim Story gives the Marvel comics superheroes the Barbershop treatment.Shows how filmmaking through market research, screenwriting by committee, and over-dependence on moviemaking technology can result in huge, colourful, loud but totally vacuous and heartless movies.Marvel Comics continues to empty out its stable of superheroes with this entertaining tale.full review in GreekNot all comic-book films have to be as weighty and angst-filled as a graphic novel. Fantastic Four is neither fantastic nor incredible, but it\\'s entertaining nonetheless.Fantastic it most certainly ain\\'t....there is little sense of wonder or excitement in Fantastic Four. It is merely a middling contender among a surplus of superhero movies.When the playboy, joke-around character is the best part of the film, you know you have problems.Not all that exciting to watch, let me tell you.A garish mediocrity.Never goes deeper than the ink on a comic bookIf the equally naive Superman were released today, would it receive a similarly cold reception?[A]part from some undeniably slick effects ... the wow factor in this movie is surprisingly minute ... [O]nly Julian McMahon\\'s nefarious psycho, Dr. Doom, shows real promise here.Director Tim Story manages to give it no character whatever, with the casting making things worse.Let\\'s hope the follow-ups turn out to be better -- they could hardly be worse.Not a great film but a good opening chapter... a film about a superhero family that\\'s actually a family-friendly superhero film.The FF are unpretentious and nerdy and they bicker with each other, giving the film a loose, buoyant quality in between action sequences.No disgrace, but it\\'s far from a classic either.It puts a smile on your face and you can\\'t resist the charming nature of the film.The only story you\\'ll find in Fantastic Four is the one attached to the last name of its director.The protagonists of this film certainly deserved a better fate.Fantastic Four is a popcorn movie that delivers a fluffy, buttery treatAfter this lackluster outing, the thought of a sequel is a stretch even Mr. Fantastic might not be able to make.A fantastic bore.A Fantastic Bore. Foursome marred by lousy writing and directingThe result is hardly fantastic, but it is quite a lot of fun.Tim Story -- who, based on his previous work in the small-scale Barbershop and the painfully poor Taxi, was clearly the wrong man for this job.On its own terms, Fantastic Four is a pretty lousy movie, but it looks even worse coming on the heels of so many recent first-rate comic book adaptations.With a sort of backdoor approach to superherodom, another comic strip from the minds of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby hits the celluloid.A fairly dull, thoroughly mediocre adventure--hardly the cinematic treatment Marvel\\'s first family deserves.Ten years in the making, and this is all we get?Tim Story\\'s screen adaptation of the Marvel comic is cheesy in production values; it\\'s the clash of personalities that makes the film in any way fantastic.The feature is neither disappointing, nor memorable. It is just average, which is something a superhero or band of heroes cannot be.An obnoxious movie in which potential adventure is sideswiped in favor of watery characters and dialogue that feels like it was lifted from five or six reality shows.Fantastic Four functions at the level of a below average Saturday-morning cartoon.There are four different movies in The Fantastic Four struggling to get out....another comic book movie with a lot of special effects. ...a complete waste of time. Too insipid to live.Despite a good cast, this is a badly made film that only barely works as brainless filler.It\\'s not particularly fantastic, but Fantastic Four is passable summer popcorn fare.Unlike most recent comic-book adaptations, Fantastic Four doesn\\'t think it\\'s about anything. In fact, it\\'s doubtful that the film thinks, period. Superheroes are only as good as the supervillain, so let\\'s get these forces clashing early on and often.If exposure to cosmic rays made all women look like Jessica Alba, then every Lifetime movie should glow green. Fantastic Four is left passing off dopey comedy and performances as playfulness.Weighted down with a turgid story and utterly middling special effects, The Fantastic Four isn\\'t likely to be Stan Lee\\'s favorite of the nearly dozen Marvel Comics adaptations either out already or on their way.If I were to put the same amount of effort into my review that the folks behind Fantastic Four expended trying to entertain you, the rest of this page would be blank.Before the inevitable and surprisingly anticlimactic battle with Doom, we are treated to two extreme-sports demonstrations, several training montages, [and] an ill-advised love triangle.We know what comic book movies are capable of being. They can have greatness in them. Fantastic Four has nothing more than okay-ness.Fantastic Four is a special-effects extravaganza, but its plot is mired in issues that only schoolboys care about.After such recent downers as \\'War of the Worlds\\' and \\'Dark Water,\\' this campy film version of Marvel\\'s longest-running comic book series is a breath of fresh air.Now, I\\'m not saying director Tim Story was the wrong choice but when the only two things of note on your resume are the moderately amusing Barbershop and the horrendous Taxi there just has to be a better way to go.A lousy excuse for a big-budget action film. The perfect summertime movie. Munch your popcorn and let your senses absorb all the fantastic fun.Bland performances throughout. And really, who wants to make Jessica Alba the invisible girl? What a bad idea. I want her to be visible at all times.A lack of pretense shouldn\\'t mean a lack of wit or excitement...Far less than fantastic.One wonders if an added character named Sleeperman would consider joining the crew because then this simplistic sci-fi dud could have been dubbed as Fantastic SnoreIt\\'s kind of incredible how little happens in this movie.Metza-metza. The FF is just not that fantastic t\\'all...As Marvel comics fans already know, being zapped by a radioactive cloud in outer space alters your DNA according to your sense of self.Lacking any coherent vision, of all the recent movies derived from comic books, this is among the weakest.It\\'s certainly an adequate summer popcorn movie.Chiklis breathes fresh life into perhaps the silliest comic book character adapted for the big screen with a genuine humanity that can be felt even through the bulky foam costume.The best of the comic book movies in recent years have demonstrated that thrills and spectacle don\\'t have to be strangers to wit and grace.Reducing a summer blockbuster to the scale of a primetime sitcom is novel, but it isn\\'t admirable.The key to the success of Marvel Comics adaptations is that even as the characters have fantastic powers, they remain ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.Michael Chiklis won\\'t have to put on that uncomfortable Thing outfit again.A fun, fast and fantastically performed movie, and a pretty good interpretation of the comicIt might help if Alba could act, though I doubt her horny legion of fans will complain.[L]ike a kiddie ride when I\\'ve been primed to expect the biggest, baddest, meanest emotional-roller coaster of a sexy action movie when it\\'s all about guys in tights....begins to feel like it comes from the one comic book even a comic-book geek would be embarrassed to be caught reading.It exists largely to entertain and delight, which used to be precisely what summer blockbusters were engineered to do.As total packaging, you can\\'t deny that this show is handsomely wrapped.It\\'s done with an agreeable confidence and flair, the actors all fit comfortably in their roles and the effects are fun.Fantastic Four falters most in its cynical approach. Obviously gearing for a sequel, the movie goes heavy on development and light on action.If there was ever any doubt that action scenes depend more on context than flash, Fantastic Four proves it.Right from the start the movie smells like a stinker because of its Z-grade casting. Worst of all is Julian McMahon, overacting as a Kevin Spacy-ish Dr. Doom.Not the best movie of the summer, but it may the best accompaniment to popcorn.Devotes as much time to a creaky love triangle as it does exploring the fantastic powers of its foursome. And that begs the question: Who goes to a movie like this looking for what is essentially a bad episode of Dawson\\'s Creek?A human rubber band, a transparent woman, a guy on fire, a walking rock pile, and a guy named Doom seem perfectly plausible in the funny books.On the big screen, not so much.Even if you can get past the acting -- and in the case of the beautiful, blank Alba, that\\'s asking a lot -- the film just sits there, not exactly torturous, but never very exciting, either.How about The Okay Quartet?The Fantastic Four get treated reverently, but not seriously, in this modified retelling of the story, but then it\\'s hard to take any one seriously who goes to work for Dr. Victor Von Doom and Doom Industries.When the Four finally use their different powers together to fight Doctor Doom, it\\'s enough to get you past the torpor of Origin Movie Syndrome and make you hope for a sequel that gets right down to business.Superheroes\\' origin stories are inherently background-heavy, but director Tim Story and screenwriters Simon Kinberg, Michael France and Mark Frost spend too much time on setup.A funky, fun film version of the famous Marvel superhero concoction.A wildly uneven, sporadically slapdash action-adventure that amuses in fits and starts.Fantastic it ain\\'t, but not bad it sort of is.It\\'s better than the Roger Corman version, but that\\'s not saying much.The film generates little tension or excitement, dawdling its way towards the climactic showdown between the heroes and the villain, Doctor Doom.A movie that never delivers on its premise; a movie that takes promising character dynamics and gullet-stuffs them with idiot dialogue; a movie that will alienate all but the wee and easily impressed with its frequent lurches into stupidity.A popcorn popper, a cinematic sugar buzz. And blessedly so.The comic book adventure is a fun, escapist change of pace from all the politically weighted popcorn fare on the scene this season....too bouncy to be an Elektra bummer, but should make Marvel mascot Stan Lee think twice about burning another lucrative bridge with unintentional hilarity.A perfect storm of wooden acting, hackneyed direction, inane scripting and laughably cartoonish special effects produces a shapeless mess more wearyingly stupid than arch-villian Dr. Doom is evil.You don\\'t expect realism from a comic-book movie, but you do want the characters to seem larger than life. Here, they look like contestants at a costume party.By being late to the multiplex marketplace, the film version offers little we haven\\'t seen done before and done better.Not a bad movie, but it is a film likely to alienate the fan base of the comic book on which it is based.[The writers are] so busy setting up the premise that they barely get around to exploiting it.Story can\\'t infuse this juvenile hunk of entertainment with either the wit or the savvy to make it seem like anything more than an overblown version of Saturday- morning TV.The kind of don\\'t-ask- too-many-questions action-hero movie where the humor is tasty and the FX are wicked-cool.A film that\\'s nowhere near as fantastic as it should be. Something\\'s missing. And that something is most likely a strong director.A not-so-bad mindless bit of camp escapism that doesn\\'t try to eclipse its dime-store comic book roots.It\\'s sporadically entertaining but never amounts to more than Mediocre Four.A bad superhero comedy that takes its time going nowhere.Their trip into space may be another small step for man, but it\\'s a giant leap backward for the comic-book-turned-action-movie genre.Can be fun if your expectations are low enough.I guess \"Commonplace Four\" or \"Tedious Four\" didn\\'t have the same ring to it.Fantastic Four Never Strives to be \"Fantastic.\" It Works As A Human Story and succeeds due to dimished expectations set by a horrible marketing campaign.Fantastic Four is anything but, and should serve as an indication that maybe its time to put the brakes on the current avalanche of comic book adaptations.Its plot is stretched thin. Its creativity is nearly invisible. Its logic is rocky. And the whole enterprise goes up in flames.A more accurate title would have been \"The Fantastic Two and the Other Two, Not So Much.There was nothing that I could point to and say, \"That was stupid.\" Considering the atomic wasteland of superhero properties committed to film, that\\'s saying a lot.about as dynamic as Teddy Ruxpin... in its willingness to go for cheap jokes and awful Schwarzenegger-style wisecracks, \\'Fantastic\\' is reminiscent of \\'Batman and Robin\\'...A colorful, young-skewing flick... but one as hopelessly bland as it is behind the times.The new Fantastic Four might have been palatable if we hadn\\'t already met a certain wall crawler or Caped Crusader on screen.Fantastic Four is what it is, and I\\'m okay with what it is.The good news is that this Fantastic Four film manages to capture a lot of what made the comics appealing. The bad news is that the final product isn\\'t quite as good as it could have been.The film is entertaining and moves along at a good clip, but when you reach the anticlimactic ending, you realize that nothing really happened, and that for every cool scene there was a badly directed one.Very smooth, if overly familiar.In trying to nail just the right mix of comic book action, comedy and pathos, the movie emerges as a tone-deaf mishmash of underdeveloped characters, half-baked humor and unhatched plotting drenched in CGI overkill.Had the filmmakers deliberately set out to insult, demean, and trample upon Lee and Kirby\\'s legacy, they could hardly have done a more efficient job.So much...is bungled with inept storytelling and watered-down dialogue, and Story is so powerless to right the course, that Fantastic Four winds up more dopey than fun.All-talk, no-action superhero flick is a dull, drab mess of shallow plots, dull characters and bland effects.Everything about it bears the stench of amateurs, from the unspectacular special effects to the sitcom-lame dialogue to the butchered storyline.No doubt Roger Corman\\'s version was worse, but it was probably more entertaining.The most endearing terms I might come up with for this film are \\'dorky\\' and \\'cute,\\' but \\'cute\\' is never what a superhero movie aspires to be.A painful, sluggish black hole of simultaneous bad ideas and no ideas at all.A not-great movie made slightly better by the addition of some extra character development and breathing room, the Fantastic Four Extended Edition is a must-own for fans of the original comic book.The happiest comic book movie on earth... By now the only way to give us something different is to show people who enjoy being superheroes.Meet Mr. Mediocrity, the Human Kindling, the Obscure Woman and Whatchamacallit. They form the Mediocre Four and boast the power to slightly entertain and somewhat enthrall.Almost fantastically bad.Poor Ben Grimm suffers the most tragic fate. He is transformed from the charismatic, brilliant actor Michael Chiklis into a giant prosthetic goofy suit that fools no one.Aficionados of the comic book will cringe... but hey, it\\'s a fun popcorn flick.Oh yes, it\\'s Catwoman bad.Low indeed have Marvel\\'s fortunes sunk when this is the best they can send against their archrival\\'s superior Batman Begins.Whole chunks of necessary explanation feel like they\\'ve been left on the cutting room floorPotential audiences would be better entertained by reading all the reviews to see how many synonyms can be used for the word \"bad.\" And it would be much cheaper, too.An overinflated B-movie with no grace, no subtext, no wit, and featuring beefcake/cheesecake actors who look like they\\'ve been plucked from the soaps.There\\'s nothing terribly fantastic about this ho-hum futuristic foray.\\'Fantastic Four\\' could have been hot, but in the hands of some studio blockheads, the premise is stretched so thin that it disappears.Rarely terrible, let alone memorable, it\\'s a brutally average piece of disposable summer entertainment that fades from the mind like some hazy, half-sleeping dream.More superhero sitcom than comic book adventure, the movie lacks a strong, dramatic through-line.If you want to see how members of a family that\\'s fraught with discord and dysfunction learn about teamwork and the nature of kin -- and dispatch bad guys in the process -- rent The Incredibles.Compared with the psychological probing and spiritual brooding of Batman Begins, Fantastic Four is proudly dumb, loud and inconsequential.The radiation-altered members of the Fantastic Four don\\'t show their humanity. Rather, the superpowered quartet is little more than a bland collection of four-color caricatures.The whole thing lacks oomph and identity.It certainly looks stunning, and there\\'s even a try at injecting some human drama and strong emotion into the action stew.It\\'s fun to watch superheroes who aren\\'t quite at ease with their abilities, but The Incredibles -- last year\\'s similarly themed animated film -- is livelier and funnier.You can feel the flopsweat of the screenwriters, laboring to make their jokes work and their scenes interesting.What could have been the brilliant set-up to an ongoing franchise is instead turned into a vacuous slice of summer escapism.It\\'s hard to tell if the other actors are awful or if it\\'s the script.Could have been dumb fun...unfortunately, the filmmakers succeed in getting only the dumb part right, omitting the fun entirely.At their best, the results have a comic zip that the X-Men pictures have largely lacked.Take the movie on its own lighthearted terms and, chances are, you\\'ll be taken in.Sad, then, to see that the Marvel rag that elevated the human element in the pow-biff-bam of the superhero world has been transposed into the most plastic of comic-to-movie adaptations yet.Fantastic Four is essentially campy fun; this is the sort of movie Schumacher\\'s Batman and Robin was trying to be.Fantastic Four isn\\'t even close to Sin City, Batman Begins or even Constantine, but it\\'s a relatively quick, vibrant, focused origin story. So bad it takes points away from BATMAN BEGINS.Fantastic FlopThis movie is more like a B-grade comic book adaptation than the A-list production it should have been.Fantastic Four, for all of its super effects and glossy finish, is a hollow movie experience.A wasted opportunity to breathe fresh life into the Marvel universe\\'s long-stodgy elder statesmen. Yes, it\\'s kinda stupid, but it\\'s basically fun.A movie about depressed superheroes trying to become unsuper is as boring as it sounds.Fantastic Four is a movie that could have been a lot better - but it could also have been a lot worse.Who are these half-wit Hollywood clowns that keep hiring cleavage-candy actresses with no measurable talent to play laughably bespectacled scientists in action movies?How fascinating that a film about super-humans was made by a collection of sub-humans; what a topsy-turvy world in which we live.none of it\\'s any more impressive than the stuff you can find in your average video game.Sometimes the Hollywood treatment can be a superhero\\'s greatest arch-nemesis.nannannannanSeinfeld\\'s dry delivery makes for a certain adult sensibility, but even the horde of celebrity cameos can\\'t really lift the story off the ground.Here\\'s the final buzz: Bee Movie deserves to be queen bee at the box office.Its moral that even the smallest creature can make a world of difference is one to be appreciated. It is a shame, however, that it could not keep up its energetic and fun pace established within its first act. The hyperactive comic randomness is deadeningA consistently amusing bit of animated whimsy from funnyman Jerry Seinfeld that has the observational comic\\'s fingerprints all over it.Has there ever been an uglier animated feature? The eerie, fever-dream-like faux three-dimensionality, the cyborg-like humanoids, the septic, etiolated colors.Personally, I think I liked \"nothing\" better.... may not be \"about nothing,\" but it is not about much more than the puny pun in the title....tries mightily to be cute and cuddly, and in this regard it succeeds...at least for kids.Seinfeld\\'s pleasingly idiosyncratic comic voice comes through in the haphazard, slaphappy storyline. [Blu-Ray][T]his comedy provides sporadic chuckles but, you\\'ll pardon the expression, drones on for much of its running time.Bland, watered-down Seinfeld-ian humor for kids, amusing at best, grating at worst.Relentlessly uneven yet basically entertaining...Without a particularly strong storyline and loaded with only modestly enjoyable gags, it putts along like a familiar old jalopy, reasonably likeable if eminently forgettable.Bee Movie is a solid mix of comforting gags, clever language and a meandering plot that doesn\\'t seem to have enough gas to stretch out into a full feature.Bee-boundaries are so last-year and fans are likely to understand it in Seinfeldian-hysterical terms. To the rest of us it\\'s an overstretched been-there, seen-that concept.Decade-old leftovers reaching for laughs.I can\\'t believe I\\'m going to say it, but this film is as busy as a bee.Dreamworks Animation is not Pixar, no matter how hard it tries. Dreamworks\\' animated films lack the sort of effortless charm, animated grace and satirical wit that Pixar seems to generate instinctively.Bee Movie is a light, moderately entertaining romp. Not that there\\'s anything wrong with that.What distinguishes this better than half-decent comedy is its detailed insight into the bee brainSeinfeld the professional cynic has become Seinfeld the environmental crusader. Who\\'d have thunk it?Bee sure to see this.This curiously flat animated comedy simply doesn\\'t have the sparkle one expects from a Jerry Seinfeld project.Cleverly acted and beautifully rendered, \"Bee Movie\" is another animated triumph from the studio that brought us \"Shrek.Amusing and likeable, but scarcely memorable.The best we can award is bee minus.What a treat to see a comedy that starts funny, is funny in the middle, and ends funny - unlike the usual Hollywood model in which all the humour is used up in the first act setting up the premise, and then winds down into sentimentality.Sadly the animation fails to bee-dazzle - often looking a bit flat. Overall, it has to be a Bee-plus.This DreamWorks film is not the sliced-bread marvel it has spent an enormous amount of money pretending to be. But it must be said that Seinfeld\\'s script is a thing of wonder.The animation is fine, the plot accessible enough for youngsters and it clocks in at a snappy hour and a half.Bright, sunny and almost instantly forgettable, even Jerry Seinfeld can\\'t stop Bee Movie from boldly going where far too many CGI animations have gone before.Whatever happened to no hugs, no learning? It\\'s enough to bring you out in hives.Passes the time, but undoutedly one for the little \\'uns.Bee Movie has its moments but all in all there is very little sting in its tale.The depth of talent in the cast and gag writing shines through, but it\\'s only just enough to take your mind off of the flat animation.Amusing comedy with likeable characters, colourful animation and several great gags, though the script isn\\'t as focussed as it should have been.What Bee Movie really lacks is a compelling hero. Seinfeld is essentially playing himself, so what we get is a stand-up comedian in a black and yellow sweater.great funI was thoroughly entertained in this lively burst of nonsense that has little agenda except to amuseSmarter than it is funny with delicious design.Enjoyable fun even if it\\'s not particularly original.Bee Movie\" has a little bit of something for everyone. It\\'s loaded with action and sight gags for the kids and enough adult humor to keep the grownups happy.While most animated features, even the bad ones, champion individuality, Bee Movie flies in the opposite direction by rallying around the notions of conformity and subservience.The weak storyline hovers over a scene while foraging for material and then flits off to a new situation. Without a strong narrative, the movie tends to drone on.It\\'s impersonal. It doesn\\'t come from anywhere interesting.Will small children even care about what bees do? All they care about is not getting stung.A friendly, joke-stuffed animated feature.A desperate, unfocused collection of bits and schtick that sends you out of the theater exhausted and unsatisfied.As its potential trans-species romance can never be consummated, the movie turns instead into a peculiarly balanced relationship comprised of financial and legal accord.Maybe it would have been better for Seinfeld to make an animated movie about nothing.Seinfeld, what happened? You\\'ve gone soft on us. Sure, some of it is fun but where\\'s the sting?Bee Movie is never an unpleasant experience, but it\\'s never a particularly engaging or funny film either.Seinfeld\\'s sardonic wit is as sharp and irresistible as ever...The big monster in this movie isn\\'t the human race, but those humans who failed to make a compelling film.A giddy, freewheeling, clever, delightful animated romp \\'about nothing,\\' a thing onto itself, the very definition of existential phenomenon.Seinfeld\\'s quick wit and glib personality are strong enough to give the scattershot story an illusion of coherence.Compare this to the output of a studio like Pixar, and the movie really fits its title: a second-rate computer-animated comedy.Too confusing to be humorous.Rock has but two scenes in the film, but he needs a hundred more. Give the man his own movie, please, if only because it\\'d bee far better than this one.This is a beautifully animated, cleverly executed, warm and funny adventure.Beyond its basic concept, Bee Movie hasn\\'t the first idea where to go.Regardless of its PG rating, if you are a fan of Jerry Seinfeld\\'s comedy style, then you will probably find a lot to like here. This is an incredibly witty film.A spelling bee. A busy bee. A killer bee. But a Seinfeld bee? Sorry Jerry, your hapless honey-seeking hero doesn\\'t create much of an animated buzz.I liked Bee Movie because it was cute, funny, family-friendly, and mercifully brief.There will be more gags and puns in the reviews of press pundits than could be found in the entirety of this film, which fails to create a bee world of any logic or surprise.Seinfeld\\'s droll, witty observations add to the adult appeal of \\'Bee Movie,\\' and youngsters will probably enjoy its eye-popping colors.All in all, Bee Movie\\'s large team of writers and directors scrape together enough for kids to enjoy, but kids these days have come to expect more than just \"enough\" from their animated movies.Harmless fun for the whole family.A snazzy-looking mixed bag. Kids will be diverted, adults will tolerate it, and all involved will be expecting something more imaginative than what Jerry Seinfeld has whittled together.It\\'s still the Dreamworks model of big, recognizable voices playing their personas, but this time it\\'s an actual movie too. They wait a while to unload all the major pop culture references.Bee Movie is fun, if not formulaic in its humor and story approach. The writers threw in every ... bee joke and situation you could think of, yet the movie still works.This well-meaning but comically limp offering from DreamWorks Animation inspires boredom more than anything.Bee Movie is a cute movie. Not that there\\'s anything ... well, you know the rest. But cute is not what adults expect from Jerry Seinfeld, although children will be delighted.Bee Movie doesn\\'t touch the bar raised so high by Pixar, but it creates a little buzz of its own.Bee Movie has a few charming moments and a scene or two with legitimate hilarity, but mostly it\\'s just mediocre.Some humor in Bee Movie is too sophisticated for little kids, but there are enough dazzling action scenes to compensate. Youngsters won\\'t get an allusion to The Graduate, but they\\'ll enjoy the slapstick that follows.The film is undistinguished visually. Worse, it isn\\'t especially funny.What I like about Bee Movie is its comfy, off-the-cuff charm: unlike a lot of animated family entertainment, it\\'s not all Thwack Smash Kaboom.The movie has some pretty pictures and a few good jokes, but not nearly enough. And the story suffers from sitcom attention-deficit disorder, veering off in a new direction every half-hour or so.Watching this pun-filled cartoon is like falling into a tray of children\\'s watercolors -- the warm end, where oranges and yellows and ambers wave.A surprisingly unfunny, belabored and unimaginative comedy, Bee Movie is a huge disappointment considering the extent of Seinfeld\\'s participation.Nothing about the movie resonates emotionally.Jerry Seinfeld\\'s comic sensibility enlivens this tale of a bee who wants to fly by the seat of his pants.Seinfeld doesn\\'t need to go back to his \\'show about nothing\\' premise, but here\\'s hoping his next project can be about just a little less.A kid film with not enough going on.Is it as bold as it might be? Does it blaze with invention? Is it the best babbling-bee urban biopic, bar none? Just about.Everybody\\'s least favorite hive workers get an anthropomorphic makeover, courtesy of Jerry Seinfeld, in this animated flick that\\'s got some stinging wit but a story that\\'s strictly for the birds.It leaves no unpleasant aftertaste. If you take impressionable kids, you should be prepared to explain two things: No, bees and humans do not normally live happily ever after; and yes, bees sometimes just sting you for the hell of it.The film\\'s charm, quickness and design carry the day.A welcome diversion from DreamWorks Animation\\'s increasingly trying Shrek series.The vibe is loose-limbed and fluky, and the gags have an extra snap that\\'s recognizably Seinfeldian. If I believed in a sitcom afterlife, I\\'d swear the whole thing was cooked up by Kramer and George\\'s dad.Genuine silliness is so rare a quality these days that it shouldn\\'t go undervalued, even in a sweet little nothing of a picture like Bee Movie.The whole thing\\'s pretty cute and breezy.All of this material, written by Seinfeld and writers associated with his television series, tries hard, but never really takes off.What a pleasure. After a cackle of serious dramas and actual letter grade B movies, this silly insect film was just the ticket to put a little honey in my tea.An agreeable though tame animated picture that more than does the trick but is unlikely to become a super buzz flick.I got antsy in the bee movie.Indeed, Bee Moive is full of half-thought-through notions. Much is at first made of Barry\\'s \"romance\" with a human, voiced by Renee Zellweger, but any potential problems in the friendship are dropped without discussion midway through.Not only are the bees nonsensical, so is the plot, even grading on the fantasy curve.Jerry Seinfeld\\'s disappointing labor of animated-movie love is more of a lukewarm handholding experience than a full embrace.This movie literally just sits there going from scene to scene with a lackadaisical whimsy that, after a while, becomes a bit tedious.Seinfeld\\'s animated feature flies a little too fast to leave a lasting impression.Call it the curse of high expectations but with Jerry Seinfeld involved, laughs should flow like honey but they don\\'t - unless you\\'re really into bee puns.Bee Movie will make you think twice before swatting one of the yellow and black guys next time you\\'re being buzzed.Here\\'s the biggest problem most folks will have with Bee Movie: It\\'s not Ratatouille.One of the better animated films of the year, an enjoyable and consistently clever ride courtesy of the very original comic viewpoint of the man who made arguably the best sitcom of all time.Kids should get a kick out of it, but anyone craving Seinfeld\\'s usual brand of funny business will have to stick to TV reruns.While never as clever as it thinks it is, and lacking the internal logic that makes a Pixar project hum with indescribable brilliance, Bee Movie is still a witty, imaginative romp.Unless your idea of wit is an unrelenting stream of groan-inducing insect puns, \"Bee Movie\" offers little more than buzzkill.Another ground-breaking show about nothing -- a hornet\\'s nest of hype for a fat hive of nothing.Not nearly as funny, clever or witty as one would have hoped.It has enough buzzing wit and eye-popping animation to win over the kids -- and probably more than a few parents, too.Certainly Bee Movie could\\'ve been smarter, faster, and far cleverer, and it\\'s disappointing to watch Seinfeld settle for less. For a man who made a mint reveling in comedic risk on a weekly basis, his first movie lacks serious sting.Begins warily as a mild chucker and then reveals itself to be an increasingly clever and very funny appreciation of a bee\\'s existence.Instead of gently skewering the conventions of contemporary animation, it simply follows them to a TBet you\\'re just itching to see \"Bee Movie.\"This little honey was launched with an ad campaign possibly equal to the cost of launching a space shuttle ... bees have been everywhere.made for kids with more bee puns than Carrot Top and Kenny Bania could ever imagineBee Movie isn\\'t a B movie, it\\'s a Z movie, as in dizmal.Bee Movie is certainly not low-budget, but it has all the staying power and creative value of a B-movie. The secret life of bees, as told by Seinfeld, is a bore with a capital B.The most genuinely apian aspect of Bee Movie is that it spends a lot of its running time buzzing happily around, sniffing out fresh jokes wherever they may bloom.Jerry Seinfeld returns to the mainstream spotlight with Bee Movie, which proves as awkward and ineffective as George Costanza\\'s attempts to wear a toupee.Mostly amusing and good-natured, occasionally hysterical, and actually manages to sneak in a subtle lesson about nature.It\\'s not worth seeing, but if all the hype has you expecting a classic, you should lower your expectations.Seinfeld\\'s observational humor is relegated to the edges of a lightweight story.The riskiest move Seinfeld made was to create an unlikable protagonist who is wrong every step of the way, but treat him like a hero.Never funny, never meaningful, never coherent, never animated.It\\'s a minor film. It\\'ll be amusing once and then forgotten.If it\\'s not Toy Story, well, what is? But Bee Movie offers plenty of entertainment for all ages -- though, truth be told, the older the better.Bee Movie is best viewed as an oddball career move rather than as a successful movie.This digitally animated feature is not a great movie, but it is colorful, imaginative and solid entertainment. In many respects, it\\'s more educational and more exciting than it is laugh-out-loud funny.Does Bee survive the hype? Not quite, but it is semi-charming and reasonably clever in that facile Dreamworks Animation kind of way.Seinfeld comedy is cute fun for the whole family.Bee Movie isn\\'t the second coming of Seinfeld, but there\\'s just enough of his singular personality to engage fans and enough buzzy action to delight the holiday kid audience.Pleasant but entirely forgettable.Bee Movie feels phoned in on every level.At its relaxed best, when it\\'s about, well, nothing, the slyly comic Bee Movie is truly beguiling.It\\'s on the easygoing level of Surf\\'s Up, and a full tick up from, say, Over the Hedge or The Ant Bully. But given the Seinfeld pedigree it\\'s something of a disappointment.An often-inspired smart comedy for kids, and a vintage Seinfeld laugh for adults.It\\'s one of the better animated movies of the year--admittedly, rising to the top of a shallow pool.Isn\\'t quite as funny as The Swarm...neither frisky nor imaginative enough to merit even its short ninety-minute running time.The mock outrage and dry sarcasm of Seinfeld\\'s comic persona defines the movie\\'s hero, a worker bee with a high-pitched, often cracking whine.You might have been able to get away with stuff like this in the pre-Pixar age. Not anymore.Yet another animated flick with a starry cast in which a creature that ordinarily would seem pesky is rendered as not just harmless but even lovable and idiosyncratically human. Enough already.Infectiously amusing? More often than not.After Shrek the Third\\'s flatulence jokes, the return of that Seinfeldian wit brings animation up a level.On the whole, this is another disappointing animated effort and it resides considerably lower on the totem pole than this year\\'s current non-live action champion, Ratatouille.The film is nutty, ecological, antically funny, and moving, all at the same time.Seinfeld has completely dumbed-down his normal clever wit in order to appeal to younger kids; they\\'re probably the only ones who might enjoy this.It\\'s bee-buzzingly silly.If only every bee were named \\'Chris Rock\\' the movie would have the stinging humor it sorely lacks.Unfortunately, bees just aren\\'t that funny.Amiable but no more.nannannannannanI was convinced I was going to hate this film. But, it didn\\'t bug me as much as I thought it would.I think it should be considered child abuse to inflict this tripe upon children.There\\'s a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved, and Duff, who\\'s gone from wholesome to haggard in two short years, is flat-out scary.This is definitely a family trip to stay home and skip.There\\'s something pernicious about a toxic mix of sitcom and snickering sex jokes getting packaged and effectively sold as wholesome fun for the family.Its heart is in the right place, but a reliance on gimmicks and sentiment undermines the story. In the end, both the laughs and the tears here come just a little too cheap. All I wanted to do was rent Ron Howard\\'s Parenthood again just to remind myself that Steve Martin once made a film about families that was both honest and funny.Martin and Levy mug for their close-ups and then retire to their trailers while the stunt doubles do the really hard work.A couple of good chuckles can\\'t redeem this sappy mess.A miserable experience filled with crude slapstick, cruder sentiment and retrograde jokes....[takes] a dated, sitcom approach that reveals just how little the filmmakers think of their audience.A family fantasy that plays at being happy and picture-perfect but primarily comes off as fake and dismayingly unfunny.The treacle spreads like molten lava and everyone ends up flat on their molasses.if you go to this movie and find any decent laugh in there whatsoever, you should know right now that I have nothing but utter contempt for you.[A] cinematic Bataan death march of pratfalls, kicks to the crotch, leg-humping dogs, pseudo-adorable rugrats who are a collective menace to society, and stomach-turning schmaltz...This sequel is just a string of lame slapstick gags, where Steve Martin acts handicapped, makes a fool of himself and gets a wetsuit stuck up his butt.Cheaper by the gross.Here\\'s a sentence I never thought I\\'d write: Carmen Electra is more interesting than Steve Martin.This cheerless, tiresome sequel is so tastless and flimsy that it proves big families aren\\'t much fun after all.I wonder how many meetings they had before they came up with that title. And didn\\'t we just see this movie a couple of weeks ago, and wasn\\'t it called Yours, Mine and Ours?Any movie that stars Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt can\\'t be all bad, and this one isn\\'t.... you may get a half-hour sitcom\\'s worth of laughs, but little more.... feels cobbled together by a committee fresh from a marathon of family reunion and summer camp comedies.Crammed with moppet mayhem, mawkish sentiment and bruising slapstick, it\\'s a flat-footed retread only Right to Lifers could love.Even the bloopers during the closing credits stink.The humor in Sam Harper\\'s script is as malnourished as Hilary Duff appears to be.For the most part, director Adam Shankman keeps the mayhem comprehensible.It aims to be pleasant and good-natured, which it is. There are enough laughs scattered throughout to keep everything moderately amusing, and the cast is likeable.While their last movie relied on boisterous physical humor, this is built on a family feud.The movie may play better on video screens in the back of minivans, but I suspect even seat-belted children will remain unimpressed.Shankman drops the ball at the finish line, jettisoning the tough-love fun for cheap sentimentality.This by-the-numbers pratfall-fest is as synthetically generic as a \"Happy Holidays\" card from your realtor.The kids will love it; parents will just have to put up with it. This film is funniest when it doesn\\'t try so hard.Sequels to comedies usually come with a risk to one\\'s digestive system, and sequels to bad comedies should carry a warning label.Unfortunately in this instance, more doesn\\'t make merry, only mayhem.Two Dozens and Ours together don\\'t have a dozen laughs between them.Moviegoers who enjoyed the PG anarchy the first time around should find amusement in the second Dozen. If the last picture left you with a migraine and a sense of claustrophobia, the sequel will be another bout of pain.Unfortunately, this family comedy doesn\\'t live up to its promising premise.There is no hilarity, just a couple of veteran funnymen going through the hellishly predictable motions in this unimaginative and unnecessary sequel.There is a good movie to be made about the difficulties parents have in letting go of their children. Actually, Ron Howard already made that movie. It was called Parenthood and it starred Steve Martin.If the creators seem lethally bored with their product, most viewers will find their patience tested, too.The film is at its best when it\\'s not trying to be desperately funny, but that\\'s rare.I did say almost. As comedies and sequels go, this one still isn\\'t any good. The writing by screenwriter Sam Harper is astonishingly limp, going to places even a bad NBC sitcom would be afraid to tread.A cheerless sequel to an uninspired remake.Jimmy\\'s kids\\' resentment is noticed only by the keenly attentive Carmen Electra. This half-hearted, obviously obligatory sequel feels labored and twice as long as it really is.Cute kids. Harried fathers. Wise, understanding mothers. Some stupid pet tricks. A little girl falls in love. Over-protective father messes things up. Money isn\\'t everything. Tender moments. And lots of pratfalls.Sure ain\\'t a movie. Nope, it\\'s a product, pure and very simple and carefully tested to sell to the widest possible market.All the characters get in fights but, SPOILER ALERT, everything ends with hugs, violins, good wishes and warm hearts.As I watched this sequel, a certain good feeling began to make itself known. Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake Yours, Mine and Ours.It\\'s a strange feeling to come out of a movie aimed at kids, much less a sequel to something like Cheaper by the Dozen, and not feel as though I need a shower and a vasectomy.After making Shopgirl, it appears Steve Martin had a lobotomy.Yeah, cheaper is right.Bland, canned but studiously professional.A harmless, inoffensive bit of family programming during the holiday season -- and there\\'s nothing wrong with that. But \\'harmless\\' doesn\\'t have to mean dull.This messy blend of silly slapstick and oversentimentality probably won\\'t please children, teenagers or adults.Heed my warning: Unless you guys stop going en masse to movies like the first Cheaper by the Dozen, genuinely funny people like Hunt, Martin and Levy will forever be forced to pay their heating bills doing bland franchise fillers like this.Martin\\'s soul is for sale, dirt cheap.Shallow, meandering, predictable, padded, and jam-packed with one unfunny, hoarily conceived slapstick bit or pratfall after the next.The big Baker clan goes for a vacation at a Wisconsin lake, and we get drowned in a sea of slapstick and schmaltz...but it\\'s actually an improvement on its predecessor.Concerned with pat platitudes about learning to say goodbye, the importance of family, and the superiority of parental leniency over authoritarian strictness.Okay, everybody, back to your shopping--there\\'s nothing to see here.nannannannannanThe real appeal of the movie is Bolt himself. The combined talents of the Disney animators and John Travolta\\'s earnest voice-work make for one lovable mutt. A film with a great story and something for everyone. [Full review in Spanish]Restores some faith that there are some creative minds left in animated films that Pixar hasn\\'t added to its talent pool.It\\'s sophisticated look is rich with details that are easy to take for granted, but which add immeasurably to the texture and dimension of the scenes.The latest generation of animated flicks is a sort of latter-day vaudeville revue. Kiddies who take Bolt to heart may conclude not only that dogs really do have superpowers, but also that everybody\\'s in showbiz.Wait... an all-star voice cast for a computer-animated story we\\'ve never heard of before, and it\\'s watchable, too?A touch slight by Disney standards, but even if it\\'s not high art, it\\'s still warm-and-fuzzy fun.Bolt marks Disney\\'s long awaited re-emergence as a top-dog in the world of animation....a fairly winning animated endeavor.What Bolt lacks in originality it makes up for in execution.Unmistakably bears the conflicting influence of Pixar and Disney\\'s old ideals.Are your kids ready for an existential movie? Turns out they are: Disney\\'s CGI-animated action comedy Bolt is, at its core, a story of one individual\\'s discovery that his sense of reality...has been seriously skewed. [Blu-ray]Focused, fun and action-packed, Disney\\'s Bolt proves that it doesn\\'t need the Pixar banner to make an excellent CG animated film.John Travolta\\'s earnest, gentle voice performance as the title character goes a long way in making this Disney animated feature a winner.So much fun, you might be tempted to conclude that Disney\\'s acquisition of the amazing Pixar team has inspired the already in-house Disney team to new heights.Molonoti me ton Lasseter kapoy pano ap\\' tin paragogi, na tis dinei aroma Pixar, i prototypia tis tainias tis Disney eksantleitai se merika oraia panarismata kai haritomenes gonies tainias drasis sti skinothesia, i asfaleia tis sto problepsimo senario omosI had a lot more fun at Bolt than I initially thought I would.The plot is sentimental fluff. But this has energy and invention enough to keep Lasseter top of the heap.The wonderfully expressive features on Bolt make him feel almost real and the movie has enough charm and humour to please both adults and children.The latest Disney animation has everything going for it, from a cast including John Travolta and Miley Cyrus to a truly brilliant premise.Bolt\\'s nothing short of a winning mix of pixel perfect magic.Tremendously lovable and funny stuff.Wittier by the reel, Bolt is can\\'t-miss family entertainment, and a glad relief from the solemnities of award season.Bolt is a damn enjoyable and undeniably funny film.For entertainment value, there\\'s nothing this week to rival Bolt. It\\'s a clever, funny family film.Bolt has all the wit, wisdom and top class computer imagery of a Pixar film, with the star voice cast of a Disney release.Bolt is fast-paced, funny and beautifully animated -- a charming movie that would have Benji and Lassie howling in jealousy.The unlikely superhero of this film is the hamster, who brings the funny amid a flurry of weaker gags. But Bolt still has charm - it just won\\'t hit with the adults the way the best animated films can.Its hero may lack any real super bark but this comic cartoon comes with a sharply ironic bite.The fact that the hamster steals the film speaks volumes about the lack of fresh ingredients.It\\'s a neat progression for Disney that finds balance between the studio\\'s old-school charm and Pixar\\'s dynamic modern outlook.If a little twee for grown-ups, this is riotous fun for kids. Even if it\\'s not Pixar-perfect, it\\'ll definitely do until Up touches down.Even if it\\'s a bit too knowing in places for children and a bit lightweight in others for adults, as a whole it gives Pixar every chance to show that even with a moderate story line it can give us something to savour.It\\'s a lovely, often hilarious piece of work.Great action and witty sight gags raise the toon bar.There really isn\\'t anything terribly fresh nor distinctive here.Super-cute, even though there\\'s not much there.Bolt combines Pixar smarts with classic Disney storytelling.While it may lack a certain amount of bite, there\\'s plenty of bark to recommend this winning animated adventure.Adults should get a good kick out of these animal characters and the exemplary personality quirks that go beyond just image perfection.If you feel as though you need to borrow a child to buy a ticket for this cutest of cute films, go right ahead. You won\\'t want to miss this adorable animated film about a dog who thinks he\\'s a superhero\\'Bolt\\' is consistently entertaining because its characters are so endearing.This lively animated adventure keeps us entertained even if the story and characters aren\\'t particularly well-developedThis is the best action adventure movie for kids I\\'ve seen in a long, long time.A frisky addition to that collection of man\\'s best friend movies, with a generous portion of one-joke-fits-all humor to captivate kid and adult audiences alike.With the holiday season officially underway, \"Bolt\" is the perfect present for the whole family.It\\'s entertaining while it lasts but dissipates from memory the moment it\\'s over.Bolt is a good but not great film which should earn Walt Disney Animation a deserved hit even if it won\\'t quite return them to the heights of their own creative and commercial heyday.Let\\'s not underestimate the significance of a workmanlike Disney animation.Super-dog adventure is fun, age-appropriate for kids.BOLT is an insignificant cartoon, but undeniably enjoyable. I was smiling through most of it and I imagine kids will too.Bolt? More like Sparky. The movie is nowhere near as good as this year\\'s best animated film, \"Wall-E,\" but it does zip with energy, the story escalates nicely and, in the end, it\\'s a good time.The unappealing cross-country trip of a dog, a cat, and a hamster.There\\'s something both simple and sweet about Bolt, yet epic, that\\'s entirely surprising....arguably the best non-Pixar [animated] film that Disney has released in some time... [A]t best, it\\'s an amusing by-the-numbers effort.Straight-ahead star power is provided by teeny-bop pop star Miley Cyrus as Penny and John Travolta who looks better as an animated dog than he did in drag in Hairspray.That it falls short of Pixar\\'s lofty heights doesn\\'t mean the attempt isn\\'t worthwhile; indeed, Bolt is the most entertaining and well-crafted Disney Animation movie in years.Belief may be in question for much of the movie -- only for the perturbed pooch -- but fortunately, enjoyment is never a problem.If only first-time directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard would have followed the advice in their own film, Bolt could have turned out to be incredibly extraordinary.Bolt is packed with action sequences, but it finds room for humor and heart, too.Whenever a new kids\\' film comes out, there\\'s always the hope that it\\'ll work for adults, too. Alas, not this time. But the kids will probably like it.Sharply-drawn supporting characters, a solid narrative hook and slickly constructed action-adventure sequences help make for a vibrant, engaging, feel-good treat that will connect strongly with younger viewers.Bolt, with its numerous winks and nudges, reminds us how attuned we are to the falseness of pop culture, which isn\\'t the same thing as connecting us with its truths.While Bolt isn\\'t as funny, memorable or inspired as the animation classic from which it pilfers, it\\'s still beautifully animated, cleanly told, professionally voiced and makes you smile without insulting your intelligence.Overall it\\'s basically a crass marketing concept closer to Beverly Hills Chihuahua than a fully conceived work of art like Wall-E.Disney surely sees that inside the kinetic movement of Pixar films is a lot of restraint. Bolt is super-fast, yet not as super-sincere as it would like to believe.Wall-E, it\\'s not, but its target kiddie audience will have no problem whatsoever adopting Bolt.At the end of the day, Bolt is a sweet Disney family film, but Lasseter\\'s oversight has made it smarter than it otherwise would have been.You won\\'t need to keep a pack of tissue at the ready here, but Bolt does have some lump-in-the-throat moments courtesy of a vividly drawn, huggable main character you grow to love.Bolt isn\\'t a dazzler, but it\\'s entertainment with heart.I\\'m never a big fan of animal films and I admit it\\'s because, though I am by no means a crier, pets losing their friends or getting lost gets me all choked up. Frankly, it\\'s embarrassing. But if you can make me sniffle, you\\'ve won me over. Bolt...sniffIt\\'s smart enough to keep adults on their toes and exciting enough to keep a kid with a short attention span glued to his seat.What this mutt lacks in uniqueness it makes up for in puppyish charm, high-class velocity and enough pop culture crackle to keep most demographics suitably amused.The directors and screenwriters hit all their marks and push all the right buttons, but the story never really takes off, and the characters never really spark to life.Adults won\\'t find much to enjoy here, though the dog\\'s high-octane action series serves as a perverse parody of Jerry Bruckheimer-style summer blockbusters.Bolt has the magical quality of great animation, the ability to touch us without the hint of preachiness or manipulation.The format brilliantly brings an audience that much closer to a handful of increasingly lonely, yet contagiously enthusiastic, animals.Its script is smart, its conceit a heart-tugger in the finest of senses, and it\\'s the first Disney effort in way too long to be more concerned with being a movie than with being a breeding ground for product tie-ins.Make a little room Lady, Tramp and all you Dalmatians, Disney\\'s got a new animated dog to bark about.No future classic, but a pleasant little movie with a fiercely devoted little hero.With its vibrant look, frisky attitude and sweet lesson about loyalty and friendship, Bolt is solid, fresh family-friendly entertainment.The film breezes by in what feels like an instant, the emotional warmth exuded by the relationships within both genuine and true.Cute, clever, and enjoyable.Bolt\\'s double identity allows young viewers to imagine the fun of owning a cuter version of Krypto while it also affirms Charles M. Schulz\\'s assertion that happiness is a warm puppy...In its best moments, it gently shows us how Bolt\\'s discoveries parallel those of a child in learning self-reliance.Like \\'Homeward Bound\\' and \\'Incredible Journey,\\' it teaches tiny tots that - with friendship and love - you don\\'t need superpowers to be a hero.A holiday standout.If Bolt does not quite rise to the level of bona fide Pixar masterpieces like Wall-E, Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, it does manage to be frisky, funny and inventive enough to engage the attention of grown-ups as well as children.To paraphrase a line often misattributed to Samuel Johnson, this Disney-aspires-to-Pixar combination is both original and good; the problem is the original parts aren\\'t good and the good parts aren\\'t original.As usual, the sidekick animals steal the show. That tradition goes all the way back to those singing mice in Cinderella. Maybe even before then.Well-made, pleasant, diverting, unobjectionable -- and absolutely nothing special.If you can get past the wafer-thin premise that serves as the foundation for Bolt, you\\'ll find that it is a rather entertaining movie.A key part of the film\\'s success is that Penny, the object of Bolt\\'s devotion, really is a sweet kid who loves her furry co-star.While Bolt doesn\\'t quite contain the same charm and slick storytelling that defines the Pixar films, it is still a mostly enjoyable film that should appeal to all ages.The story is shamelessly derivative, but you won\\'t mind much because it\\'s so gentle and warm-hearted.Bolt\\'s\" basic story is nothing too original, but its underpinnings and flourishes are smart and inventive.Has the right amount of sincerity, schmaltz and silliness to make Bolt entertaining for everyoneFunny, charming, and a feast for the eyes. It is also quite probably the best animated film made by Disney in years.Parental Content Reviewboasts much of the humor, character development, story layering, and unmistakable heart Pixar has brought to the animation genreThe writing team of Dan Fogelman and co-director Williams have concocted one of the most witty and often hilarious Disney outings in years.Bolt is a jolt of joy, a computer-animated delight that is delirious with laughs.Funny and heartwarming, if not entirely original, Bolt is bound to charm audiences of all ages.Charming and frequently exciting.What I couldn\\'t predict was how much I would enjoy the simple pleasures of a warm, witty, well-written story -- especially when it is told with the state-of-the-art computer animation that is easy to take for granted in these techno-savvy days.The digital comedy-adventure starts out pretty slow and never really finds its footing, especially in regards to its needed comic edge.Bolt is earnest, wholesome, family entertainment. In a word, it\\'s Disney, which seems to have remembered that those attributes are really nothing to be ashamed of.While this charmer about a canine James Bond does not pack the emotional punch of WALL-E, it\\'s frisky fun to see the white shepherd get a new leash on life.No classic but not a dog in spite of being about one.For the first time in years, it feels like Disney has done its namesake proud.It\\'s a seriously withholding action comedy, stingy on the wit, charm, jokes, narrative satisfactions and animals with personalities sharp enough for the big screen.Familiar territory, but the Disney team still knows how to bring a story to life.A warm and even perceptive family film, not always original but undeniably sweet-natured.A digital hamster takes on Pixar\\'s industry domination - and kicks butt.The story is somewhat predictable, but it\\'s sweet and happy and the animation is first-rate.There\\'s something touching about the yearning for ordinary life and decency that, to judge by its ubiquity in films for the nominally innocent, plagues those who live and work in the realms of the unreal.Your pre-tweens and tweens will love Bolt, though; the good news is that there\\'s an excellent chance you\\'ll like it, too.Fun, four-legged scampering isn\\'t enough when the characters are so unmemorable, the high concept is so wobbly and the journey doesn\\'t have you rooting for a reunion.Mild amusement is about the best you can hope for, but Bolt never bores.Bolt is a winner and proof that Disney Animation is really trying to catch up to Pixar in both story quality and animation.It\\'s a great day in America when the complicated looks so easy, and when we expect smart storytelling as a rule, not the exception.Pixar masterpieces aside, it\\'s been quite a while since Disney cranked out an animated movie worthy of its fairy-dust-sprinkled castle logo.the film succeeds because it has genuine heart, a couple of mildly-thrilling action sequences, and most notably, a hilarious supporting performance by Mark Walton, who plays Rhino the hamster.Bolt is perfectly amiable but rarely brisk, with neither its premise nor its execution quite inspired enough to elicit more than faint admiration.The lack of screenwriting imagination is offset by the inherent charm of the picture, resulting in a pleasing arrangement of CG-animated action set-pieces and slapstick comedy to push Bolt beyond the repetitive family film norm.Disney\\'s movie taps into our desire to believe that the happy hound sleeping at the end of our beds is as brave, noble, loyal, and devoted as he seems.[A]s sensitive and spirited as [it is] gorgeous to look at...[W]hen the canine protagonist of Bolt borrows a character arc from Buzz Lightyear, even youngsters will smell a rip-off.Disney\\'s strongest CG animated effort to date can be credited to the strength of a premise that mixes what\\'s worked so well in earlier Disney animated films with a better awareness of what makes a movie entertaining both for kids and adults.It\\'s got a great ensemble cast. It\\'s not the most original idea but still effective nonetheless.The film is funny -- with a sophistication that might actually appeal more to adults. But there\\'s still plenty for the kids to enjoy.The Disney animated blockbuster-to-be Bolt is a delightful family movie, and if I\\'d seen it as a kid I would have been deeply traumatized.Movie magic aplenty in animated action adventure from Disney.Although it will never be mistaken for Pixar pedigree, this genial production is a notable step up for Walt Disney Animation Studios.nanThe fact that this trilogy has concluded is for the best. There\\'s nowhere else for these characters to go.If this movie had a theme song it would be, \"The Lazy Song\" by Bruno Mars because its doing nothing at all.Here, while the routines are as polished as ever, everything else is tired, not least Fat Amy\\'s fat jokes. Time for a new song, ladies.A lot of what makes the franchise special and fun feels forced here.The Bellas even know that they are past their prime and this film acts as one last hoopla for them.Dialog is still witty enough to keep us laughing, but the characters are now saddled with contrived plotlines, corny slapstick and some feeble attempts at sentimentality.The strain is showing in this third entry, with too many of the characters placed in developmental holding patterns and too much of the storyline given over to daft contrivances.Fans will be pleased enough with the slapstick and musical offerings here. Rebel Wilson, again, owns the film with her pleasantly abrasive wit, her broad appeal spiced by the fact that this is her first movie to come out after her libel case victory. ...a festive film. [Full Review in Spanish] This third delivery ends up having the best numbers and the most ingenious mash-up\\'s of the franchise. [Full Review in Spanish]The film has a bigger budget than the previous outings - glitzy European locations, star cameos and so on - but none of the charm.The musical part is still a guilty pleasure. [Full Review in Spanish]If ever a flimsy film franchise was going to fold in on itself by instalment three, you would bet the house it would be Pitch Perfect.The film\\'s message - about moving on and letting go of the past - is one that it seems incapable of taking on board.For all its frivolity, fans should be more than satisfied with this final run around the track. As a fan of the original, I was let down. Hopefully that\\'ll be the end of the series.Whatever else is true of the movie, the cast is having fun, and Anna Kendrick gives phenomenal reaction shots.The pitch might not be perfect but might appeal to fans of the franchise.This franchise ran out of steam halfway through the credit crawl on the first movie, and there\\'s been nothing but garbage-in-garbage-out since then.... ends the trilogy with so much blunder... [Full review in Spanish]Should future encores take the stage, we can only hope they have a little more verve and imagination than this one.The biggest cause of the film\\'s problems lies in the B story in which Amy\\'s father, played by John Lithgow sporting a horrendous Australian accent, shows up trying to reconnect. As the movie wraps - and it really does feel like it\\'s a tidy wrap up and a goodbye to them - you might even realize how much you\\'ll miss them in the future.It\\'s good for nostalgia and a sense of closure, but it isn\\'t much of a movie.A movie we\\'ve seen and heard before, fresher, cuter and five years ago. The series limps its way to the finish line with a weak, not particularly funny effort.The real hit of this third PP outing comes, as ever, from the cast.The plot is paper-thin and too much of the comedy is reliant on the one-note battering ram that is Rebel Wilson.A comic franchise that has stayed loosely in tune with reality now goes screeching off into nonsense, with no good jokes to show for it.A-ca-trocious.This is a movie that wants you to laugh and enjoy the music, not engage in analysis. It\\'s time for the Barden Bellas to either exit stage left or be dragged off by the hook.The threequel goes for a big finale, but ends up flat when it strains to rope in new genres.A typically winning central turn from Kendrick and some Pitch Perfect staples just about save the day. Pitch Perfect finally leaves the stage. And after a solid performance too.Someone get masterful video game director Hideo Kojima on the line and throw out the idea for Metal Gear Fat AmyThe second, and now third installments have turned into meandering messes with few jokes that land and a cast that, while talented, doesn\\'t really get to do much.Out of tune.If this really is the last \"Pitch Perfect\" movie, I hate to contradict that \"Cups\" song, but we\\'re not going to miss them when they\\'re gone, when they\\'re gone.It feels as if this party is over and it is time to call it a day.This swan song is in serious need of some Auto-Tune.As surprising and unlikely as it may seem, the third time is finally and most definitely the charm for this series.The Top Secret of a capella competition movies.When a franchise descends to jokes about how it\\'s run out of ideas, and setting things on fire, not once but twice, it\\'s one movie past time to stop.The final pitch is a big miss.The wafer-thin plot barely sustains the songs and romance.Although I do think PP fans will be satisfied with the finale, let\\'s hope this is the last redux for these pitches.The film feels like a flimsy attempt to get The Bellas back together. It\\'s bereft of good ideas and tone deaf in terms of decent dialogue.The third and final installment in the \"Pitch Perfect\" franchise is aca-blah.Aca-nough already.An off-key dismantling of what made the concept work in the first place.A coarse, ugly, pointlessly action-packed reminder that every modestly sharp and amusing property must eventually be converted, by the commercial logic of Hollywood, into a soul-killing cash grab.The slim charms of the previous movies have been tossed away in favor of cringe-inducing cattiness and a ridiculous plot. There\\'s barely even any music. Aca-palling.The show\\'s over. We\\'re pitched out. Aca-exit stage left.The new third entry in the series isn\\'t interested in character development or logical storylines or anything resembling innovation. It\\'s lazy and limp and profoundly weird, and not in any meaningful way a \"good movie.Teenage boys get their shape-shifting robots, angry cars, and space wars, so if the Bellas want to sing \"Oops I Did It Again\" on a rocket, let them have it.Uneven series finale is best when there\\'s music. Despite the on-screen intelligence of Kendrick, plus a screenplay co-written by Mike White, this is a near-plotless, slapdash comedy marked by low-energy improvisation and strained slapstick.A total delight, thanks to its proven formula of clever pop arrangements, dry humor and superb casting.Unfortunately, it takes a sharp detour and goes down the action route, which ends up misfiring. With a thinnier, sillier story than ever before, the threequel is left with its twin pillars of appeal: musical performances by the core cast, and shtick, also by the core cast.[If you must], come for the jokes, the song and dance numbers, and the female camaraderie. Stay for... well, for those thingsThe Bellas aren\\'t invested in the film\\'s competition, and the filmmakers\\' aren\\'t invested in it, and you probably won\\'t be, either. So why bother even having one?Women deserve a better vehicle for demonstrating the power of female solidarity than this empty money grab.But it also ends with a sentimentality I didn\\'t buy - the Bellas don\\'t seem to particularly care about each other outside of a competitive setting, so why should we?While this has a few laugh-out-loud moments, overall, this is an adequate farewell performance that too often falls flat and feels off-key.As it jumps from one song to the next, the flimsy plot and occasionally amusing one-liners move to a generic beat but there\\'s enough energy in the musical numbers to deliver cheesy and diverting fun.A tired retread of better jokes in the first two movies, this drags along to an admittedly heartwarming conclusion.Gross, messy, unapologetic, awkward, stumbling - the women of Pitch Perfect are far from flawless, but the franchise never congratulates itself for that. Newsflash: This is how real women are.The third outing in the \"Pitch Perfect\" franchise is like a pop song remix that retains some of what you love about the original, while throwing in an out-of-nowhere bridge and an unwelcome guest verse.A strange hodgepodge of genres and tones, right down to a particularly off-putting mid-section montage that serves as a classic move-the-story-along device.The Bellas\\' musical journey has been stretched into a thin whimper. The movie is bubbly, it\\'s fast, it\\'s hella synthetic-clever, and it\\'s an avid showcase for the personalities of its stars ...It looks like these performers are genuinely enjoying themselves, and it\\'s infectious. Despite the preposterous escapades and the self-destructive satire, at the end of it all, there\\'s something real left standing.An entertaining if lifeless sequel, failing to capture the fun and vivacity of the first two films. Something of a Greatest Hits album thrown into the shops in time for Christmas....not so much a story as a victory lap...Once the USO tour is set into motion, it falls to Wilson to provide much of the humor here, and she is a skilled enough comic to push the narrative over most of its hurdles. But even she can\\'t quite finesse or explain John Lithgow.Eastwood and his actors create a brooding drama whose events and interrelationships seem surreally improbable yet painfully authentic.One of its best qualities is that it\\'s dark but not depressing. It is a film of magisterial, slow-burning power, one of the finest examples of recent American cinematic storytelling and certainly Eastwood\\'s most mature film.Eastwood tells the story simply, barely moving the camera. The only special effect in this film is genius.There is nothing romantic about the law of the streets, and its unforgiving nature has a finality that can\\'t be undone. Eastwood has an understanding of what it takes to live with yourself, not so much a sympathy as an appreciation.The entire cast did a phenomenal job, resisting the urge to overact too much, which is what you get for a film like this. Violence and revenge have been a staple of Eastwood\\'s work from the beginning, but here he explores his subject from a new, more ambiguous angle, with no regard for macho titillation. American drama doesn\\'t get any more meaty and muscular than this.The performances are uniformly superb.Good, occasionally powerful noir that\\'s been overhyped.Mystic falters occasionally, but I respect its effort and I\\'m happy to see Mr. Eastwood growing as a director.While not quite the equal of the novel, it\\'s more complex, emotionally-charged and better acted than the average Hollywood thriller.With characters that don\\'t belong in the film and resolutions that seem mere fantasy, Mystic River never surpasses adequacy.It is in many ways Eastwood\\'s tightest movie for some time, and certainly his darkest since Unforgiven; indeed, the ending offers as corrosive an assessment of the limits of American justice as anything in his career.A sprawling story that benefits from Eastwood\\'s stripped-down approach. There are no jive talking Tarantino exchanges here, and no crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics.This is one of the finer dramas to come down the pike in some time.The film births wonderful performances from all three lead actors, as well as Marcia Gay Harden, who\\'s palpable in preternatural ways, Thomas Guiry as the boy in love with Jimmy\\'s daughter, and virtually everyone else with a strip of film time.It\\'s a stately, handsome-looking studio drama that, for me, never really became emotionally or intellectually involving.... frustratingly humorless, harsh, and hollow, lacking the cohesiveness, color and convincing characterization of Eastwood\\'s masterpiece Unforgiven.Penn and Robbins, especially, are absolutely riveting in this haunting tale of lives lost.Methodical, riveting and emotionally charged.Sean Penn is so frighteningly good in this movie that he outdoes even the best of his earlier work.A fine movie but not the masterpiece you\\'ve heard.Eastwood\\'s best since Unforgiven.Mystic River explores the quirks of fate that make us who and what we are.[R]uns deep with sadness...It\\'s not the masterpiece people have been claiming, but Eastwood does set up a gripping moody atmosphere and get some fine performances out of his actors.A tale of tragic misinterpretation, Mystic River requires deep focus into the multiple tortured souls to fully be harnessed.Eastwood encourages Penn to overact, and Penn Method-ically responds with the enthusiasm of the amateur talents in Waiting for Guffman.This is the kind of film that slowly gets under your skin, drawing you more intimately into the sad existence of the characters.Less a taut whodunit than a dreary who-cares-it, Mystic River is muddy-swamp-slow and about as appealing to look atThe unfashionably slow editing style and the concentration on close-ups and two-shots allow Eastwood to scrutinise his characters as they are forced to dig into themselves.While it may not be the masterpiece that some claim, it does have the heft and texture of a major work.Let\\'s make it simple. Mystic River is the great Hollywood studio film released this year.Robbins and Penn in particular give simply fantastic performances that defy description - it is the kind of work you have to just sit back and feel.Fiction doesn\\'t survive on believability alone. The unilluminating Mystic River offers depression without insight; drama without purpose.Works as a straight-up detective story, and the acting is often breathtaking.It\\'s a film worth queuing for - and you haven\\'t been able to say that about anything with Clint\\'s name on it in quite a while.Mystic River draws its power from the shadow murder throws over everyday life.When a murder mystery stars Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon you\\'re gonna have a hard time picking the killer. Eastwood directs without a trace of showiness.A superbly dense and dark thriller with psychological undertones, Mystic River is highly complex and tantalising.A flawed but engaging film, Mystic River succeeds through the sheer weight of talent involved.Mystic River returns Eastwood to the general excellence of the Oscar-winning Unforgiven while retaining the square-jawed plainspokenness that is his trademark.I can admit it\\'s a well-made film, but that doesn\\'t mean I approve.Eastwood\\'s screen adaptation of the famous Dennis Lehane novel is one of the year\\'s most well-made dramas.Despite a nagging sensation about its shortcomings, the acting and the atmospherics continue to haunt me.Tim Robbins took me on a wild chase. I think he was by far the best in this movie.A deeply felt, haunting work that ranks among Eastwood\\'s best films...While restrained and internal throughout most of the film, Penn displays both chilling intensity and heart-wrenching grief when it really counts.Everyone in the cast is brilliant. Everyone.This is a flawed film worth seeing for the portraits of three hollow men, and for Stern\\'s great camera work.Mystic River\" is teeming with various elements that flow together to create one of the finest movies of the year.An engrossing film that delights despite harboring what could be seen as a big flaw.Too depressing to fill audiences with delight, but it does seem to validate questionable attitudes, especially an indifference to the suffering of innocent people and a willingness to shoot first and ask questions later.It\\'s serious with a capital \\'S.\\' It\\'s the kind of grimness that smacks of a bid for Importance with a capital \\'I\\' -- hopefully leading to an Oscar with a captial \\'O.\\'It\\'s Penn\\'s heavy-lidded, dead-behind-the-eyes turn that overshadows all, carrying the weight, pain and misery of the world -- and the picture.A film with better intentions than execution.A mournful meditation on America\\'s heritage of violence...The real triumph is that while we are fascinated with the particulars of the story, we feel the shame, awkwardness, fears and cosmic fate that bounce off each character.While a commercial film is more about entertainment, this is more about, for want of a better term, art.Mystic River may only be \\'pretty good,\\' but thanks to Eastwood, it\\'s a reminder of how great \\'pretty good\\' should be.So entrenched in anguish that you\\'ll leave feeling empty and unhappy.Penn\\'s performance galvanizes grief.As an emotional rumination on death and its aftermath, it is gripping.... bores its way in and lingers for hours, even days before we finally can come to terms with it - and ourselves. But the less we know, the more we understand.An apprehensive cross between an elegiac tone poem of loss, an ever-twisting murder mystery, and a character study revolving around the regret of lost innocence, Mystic River tries to be all of these things and ends up falling short on all counts.Deeply serious, sombre, long and humourless, it reeks of integrity. Eastwood\\'s best since Unforgiven? Maybe, but it\\'s the one I\\'d least like to sit through again.A lot more effective than most similar cop thrillers that go only for the conventional bang-bang scenarios.Shows you can pile on a lot of freight and still end up with a barge.If Sean Penn isn\\'t the finest actor working today, Mystic River sure makes it difficult to name an alternative.Solid, rarely showy performances, meticulously recreated detective work and moments of pure unadulterated grief accent this whodunit, a movie that will have those who haven\\'t read the book fooled for much of its length.Eastwood has crafted one of the most powerful American dramas in years.While seemingly a straightforward murder mystery in a matter-of-fact setting, it is never quite what it seems, and it percolates with themes and ideas of astonishing richness.Contains so many layers that you\\'ll want to see it more than once. It\\'s one for the memory books.There is depth in this movie, and fine acting. But even more intriguing, there are questions... questions with no clear answers.Eastwood has transformed the slow burn he\\'s shown in so many of his movies in the past and brought it to every character in this movie, and to this top-notch film.Eastwood\\'s hands-off directing normally leaves much to desire. But with Mystic River\\'s powerful house cast and emotional gut-wretching story, one respects the lack of showiness and triteness.I can\\'t figure out why, but it didn\\'t really stick with me once I left the theater. It\\'s very good, but not transcendent.Eastwood has turned Lehane\\'s novel into a quietly brilliant and deeply unsettling film that ranks up with Unforgiven as his best directing work.Sober and imposing, Clint Eastwood\\'s Mystic River spreads over the screen with a sense of purpose.Smart, hard-charging, compassionate.The experience of being so absorbed in a movie and the lives of the people in it, of trusting a director and a writer and actors to take me places completely unexpected, is so rare that I savored every unexpected turn and twist.So deep-felt a movie about rage and retribution that will stick with you like a bad dream.This crime-oriented portrait of characters snared by their environment leads to an excruciatingly powerful buildup, before it surrenders to contrivance in its final act.Clint Eastwood\\'s latest directorial effort is perhaps the best film he\\'s ever made.[A] stunning mediation on loss...Those who can stomach the dark subject matter and the daunting running time are rewarded with a work of sublime maturity.Eastwood\\'s maturity is reflected in the story that doesn\\'t back away from hard subjects and can admit that pain and remorse can mold a man\\'s life.Resonates more deeply than any film this year.A solid whodunit, with disturbing, provocative, take-home insights into human nature.A masterpiece of the first order.Deals with themes Eastwood has often explored before, but never so delicately or with as much sad wisdom: The way in which our past haunts our present, the lasting repercussions of violence and the cruel inexorability of fate.It is an impressive movie masquerading as an important one.a deeply atmospheric murder mystery in which we wonder less about who committed the crime and more about who will ultimately pay for it.Eastwood has handed Penn the role of a lifetime, and the actor scorches the screen with his anguish and angry vengefulness.[Eastwood] masterfully gives the story and characters their proper amount of breathing room and translates the script into fluid, fertile visual passages dripping with heart, heartache, passion, compassion and rage.Complicated, enigmatic and haunting...easily Eastwood\\'s best film since \\'Unforgiven,\\' and one of the most compelling pictures of the year.A measured, leisurely paced but moving Shakespearean tragedy.A masterfully melancholy work with an Oscar worthy screenplay.A leisurely paced, intense, gloomy but ultimately, fulfilling motion picture.Eastwood and his terrific cast leave you shaken in ways that matter.It\\'s easy to run out of superlatives when describing this movie... no doubt this is one of the best pictures of the year.Vibrant and coldly compelling, Mystic River succeeds in spinning a profoundly American tale on the level of grand tragedy.One thing you can count on from Clint, it\\'s making a movie that seems a lot longer than it really is. I\\'m not sure that\\'s a great quality to have when it comes to filmmaking.Mystic River is refreshingly adult; Eastwood doesn\\'t pander to a younger crowdThis victims-of-circumstance crime yarn betters the book in a number of ways[Eastwood] isn\\'t afraid to take his time telling a story, letting it breathe like a good wine and thereby making it feel more like life than a movie.Mystic River is pretty strong stuff, the best straight drama to emerge from Hollywood this year.Director Clint Eastwood has mined more Oscar gold with his most profound work since \\'Unforgiven.\\'The type of film I imagine you could return to time and again only to discover previously unseen layers.It\\'s also the best movie made by any American filmmaker this year, and quite possible the best thing Eastwood has ever done as a director.If Euripides had ever known Catholic guilt, he might have written something quite similar to Mystic River.Despite all involved, Mystic River never quite equals the sum of its parts....another Eastwood meditation on the ripple effect of violence.Eastwood and his perfectly cast ensemble have added layers that give this blue collar multi-generational tragedy Shakespearean scope. It is one of those rare films that surpasses the impact of the book.As rich and bleeding a work as [Eastwood has] ever made.For all its missteps, Mystic River gets the big things right: It turns you inside out with grief.Uneven but ultimately absorbing adaptation of Dennis Lehane\\'s best-selling novel.Despite dragging a little, Mystic River is worth its weight in what will certainly be Oscar gold.There is a solid story here, but it\\'s weakened by heavy-handed dialogue, strained symbolism and subplots that don\\'t got anywhere.Don\\'t be fooled by the contemporary Boston setting. For all intents and purposes, Clint Eastwood has made another superlative western.When someone sets out to tell a story about child molestation and murder of teenagers, you don\\'t expect a happy, fun time... but the story doesn\\'t say anything unique about these depressing subjects.Clint Eastwood\\'s best film since Unforgiven is another look at murder, death and the good in men that can die long before they do.A melodramatic murder-mystery that is as uneven as its outcome is anticlimactic.\\'Mystic River\\' is an ambitious failure but it is, ultimately, a failure. It is a shame because there are a lot of little things that I liked about it even as the big things never quite added up.Splendid acting by Sean Penn as the merchant, Kevin Bacon as the cop, Laurence Fishburne as his partner, Tim Robbins as Dave, and Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden as the central female characters in the story.If Mystic River is just a bit overplayed, a tad too highly pitched, it still resonates with grief and fury and feeling.The movie eloquently mourns the death of innocence and friendship. It also is a showcase for six stunning performances.The performances are exquisite.Intelligent adult fare is hard to find on the big screen, but Clint Eastwood manages nicely with this tough ensemble piece.The acting throughout is exceptional, rooted in observed realism, but suggestive of more mythical agents at work through the lives of human beings.A truly powerful portrait of community and lost innocence.The film and its actors are at their best when acknowledging the tragedy of inarticulate men banging their heads against fate.Up the Mystic River without a paddle is how I felt about halfway into this soggy Eastwood-meets-melodrama mess of a movie.Eastwood\\'s most soulful, and most organic, movie.It is a movie to closely watch and to savour; the confident direction and the flawless ensemble performances are, quite simply, worthy of Oscars.It would be wrong to single out any one of these performances. Eastwood has assembled a bonanza cast here and each comes out shining.If [Eastwood] were a more subtle director, it would be a great film; as it is, it\\'s an extremely good one, anchored by the subtly devastating performances of Penn, Robbins and Bacon.Mystic River is a rare movie that improves on its source material. It was a very good book, but the movie is great.Mystic River is full of details that stay with you.A movie experience that carries a lingering, powerful aftershock.An adult drama rich in emotional textures.Eastwood\\'s best direction since Unforgiven and arguably the best, most mature work of his career.Excellent.[An] utterly absorbing film.A riveting story with complex situations and extremely well defined characters.Crisply well-crafted and beautifully acted.River leads moviegoers on a suspense-filled, sometimes painful adventure marked by great performances.A compelling film that could have been a classic with some judicious editing in the end and a rethink of the climax.Not quite The Great American Tragedy, by a moving work exploring the underbelly of family lives.It wants to be a big, serious movie. It has big, serious star power and big, serious themes. There are moments of power and flickers of meaning but it is ultimately hollow and unsatisfying.Mystic River left me physically shaking, and has since taken up permanent residence in my nightmares.There\\'s no emotional connection to the characters. This is cookie cutter anguish meant to manipulate the gullible into believing that they\\'re watching something meaningful.I am so accustomed to inventing \"angles\" for my reviews that a movie like this threatens to flummox me. It defies all angles and conventional approaches.A modern epic tragedy, where the weight of everyone\\'s actions are felt from conception to enactment.A virtuoso achievement for everyone involved whose final credits actually read \"Music by Clint Eastwood\". If a more apropos coda could exist, I couldn\\'t think of one.There\\'s something to the tribal primitivism of the picture, the idea that man at his essence is composed of balanced portions of nobility and violence.Despite the faultless execution, this ultimately unedifying story of pointless murder is ... hopelessly contrived.So filled with extraordinary performances that you hardly know where to start in discussing it ... Penn, Robbins, Harden and Eastwood all deserve Oscar nominations.Slowly trudges through the motions of a tired whodunit, saving its dramatic juices for a blowout finale that never comes.A powerful tale of crime, guilt, and punishment.This is an extremely well-crafted and powerful film with searing performances from the all-star cast, most notably Sean Penn and Tim Robbins.The performances are all good. However, the film experiences one coincidence after the other, manipulating its audiences rather heavy-handedly.Each of the three childhood friends who grow up to become the main characters of Mystic River brings the film a particular style of revelation.This tense, gripping character study is a cleverly complex, powerful and original American tragedy. Clint Eastwood once again displays an astonishing visual sense. Problem is: it\\'s too obvious whodunit.Riveting moviemaking in the popular vein...Eastwood avoids easy answers and sentimental compromises.A tense murder-mystery that finds director Clint Eastwood on familiar ground exploring themes of good and evil, guilt and innocence, anger and revenge.Resonates long after the last fade-out.A haunting, ambitious but ultimately flawed film that treads some of the same somber moral territory director Clint Eastwood explored in Unforgiven.After many meticulously drawn connections, it\\'s a disappointment to see most of our two-plus hours of careful attention thrown away.Mesmerizing filmmaking.A solid crime thriller.Once again, a movie withholds vital information in order to pump up its dramatic level in the last act. This device may not be illegitimate, but...Mystic River is the rare American movie that aspires to -- and achieves -- the full weight and darkness of tragedy.This is mature, meaningful, thoroughly grown-up filmmaking that has something vitally important to say about the expanding effects of violence in society.What you end up admiring about the film is its literacy, its authenticity ... and its refusal to let us down easily.A classic whodunit.Plodding, emotionally inert, overlong, badly framed, inappropriately scored and polluted with an ensemble who try to outdo each other with bad performances.And I take a page from Ann Miller and say it\\'s all a load of horse-puckey.A somber evocation of a poor, close-knit section of Boston on the brink of moral collapse.A whodunnit with a deeply emotional core, thanks to L.A. Confidential scripter Brian Helgeland\\'s richly crafted, textured screenplay and the superb ensemble cast\\'s outstanding individual performances and collective chemistry.A movie of startling power and intimacy.One of [Eastwood\\'s] boldest and most soulful films to date.Solid direction, unfussy scripting and terrific acting -- particularly from Penn -- make the film a gripping experience.Mystic River is a complex, deeply ambiguous study of lifelong ties, moral accountability and the flukes of destiny.A crisp, well-made, visually astute film that will provoke and divide [Eastwood\\'s] admirers.nannannannanSecond City alum Nia Vardalos stars in this ethnic comedy, which she also wrote -- an ambitious way to break into a leading role; too bad the results are insubstantial.It\\'s greek to me.It offers the illusion of originality by bombarding audiences with Greek stereotypes, but really clings to the formulaic romance comedy.Ms. Vardalos\\' has loaded her charmingly fluffy script with cute idiosyncrasies in place of actual characters.The result feels a little over-egged at times and the love match lacks chemistry, but Ian\\'s whistlestop induction into a different style of language, food, drink, dress and dancing allows a few good one-liners.Endearing eccentricities, such as Toula\\'s father\\'s improvisational Greek etymologies of words like \"kimono\" and his reliance on Windex for a range of external-use medicinal purposes, help humanize the characters.It\\'s funny, it\\'s familiar and you can see a lot of the situations transferring over to your own life.It is a romantic comedy in the best classic Hollywood style, albeit one with some sharp writing and genuinely human as well as funny moments.Vardalos is not a great actress, but she is a likeable one ... John Corbett will never steer you wrong ... a cute premise, but it has all been done beforeThe family-friendly film avoids pitfalls, but the DVD is skimpy.The actors...bring out an attractive, warmhearted simplicity in each character. Above all, they portray a close, loving family, the film\\'s ultimate and lasting virtue.A cute little movie whose success proves that wherever they can find it, people will rise up and embrace the most mediocre, bland, and reassuring forms of art.Almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like \"The Addams Family\" to everyone looking in... \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" comes from the heart...On the whole, this film didn\\'t make me laugh much, didn\\'t make me \\'aaaaaah\\' much and didn\\'t give me any more insight into its astronomical popularity.This is not challenging stuff.Although films of this flavor depend primarily on their comic timing to win over an audience, director Joel Zwick finds other outlets of brilliance...This is the kind of romantic comedy you wish you saw more often.My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a jubilant mix of laughter, longing, forgiveness, sacrifice, commitment and, above all, balancing family obligations against true love.When Vardalos tries to pass one-joke stereotypes and situations as revelatory characterizations and experiences, it simply doesn\\'t achieve anything noteworthy.My Big Fat Greek Wedding may not exactly be an innovative film, but it most certainly is a lovable one.Great fun.My Big Fat Greek Wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor.To their credit, Hanks and Wilson stuck to their guns, keeping Vardalos and her ethnicity in a film that is as much a triumph of the underdog and word-of-mouth as it is a box office success.There is nothing subtle or original about this film, but it is well-intentioned and cute.Warm, familiar, not a sharp edge in sight, this movie is built to please.We can see the wheels turning, and we might resent it sometimes, but this is still a nice little picture, made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer.Only in the movies can Joey Fatone and Andrea Martin engage in Hellenic dance....begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully.It\\'s enjoyable, with a cracking performance from Michael Constantine as Toula\\'s father Gus.There isn\\'t enough drama to take My Big Greek Wedding out of TV movie territory.One of those movies that keeps you with a silly grin on your face throughout the majority of its running time.We\\'re sitting around the storyteller as she tells us about her family and all their crazy personalities and relationships with each other. And we can smile knowingly because family dynamics are easily relatable.It would be enjoyed by anyone who has been married, is married, wants to get married, or knows someone who is married.While I found the film of average entertainment, my friend loved it.This will have all non-Greeks in the audience wishing they could lay claim to some Mediterranean heritage.a delightfully warm-hearted look at the joys and exasperations of both family and ethnic heritage, an ode to everyday people and the joys of romance turning into lifelong love.Folks will come away from the film mistaking a warmth for their own experiences with an over-abundance of affection for My Big Fat Greek Wedding.I mean it only in the best sense when I say that My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a really nice movie.Exactly what its title implies: lusty, boisterous and utterly charming.A film of pure delight from beginning to end.The best date movie since When Harry Met Sally.A simple but likeable film that points out its characters\\' foibles while retaining an affection for their eccentricities.A circus full of wacky and interesting characters.Balances the specifics of the Greek-American culture with the transcendent universalities of family dynamics and makes you want to hug your own family.You don\\'t have to be Greek to enjoy My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and that\\'s precisely the point of it.Full of obvious humour and stereotyped characters, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is nonetheless delightful, mostly because the movie does not pretend to be anything it isn\\'t.My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a very slim movie that succeeds on its own modest terms without pretense or apology. No wonder it\\'s easy to like.This isn\\'t a groundbreaking movie ... but its situations are so recognizable and universal that you don\\'t need to be Greek to appreciate it.Vardalos is great as Toula and presents her character\\'s traits and peculiarities fittingly well.An embarrassment, a film so humiliating to everyone involved, it is shocking that protesters haven\\'t come out of the woodwork to scream bloody murder.An alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom...you\\'d be wise to send your regrets....manages - by virtue of its uncommon geniality - to convince us it\\'s about genuine human beings.The movie is consistently funny without ever going over the top -- a rarity in movies.There\\'s something wonderful about chaotic ethnic comedies, and this film taps straight into that vein.The reliability of the genre doesn\\'t excuse predictable jokes, pat fiascoes and so many stereotypes that one is tempted to alert the Greek anti-defamation league.Wedding feels a bit anachronistic. Still, not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak, and a happy ending is no cinematic sin.Though likable, its stock brand of comedy makes \"Meet The Parents\" look like a magnum opus of comic achievement by comparison.As a witness to several Greek-American weddings -- but, happily, a victim of none -- I can testify to the comparative accuracy of Ms. Vardalos\\' memories and insights.This romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in.With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea, this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool.This is a very funny, heartwarming film. It has fun with the quirks of family life, but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect.Even if you can\\'t pronounce \"gyro\" correctly, you\\'ll appreciate much of Vardalos\\' humor, which transcends ethnic boundaries.My Big Fat Greek Wedding is not only the best date movie of the year, it\\'s also a -- dare I say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally American, I might add -- slice of comedic bliss.As Toula, the frump who blossoms into a flower, Nia Vardalos delivers a lovely performance.It\\'s as warm as a double shot of Ouzo, as exotic as chicken-lemon soup and as sweet as a plate of honey-dripped baklava.My Big Fat Greek Wedding is that rare animal known as \\'a perfect family film,\\' because it\\'s about family.It\\'s a sweet, laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth.Will Toula have an enormous, boisterous and eccentric family? Absolutely. Will Ian\\'s parents be the most uptight white people this side of a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit? Of course. Will love conquer all in the end? You bet.One of the funniest, most joyous comedies to come along since the Greeks invented comedy.If you come from a family that eats, meddles, argues, laughs, kibbitzes and fights together, then go see this delightful comedy.Vardalos is amicable and sincere, but without the assembly of mutton-munching caricatures, this romantic-comedy would be hard pressed to fill a wedding gown. There is so much goodwill here, you are charmed as much as tickled into laughing.If viewers aren\\'t looking for anything remotely sophisticated and don\\'t mind the broad, repetitive comedy or potentially offensive stereotypes, they might just find themselves enjoying this lightweight film -- to some degree.A comfortable and comforting film with pep and heart and charm enough to overcome its simplicities and deficiencies.Despite its flaws, the movie leaves you feeling good, which is about all it aspires to.What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material.While this modest film certainly isn\\'t the equal of Monsoon Wedding in humor, insight or character development, it is fun.The comedy works thanks to Vardalos\\' plucky humor and a genial cast.A textbook example of how keeping it simple can yield big rewards -- and big laughs.The material is presented with so much warmth and affection, it\\'s almost impossible to resist.This is an affectionate and good-hearted movie that could\\'ve been a whole lot better and could\\'ve been a whole lot worse.A delectable confection.It uses an old-time formula, it\\'s not terribly original and it\\'s rather messy -- but you just have to love the big, dumb, happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding.A fun ride.The story feels stale and the characters ... sink too often to sketch-comedy stereotypes.It\\'s a rare treat when a film comes along that satirizes such a unique and passionate culture.Vardalos is ingratiating, but ultimately not distinctive enough to truly hold your interest.With its thin premise and stereotypical characters, a better title would have been A Big Fat Waste of Time.Feels like an extended pilot in search of a weekly TV slot.The movie is rigged for payoffs more linear than the Parthenon in its prime.It\\'s a buoyant comedy with more warmth and generosity of spirit than anything else in theaters right now.Vardalos apparently never met an ethnic stereotype she didn\\'t like, and she\\'s got a million of them.The beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor.It\\'s warm, sweet and funny fluff.Under Joel Zwick\\'s lackluster direction, the humor mostly comes across as too broad or simply flat.Warm-hearted in the way a movie can be when it knows its people inside out.Delivers a sugar rush without the calories.The avalanche of family ... is a hoot and a half.A robust romantic comedy filled with high spirits and a celebration of ethnicity.Unfunny standard-issue ethnic mix-\\'em-up.An amiable, offhanded comedy about ethnic identity and last-chance romance.The result is a rare delight: A romantic comedy that\\'s both deeply romantic and very funny.There\\'s such a good-natured heart beating beneath the cliches that it\\'s easy to appreciate the film\\'s willingness to poke gentle fun without a whiff of nastiness or judgment.Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick, it\\'s a sitcom without the snap-crackle.So good-natured and life-loving, and Vardalos\\' Toula is so quick-witted and adorable, that we have little problem understanding why Ian would want to get in on the fun.Tres Greek writer and star Nia Vardalos has crafted here a worldly-wise and very funny script.It looks more like a film designed for the small screen. But, like Toula, is has a good-natured personality.Vardalos\\'s parodies of Greek family values are loving and witheringly hilarious.Like Vardalos and Corbett, who play their roles with vibrant charm, the film, directed by Joel Zwick, is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can\\'t fake.An entertaining and good-spirited romance that celebrates the marvelous possibilities of life. Don\\'t be surprised if you find yourself dancing out of the theater.A comedy that, if not exactly a gutbuster, is one that is consistently charming, and that is due to the fresh voice and presence of writer/star Nia Vardalos.nannanIt\\'s simplistic to a fault and the humour is only slightly racier than a typical Saturday morning cartoon, but it does all of those things with effort and conviction.Benefits from a good voice cast, bright and beautiful animation, and very funny and charming moments. It still falls back into those traps you see in so many bad animated films...unnecessary dance sequences, the pop culture references and catchphrases that are two years to late and using real world music in a fantasy world of birds. The birds are cute, but an unambitious storytelling sans twists and turns, makes this bird-watching unexciting if not tedious. The screenplay lacks depth and so does the conflict between characters.If you\\'re an accompanying adult, be rest assured, there\\'s plenty of chuckles in it for you too. It\\'s a real egg-citing film....could have been worse. [Full review in Spanish]I\\'m sorry they couldn\\'t have relied more on the birdbrains at their disposal for a smarter story than a multimillion-dollar, volatile pun fest.Angry Birds could have been an unmitigated disaster, and it was a big relief to see that it didn\\'t even come close to that.It\\'s lushly animated, genuinely hilarious at times and even comes with the all-important message about speaking up for what you believe in.Would have been terrible even if it managed to come out during the period of time when society might have been interested in it. Instead, it\\'s both terrible and deeply pathetic.The film launches a barrage of avian and porcine puns, plus a flock of knowing pop-culture references... Most of these will fly right over the heads of younger viewers, but the film\\'s rambunctious silliness will go down a treat.So now even social apps are being turned into feature films? At this rate, should we expect Internet Meme: The Movie next?The Angry Birds Movie gets the job done, but there are strange tonal shifts here and a surprising amount of off-color jokes.The Angry Birds Movie is really not bad. It is actually very actively okay. The film has taken its bird-brained brand... and used it to construct characters and plots that are certainly serviceable, and possibly even inspired.The Angry Birds Movie is childish and occasionally cute and capitalises on the game\\'s once addictive popularity.It\\'s hardly anything about which to raise your eyebrows.Inside Out\" this is not... the most constructive outlet for anger is a violent bombing of the birds\\' adversaries, as if Ted Cruz\\'s foreign policy advisor wrote the screenplay.\\'Angry Birds\\' never really takes flight. Families of all ages deserve a lot better than this.Fitfully floppy - but Sony profits are flying high.A frenetic kids\\' film that is chock-full of madcap energy, throwaway sight gags and very silly puns, Angry Birds should most please those who are willing to relinquish their cynicism and go with the flow.Every ounce of The Angry Birds Movie is a mimicry and mockery of something greater that came before it. Not an instant classic, but it\\'s fun and enjoyable like an amusement park ride. [Full review in Spanish]It\\'s interesting how it incorporates the game dynamic into the story in a creative way. [Full review in Spanish]Kids deserve better than a long drawn out animated scene of a bald eagle urinating in to a lake that our characters just drank from moments ago.Sarcastically, subversively funny, and all set within a surprisingly creative universe where three-dimensionally fluffy birds inhabit turquoise beaches and wonky houses that make you think of Dr. Seuss by way of Montego Bay.Films based on video games have not set a very high bar in the past... The Angry Birds Movie is at least unlikely to ruffle your feathers or have you blowing up in anger.It could\\'ve been much, much worse, but that doesn\\'t necessarily mean it\\'s any good. [Full review in Spanish]It captures a lot of what\\'s so enjoyable about the mobile app, which is really all it needs to do.There\\'s not enough here for a full length feature film - something that becomes obvious the longer the movie is on the screen.It feels like something Dali would have dreamed up after imbibing a bottle of absinthe and choking on a ham sandwich.Despite fleeting moments of entertainment, The Angry Birds Movie comes across as a hollow viewing experience that doesn\\'t have much to offer - even for kids.When all is said and done, \"Angry Birds\" probably should have just been left in your pocket.While Pixar\\'s masterfulness is found in the subtlety of their approach, The Angry Birds Movie goes for broke in a more visceral approach, packing in pop culture references bound to go over any child\\'s head, no matter how precocious.Angry Birds could be gonzo; instead, it\\'s just kinda... there.Silly, frenetic, sometimes-crude \\'toon based on popular app.The plot is pretty simple. The real question is can it entertain the kids, and the answer depends on how receptive your children are to gyrating dance sequences set to covers of old pop standards.Movies based on video games continue to earn their wretched reputation, and I\\'m afraid The Angry Birds Movie won\\'t do anything to change that.I\\'ve never played the game. Hopefully it\\'s more fun. Not even Sean Penn\\'s grunts can save this stinker. Oddly targeted at younger viewers, many of whom may not have been the game\\'s first crop of power players, this animated feature could prove to introduce them birds to a whole new generation. Might not be the most original and novel way to convert a game and its characters into a movie, but it can be funny most of the time.Both children and adults will delight in the way the destruction of the pigs\\' island amplifies the joys of the original game. The effect is an amusing reversal of cultural recognition as the role of the icons expands through reproduction ...The Angry Birds Movie\" is about as filling as the game itself, and has little to say other than friendship is good, pigs are bad, and angry payback is best of all.Even though \\'Anger is not always the answer,\\' sometimes it has to be, or there\\'s no movie, and here\\'s where The Angry Birds Movie will divide audiences.Seeing an animated film in a theatre full of children and never hear them laughing is an indicator that something\\'s wrong. [Full review in Spanish]Parents will come out as angry as the titular birds of this one. [Full review in Spanish]Bright and cheerful, but under-plotted and overproduced. a chaotic yet amusing tale of animated avians battling plundering pigsThe game \"Angry Birds,\" at its core, is a destination for switching off your brain. And movies, even throw-away summer animated kid films, should aim for something more.The kids of today deserve better. So do I, come to think of it.Game over.Ticket buying adults shouldn\\'t just be angry, they should punch the filmmakers.The moral of Angry Birds is that it\\'s fine -- even necessary and virtuous -- to be angry, to rage, and to destroy. Have fun explaining that one to the kids.The Angry Birds Movie is exactly what one expects from a movie based on a video gaming app, and so much less.If the very idea of an Angry Birds movie feels about four years too late, know that it also has a joke about gluten.Overall the film\\'s a long play of a video game barely propped up by plot and stock personalities.Distinctly earthbound...neither bad enough to make you furious nor good enough to be memorable.After paying good money to take your family to see this film, you may be dealing with some anger-management issues of your own.I admit I fell victim to many a belly laugh watching The Angry Birds Movie. I loved Sudeikis\\' and Penn\\'s performances.The humor is all over the place. It\\'s a film that hopes that shaking a pig\\'s butt or drinking pee-filled water will get the easy laughs from the youngest viewers while the adults in the audience count the second until they can leave.Kids will revel in its bright, dumb fun, even if adults will be disappointed that its terrific ensemble weren\\'t given more to work with.An oppressive onslaught of noises and colors, occasionally punctuated by a joke.Again and again, Angry Birds returns to the well, assuming that imitating the way other cartoons look, or making a goofy noise, will cause something funny to just kind of happen.The Angry Birds Movie\" is unnecessary but cute, like a bonnet on a cat - and there are certainly worse recommendations than that.The occasionally amusing puns and over-talented voice cast don\\'t compensate enough for the meager story and the haphazard morals aimed at indiscriminating children.It\\'s an off-the-rack CGI-animated effort that wastes considerable vocal talent on a tired concept, only content to gift fans what they expect, and nothing more.Goes through familiar, harmless and occasionally amusing plot motions to explain why these birds are so angry, and why they\\'re perfectly justified in going bin Laden on buildings.Repackaged way past the time when the game was a peak obsession, this animated joyride is still an irresistible invitation to shake your sillies out. The movie\\'s story, by John Cohen, is pretty thin gruel, but Jon Vitti\\'s smart-aleck script can be quite funny, and the brightly colored animation is appealing.A entertaining story full of jokes and funny moments. [Full review in Spanish]Whereas you only needed a single finger to play the game, not one brain cell is required to process this busy, fizzy, empty-calorie calamity.The jaunty story has enough kinetic energy to keep young audiences engaged. And it remains truthful to the anarchic spirit of the game on which it is based.While it\\'s a disappointment compared to a lot of other animated films, it\\'s not entirely bad.The Angry Birds Movie\" is just fowl.The Angry Birds Movie is a lot of things, but none of them true to the app\\'s appeal.Irrelevant animated film that comes out when Angry Birds isn\\'t even popular anymore. [Full review in Spanish]It should come as no surprise that The Angry Birds Movie is a loud and dumb children\\'s film, but for what it\\'s worth, there are plenty of cinematic commercial ventures that are louder and dumber and so on than the well-meaning and slickly sold Birds.It\\'s not the worst thing out there, but the running time is too much and more than just curiosity doesn\\'t really hold up as a great movie. [Full review in Spanish][Angry Birds] proves to be more than just a gimmick, and doesn\\'t skimp on any of the quirky wackiness that you might expect from a film about blob-shaped, flightless birds battling pigs.Instead of elevating the Angry Birds concept to surreal heights of insane genius, the filmmakers settle for a tale bogged down by familiar themes plucked from much better films.It\\'s not entirely mindless fun on the level of the game, but it is just simple, goofy entertainment.Ultimately, The Angry Birds Movie does a decent job exploring the merits of anger. It\\'s no Inside Out, but it has heart and life, which isn\\'t too shabby for any film -- app or not....don\\'t take your children to sit and lose hour and a half of their lives you won\\'t get back. You\\'ve been warned. [Full review in Spanish]The Angry Birds Movie plays best to children who are easily entertained, but even they deserve better than this.There is still plenty of whimsy, colour and slapstick comedy present in The Angry Birds Movie to keep the adults relatively entertained and the kiddies -- who are more than likely to be the most entertained -- giddy with joy.What the heck is this? Some sort of meninist political statement attempting to vindicate male anger? In a kids\\' movie? Maybe men shouldn\\'t make movies...What \\'The Angry Birds Movie is about is better than how it\\'s about it.Never once transcends expectations, instead perpetuating our initial apprehensions related to the project....feels a little haphazard and undercooked...As a film, The Angry Birds Movie is an okay kids\\' flick, no more no less, but as a video game adaptation it is actually remarkably well done.For the record, my eight-year-old son gave it five stars.This simply isn\\'t funny enough to charm the parents of the film\\'s intended audience: impressionable and not particularly discerning children.A fast, funny, deliriously silly, breezy piece of animated folly - far too low-brow for Pixar, far too dragon-free for Dreamworks....A phone app turned into a fun family film? Makes you glad you lived this long.Pretty animation, weak jokes and a message that feels downright sinister. The humour thrives primarily off of the kookiness of its characters.The film is so random that it can\\'t help but get the audience laughing.I\\'m sure that playing the game for an hour is much more fun than this movie. [Full review in Spanish]It pulls off what has hitherto seemed an impossible feat: staying true to the spirit of the video game on which it was based, and simultaneously, breathing new life into the concept.The Angry Birds Movie has becomed what could easilly be a ver proftable movie franchise. [Fiull review in Spanish]The Angry Birds movie has a lot of poop jokes, fun, and pop culture references, but it does it going out of common places, which is something we can appreciate. [Full review in Spanish]This videogame adaptation is a little more than an acceptable family film. [Full review in Spanish]The Angry Birds franchise keeps growing and now it does so with splendid animation and the funny and explosive shennanigans of the characters of the game. [Full review in Spanish]It\\'s visually pleasing, but after the first minutes it becomes a dull and lifeless adventure that get tiresome quickly. [Full revew in Spanish]Jokes come thick and fast in a film that plays to the cheap seats but may bewilder the younger viewers at whom it\\'s presumably aimed.I laughed more during The Angry Birds Movie than I have at any film for a while.Animation veterans Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis ensure this Skittles-coloured universe is never less than zippy. But it\\'s the cast that makes the movie.The plot is rudimentary but the visuals are pleasing enough to get through some of the quieter patches.A freewheeling film that winds up celebrating the need to be true to yourself.We discover what made the phone app angry birds incandescent with rage in The Angry Birds Movie, repurposed for children in this cheerfully ironic adaptation.While this is strictly for kids, it\\'s bright, bold and soon, er, flies by.This is surprisingly fun, with loveable characters.An animated tale that\\'s a million miles from the irreverent brilliance of The Lego Movie, but mercifully still more than a bare-minimum cash grab.While it\\'s maybe more fun for spring chickens, The Angry Birds Movie does a lot with a flimsy premise.The Angry Birds Movie is quite good fun.A great videogame adaptation with zany humor and good animation. [Full review in Spanish]Pretty much meets egg-spectations of an absurd bird game plucked from an app and served up on the big screen.A collection of gags that come together in a feel good finale, rather than a cohesive story, The Angry Birds Movie still has its moments, some of which may have you chuckling for days.Adults won\\'t feel that angry at having seen it afterwards, while the little ones will be amused.Angry Birds is -- really sorry about this one -- a hoot.It\\'s buoyantly paced, and has just enough sincerity about its feathered society to keep you from sneaking glances down at WhatsApp.Pulling off a commendable movie version of the game was always going to be a difficult task, no matter how good the graphics or the one-liners. In the end, it\\'s the target audience that really matters.Whatever we might think of its broader implications, in the end, The Angry Birds Movie is basically a franchise extender that follows a predictable formula.A brash, sarcastic just-about-family-friendly adventure. ...About as entertaining as avian flu.While not quite on the level of The Lego Movie, this is an energetic and entertaining adventure that won\\'t ruffle the feathers of any dragged-along adults.The sheer contrived ridiculousness is part of the fun. But you really do have to know the game.A lighthearted and entertaining romp.Even when the feather-light plot gets into a freeform flap, the trade-off is an energised kind of knowing, anarchic playfulness: the sort that favours spewed-up bird food gags over vomit-inducing homilies.I got a chuckle out of the corny throw-away visual puns .. but much of the film seems too loud, too fast and too hard to follow for its target market of kiddies. Hell, it was tough for me, tooIt is cute and colourful, but a bit too crass - not withstanding its excellent animation and production elementsAs silly and disposable as the video game that inspired it -- but nowhere near as addictive -- \"The Angry Birds Movie\" is fitfully funny but tends towards a madcap mixture of comedy and action that never develops much forward momentum.The animation punches well above its weight with properly Looney Tunes-standard sight gags, polished, highly expressive character design, and rendering so intensely computed nearly every barbule and rachis on each individual feather is visible.The Angry Birds Movie is both the equivalent of a screaming five-year-old and a regressive piece of American propaganda.Let\\'s be clear, then: The Angry Birds Movie isn\\'t pointless because it\\'s based on an app. It\\'s pointless because it\\'s pointless.A fast, fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that, at its zenith, had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens.Treats its audience as a friend, inviting one and all to share in the fun; the dialogue, as atrocious as it is, is recited knowing wholeheartedly the very audience sharing the joke on the other side of the screen.A minor film on this sort of scale is always a major gesture.The Expendables is more than just your average action movie; it is the action movie of the year uniting the grittiness and soul of the old genre with the special effects and coolness of the new genre. See it.Trust me, [there\\'s] a scene you need to witness with a crowd that whoops and cheers, which is really what this film demands of its audience throughout.Some kind of meatheaded masterpiece, it\\'s cinematic junk food of the highest order. What The Expendables does right is it caters to its fans. It knows exactly what they want and it delivers a a pure, adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride with some great action.The action scenes are huge and excessively violent on a scale not seen since the closing scenes of Commando. At one point, in the absence of any buildings to detonate or ammunition depots to destroy, I think I saw an explosion explode.What we end up with is an incomprehensible, overly-long explosion-fest that could have easily been retitled \"A.D.D.: The Motion Picture.the kind of all-out, over the top action movie they just don\\'t make anymore, which is probably a good thing because the human brain can only take a movie that provides the equivalent to getting three consecutive adrenaline shots so many times.I like the idea of this movie much more than how it actually turned out.This has been clearly aimed at - pardon the pun - diehard action film fans. Anyone else, who might expect a vague sense of irony, will be sorely disappointed.... It\\'s a little like meeting up with old friends, only to come away deflated, realising you just don\\'t have that much to talk about any more.Stallone, with his highly unusual current face, is so busy making googly eyes at Statham and nursing a man-crush that he forgets that the goal of this movie is MORE KILLING.If you are a connoisseur of the Steven Seagal flavor of direct-to-DVD action film, seeing all these guys up on screen actually is a lot of fun. It doesn\\'t make it a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it\\'s still a lot of fun.The rest of the mayhem is simply ultraviolent, nonstop, and numbing. Better jokes might have helped.Unnatural but kind of remarkable.Provides a decent, if not totally fulfilling, fix of that something we miss.... a perfectly enjoyable mercenaries-on-a-mission-of-redemption adventure with a mix of testosterone-fueled camaraderie and this-time-it\\'s-personal seriousness.Suitable for a night of cold beer, chili, and a hot woman at your side...The film\\'s climax delivers and delivers and just keeps topping itself, making it possibly the most satisfying experience since cheeseburgers after a very big night.Final notes: this is a movie in which Dolph Lundgren is expected to convincingly portray a junkie and have an American accent. Also, Jet Li plays a character called Yin Yang. Do with this information what you will.If the plot line doesn\\'t leave you numb with disbelief, the excessive explosive outbursts and viscerally edited dismemberments will drop you, or someone you care about, wet in the seat.It\\'s fun to see this aging cast together on screen, but the movie is junk. The one-liners aren\\'t funny, the dialogue is tedious, and the action itself is prosaic and repetitive.How many actions stars does it take to get audiences into theaters? THIS many.The entertaining action scenes are as weighty and gnarly as the actors\\' grizzled mugs.Wow, I haven\\'t seen this much over-the-hill action since Don Ameche and Hume Cronyn did laps in Cocoon.The Expendables is admirable for bringing these actors all together, but shameful for not having the integrity to do anything of value with them.humble, subtle and restrainedWe can understand the need to have a support group for elderly action heroes who want to relive the glory years. But did they have to release it as a film? Unnecessary.Except for \\'youngster\\' Jason Statham, Stallone\\'s band of geriatric heroes are pretty creaky What we get is pure, unadulterated B-movie stuff, with an A-budget.The action sequences are terrific, the violence excessive. The guiltiest of guilty pleasures, then.Unless you\\'ve got a burning desire to see some old-timers trying to turn back the clocks and running around in a film they know in their heart-of-hearts is more at home on the small screen, wait for the DVD.Offers up neither clearly delineated characters nor any fundamental character of its own.That the supporting cast really needn\\'t have bothered showing up is the closest Stallone gets to a decent joke.Nothing exceeds like excess in The Expendables.Thick-necked and hollow-headed and weirdly affectingThe Expendables is like dating a jock - no sparkling conversation or subtlety but great to have around when you need to blow sh-t up or kick some ass.misses many opportunities to truly exploit its old-school ethos, instead falling into the trap of hyper-edited incoherenceSomething about the large scope of the action confounds Stallone, and his excessively large number of unit directors. It\\'s too hectic, too confusing to be cool, or exhilirating.Is it that big a deal to have a cast that includes Steve Austin, Randy Couture and Terry Crews? These guys would line up for a straight-to-DVD American Pie sequel if asked.Stallone\\'s dozens of remaining fans know exactly what to expect, and he gives it to them good and hard. Botched sensitivity aside, The Expendables delivers epic action.Not since Rocky worked out in a meat locker has Sylvester Stallone surrounded himself with so much aging beef.Stallone, never a clear speaker, spends most of his time grunting like a Gloucester Old Spot or barking like a sea lion with a sore throat.After repeated taunts to \"Bring it,\" increasing evidence of the barely-there story, and a war\\'s worth of bullets and fireballs, The Expendables gets pretty tiresome. It\\'s an A-grade cast all right, but there\\'s no escaping that this is a B-movie.Drenched in adrenaline, veiled in violence, \\'The Expendables\\' really is. Expendable, I mean.The worst action film of the year, and that\\'s saying something.In which a bunch of macho has-beens and never-weres splash down in the action pond for one last go-round.The movie struggles to find a main attraction that\\'s worth the bullets it\\'s printed on.Quit it with the CGI blood spurts. Exceeded my expectations as concerns dumbness -- and my expectations were high. This movie actually goes beyond being merely dumb; it\\'s more like the nirvana of dumbosity.... delivers exactly what the coming attractions promise - a lot of over-the-top action and silliness ...If you like watching men with no necks thumping each other, this could be your Citizen Kane.The only reason to watch this film is to see some of the world\\'s most famous action stars returning for one last bout of mayhem.A piece of sclerotic all-star machismo about as exciting as Veterans\\' Arm-Wrestling Night at the Hollywood Bowl.A film so unashamedly manly, it makes Fight Club look like the time they did Single Ladies on Glee.If you only see one action movie this year, see The Expendables -- twice.full review at Movies for the MassesIn lieu of a flurry of left hooks and roundhouse kicks, we stay safely in Stallone\\'s comfort zone of shoot \\'em ups and s--- getting blown up.[A] lumbering, aptly titled hulk of a movie.An unstoppable throwback to the days of Rambo and Commando; a time when heroes cracked wise, shat bullets, and blew-up a thousand faceless enemies before breakfast.We want to remember. We want to revel. We want to watch things explode. Stallone only understands one of these things. So yes, there will be explosions.defensive and frankly more than a little patheticIt looks like most of the money spent in this project went to explosions, which are many and huge, and to acting salaries, at the expense of special effects and the script, which could have used a big upgrade.Watching The Expendables is like watching professional wrestling but with guns, knives and a whole lot of death.Flawed, but the action scenes are as violent, ridiculous and over the top as you could hope for.Big guns, big hats, big motorcycles, big trucks. There is obviously more being projected here than just a movieStallone\\'s boasted that he\\'s made the drunk uncle of all dumb action movies and in several ways he hasWhatever film you\\'ve imagined...is better than what the film actually is.An overly-hyped exercise, a cynical attempt to couple recognizable action stars with their respective muscles onscreen ... think of this not so much a film but, rather, steroid abuse of a whole other kind.Glories in over-the-top, testosterone-driven action and an ensemble whose names I only expected to hear when I died and went to B-movie heaven. If only The Expendables\\' script was as divine as its roll call.There\\'s a lot in this nostalgic Sylvester Stallone actioner that lives up to its title - the recycled plot, the forgettable characters, the monotonous violence - but it\\'s an undeniable kick to see these vets in action.With only a couple of artistic virtues and even fewer moral attributes to its credit...\"The Expendables\" is wretched.Despite some surprisingly decent performances, it just isn\\'t as fun as it should be. But Stallone does prove there\\'s still some room left in the action genre for these titans, so let\\'s why not? Let\\'s have another round.For diehard action fans the explosions and car chases will be enough but for those looking for strong characters and plot development it will be lacking.It passes for an average Stallone film, which doesn\\'t quite make it a good pic even though it\\'s not exactly a bad pic.Too bad this blast-from-the-past mucho macho male reunion movie is so absurdly incoherent.It\\'s like being in Stallone\\'s head watching his stream of consciousness manifest.Jean-Claude van Damme and Steven Seagal will be kicking themselves - or perhaps each other - for having turned Stallone down.It\\'s one of those movies best watched on DVD or Blu-ray where you can fast-forward any time you see someone open their mouth to talk.What you will find is both familiar in its contours and unique in its casting.It\\'s not the age of the actors that makes The Expendables expendable. It\\'s the stale storytelling.An awful screenplay, horrible acting, and all action - fisticuffs, gun fights, car chases, etc. - is badly edited. It\\'s a terrible movie. I loved every cliche-filled minute. It\\'s all as dumb as mud, but it\\'s familiar and comfortable enough to entertain on a basic level.The Expendables isn\\'t as much fun as it should be.I\\'s a bit like a trip to the gym on a flat tire. The advertising materials... carry just the right kind of gleeful, confident attitude -- but sadly, Stallone\\'s actual movie is a giant mess and a wasted opportunity.The closest a real-life movie has ever gotten to \"Seinfeld\"\\'s \"Death Blow.\" Sylvester Stallone\\'s gun-emptying, blade-tossing, clandestine action flick \"The Expendables\" is great fun. Sure, this declaration comes with caveats, but do you really need to hear them?If ever there was a movie that was all about the action scenes, The Expendables is it.The world has changed since Rambo and Arnold held sway, which isn\\'t the film\\'s fault. But it\\'s going to be held accountable anyway.Also the Predictables, the Forgettables and they kinda look like the Anabolic Steroidables...The Expendables delivers a series of macho encounters within the team of expert killers and pointedly named hard-asses.If you accept The Expendables for what it is -- Stallone having some simple, stupid fun -- you may be surprised to find yourself joining him.There\\'s nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure. We all have them: Those movies that we know suck that we can\\'t help but watch on cable every time they come on. But they still SUCK. Bullets, knives and bare hands fly in an incomprehensible vortex as arms and heads and body parts get thrown into the melee.Stallone is a terrible action director. Sequences are visually incoherent, chopped-up, sloppy, vague. You\\'d think that in all the years he\\'s spent in this racket he would\\'ve learned how to cobble together stuff like this.Hulk like \\'Expendables.\\' It SMASH. Guns go BANG-BANG. Things go BOOM. Fire EVERYWHERE. Cars crash and make even MORE FIRE. HA-HA-HA. Hulk no like Rourke, though. Rourke NUTS.The Expendables should have been the greatest action movie ever made. Unfortunately, the film is a bit underwhelming. Luckily, Crews and Statham save the day.There\\'s no one to blame but Stallone for action sequences that degenerate into incoherence, to the point where it\\'s impossible to know who\\'s truck is exploding and who\\'s shooting at whom.While Stallone\\'s film won\\'t win any Oscars, it gives off a dopey genre high that\\'s hard not to catch.Given the similarities between the two films -- the muddled fight scenes, the occasional one-liners, the over-the-top violence, used to camouflage the narrative weaknesses -- this easily could have been titled Rambo V.This is truly a movie that nobody needs -- gratuitously savage, implausible and sometimes incoherent.Occasionally fun in its over-the-top mindlessness; the fun just never lasts more than a couple minutes at a time.A down and dirty action adventure, and the best escapist entertainment around. Check your brain at the door for non-stop rowdy, riotous and raucous fun. As with Rambo, we get bullets that cause heads to literally explode. That should have been the tone all along, but Stallone just can\\'t let his movie be terrible enough to be entertaining. When The Expendables revs up and becomes the loud, explosive machismo parade that it\\'s meant to be, it works. But when it doesn\\'t, it\\'s rather abysmal.But that feeling quickly disappears thanks to the movie\\'s awfulness, and by the time it was over the only excitement I still felt was the supreme joy of finally being able to leave the theatre and head back home.It pretty much fits the bill -- maybe not directed with any particular verve or wit by Stallone, but still satisfactory of the lowest common denominators and the highest possible decibel levels.Like the Gosford Park of bad acting, this is one throwback that should have been thrown back.The whole enterprise is a tremendous wasted opportunity. Even the title knows it.Among the explosions and the blood, a forceful melancholy infects the characters and puts a dark tinge to even the most jocular banter.Feels less like high-concept filmmaking and more like wishful thinking.The fights are so many and so long and the cuts so quick that you can rarely tell who\\'s winning. One thing is certain, the losers are the viewers.Friends may not let friends die alone, but bogus philosophizing is apparently business as usual.Alas, little money was left over to fund the screenplay, which is unbelievably bad given the level of talent involved.You certainly can\\'t say this over-the-top thriller skimps on action. The final third or so is wall-to-wall brawling, shootings and explosions.These action heroes take their fun seriously without taking themselves seriously. While you may have trouble figuring out who\\'s running where in the film\\'s big climax, Stallone sets off enough explosions to ensure their Brazilian shooting location could be seen from space.best action film of the summerThe audiences for whom \\'The Expendables\\' represents a wish belatedly fulfilled aren\\'t expecting Shakespeare, but Stallone, once an Oscar-nominated screenwriter, is strictly on autopilot here. Delivers pretty much exactly what its audience wants and expects: big, dumb, campy fun so deliriously, comically macho, it\\'s remarkable that no one in the cast died of testosterone poisoning. It\\'s willfully out of date, like an aging hair band that can\\'t pack away the spandex.Borrows liberally from such male-bonding classics as Robert Aldrich\\'s The Dirty Dozen and Sam Peckinpah\\'s The Wild Bunch, but offers not a whiff of the tragic fatalism and astute critique of machismo that inform those superior dramas.It yawningly snaps into place as yet another series of explosions that are dressed up with no place to blow.The film bulls-eyes so-bad-it\\'s-sad from the get-go. The precision with which it just keeps hitting that unwanted target is spooky.... what winds up in the picture\\'s largely lazy grasp is largely evidence of the influence of, well, any number of cheap and often straight-to-video testosterone fests.Expendables is the closest thing to movie Viagra yet invented. It\\'s reprehensible. It\\'s stoopid violent. It\\'s a lot of unholy fun.Unfortunately, there\\'s a limit to the effectiveness of this kind of influence.The big set piece at the end is impressive...proving that Stallone really is a formidable action director. It is just a pity it takes so long to get there. It\\'s a contender for the manliest movie ever made.As an opportunity for giant lunkheads to knock each other around and blow things up, The Expendables is considerably more fun than the last Transformers movie.Is it fun? Sort of. But it shoulda coulda been a ton of fun.When it gets around to the righteous fightin\\' and killin\\' bits, The Expendables more than delivers on its promise to be the manliest movie ever made.It\\'s not just the characters who are expendable: The actors may as well be tossed out with the garbage, too.Sure, it\\'s fun, after a fashion, to see them all in the same place, kicking and creaking. But that\\'s about all it is.A throat-slashing, elbow-dropping, grenade-throwing, trigger-pulling, and limb-dismembering good time.The shootouts are epic, but the stuff leading up to them is lame.Inevitably, the film culminates in a nearly wordless bloodbath with a death every few seconds, plunging onward like the world\\'s longest drum solo.The body count is enormous, the explosions deafening, and none of it makes sense -- so why did I find this such a guilty pleasure?Stallone encourages a pure bath of brutality, sans winks. It\\'s up to the viewer to decide if this is all disgusting overkill or the cinematic equivalent of a firm erection.As for Stallone, he grimaces purposefully in his El Greco beard, and he keeps the body count coming so that it sates you like a junk-food craving fulfilled.Give me Bradley Cooper driving a tank in mid-air, any day.The thought behind this body-splattering nostalgia trip is unformed and stagnant.The Expendables is third-rate.This is action as timeless as the reptilian brain.Fathers, don\\'t let your sons grow up without The Expendables.Taken as a whole, The Expendables is a disappointment, and a frustrating one at that.The Expendables is preaching to the choir, but that choir will surely lap it up with relish.Gratuitous explosions, fight scenes and macho stars past and present, this is the pick of this year\\'s cluttered action crop.The Expendables is savage yet inert, and breathtakingly sleazy in its lack of imagination.I\\'d say that I already can smell the sequel, but I believe that odor is coming from this film.Stallone vs. Hugo Chavez? C\\'mon, the general wears the very same trademark fatigues and red beret, and heads a Latin American country beginning with a \\'V\\' and ending with an \\'A\\'. While the former overturns papaya carts and terrorizes donkeys.Stallone and crew deliver a hard-hitting, unrepentant action extravaganza.Lean, mean, funny, and chockablock with fast-twitch demolition spectacle, \"The Expendables\" represents a grand finale for several generations of action cinema stars. Sly Stallone has corralled the meanest, toughest action actors he could find and pooled them into a turbo-charged Dirty Dozen movie. With laughs.It\\'s raining bullets and knives in this macho action thriller in which brute force rules supreme. It\\'s a bitter pill to swallow, but it\\'s a dark day indeed when a film can bring together so many promising elements and, when the curtains close, leave you wondering exactly what the heck you just sat through -- and if you even enjoyed it at all.It\\'s not particularly well made, but the patchiness only adds to the considerable goodwill and charm the movie carries.The gun show is in full effect in The Expendables, an old school action ensemble tailor made for our nostalgic times.One shouldn\\'t knock the plotting for being distinctly old-school, but criticism deserves to be levelled at the manner in which so much talent is squandered.It\\'s filled with literally explosive excitement. Stallone\\'s retro actioner is a cheesy, schlocky anachronistic flick, sort of a class reunion of the genre\\'s stars of the past two decades.A bunch of guys past their prime punching and kicking each other and pretending its for our benefit, when its really just one last self-congratulatory hurrah.The body count is high and the personalities click in this old-school testosterone fest.Take the cast away, and there\\'s not much more here than the straight-to-DVD schlock that has kept conspicuously absent rivals Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme busy of late.nannanOn one hand the movie is a game, a conscious display... of Spielberg\\'s technical mastery; on the other it reaches toward what might be prophecy, or passionate allegory, or exhortation to mindfulness of real human suffering.The story is affecting, the action scenes are thrilling, the issues are resonant. An unstoppable juggernaut of action and anxiety that will have you blundering from the cinema in a state of nervous exhaustion. Don\\'t expect any soft drink promotional tie-ins with this summer blockbuster.War of the Worlds is that most rare of screen adaptations - a film that is faithful to its origins and at the same time, its own separate creature. The first half is better than the second, but what a first half.Alien invasion thriller too scary for young kids.so impressive in so many ways that it makes the frustration over its miserable final moments that much harder to bear...in its own right it works well enough most of the time to pass an entertaining couple of hours.An exciting, intense, gruesome, and awfully subversive piece of science fiction escapism...See it, but lower your expectations.great flick from spielbergSpielberg blows stuff up better than anyone -- he proves himself the maestro of that by-now-degraded game.Just when it seemed like Mr. Spielberg might be maturing into a filmmaker with some much-needed cynicism, you realize he\\'s still just out there rounding up the dollars.Spielberg flips the E.T. script with this sci-fi flick which reverts to the pulp fiction notion of aliens as the enemies of earthlings.Reconfirms Spielberg as a master of action, here seamlessly integrating spectacular visual magic into the most mundane and familiar settings.Like disasters in real life, the film hits you in the gut with a vision of catastrophe, and leaves you to sort out what it all means.Spielberg creates an alien invasion movie that can be labelled the antithesis to the likes of Independence Day or the ilk. The reason? The personal perspective.The film is dark and bleak with little real sense of wonder--the thing that should be Spielberg\\'s forte.click to read review [Greek]The film succeeds as pure sensation, an exacting distillation of fear.Steven Spielberg\\'s War of the Worlds is huge and scary, moving and funny-another capper to a career that seems like an unending succession of captivations.Rarely has the term \\'Hollywood ending\\' been quite as appropriate, and seldom has a denouement of that nature come so close to tainting all that came before.Spielberg\\'s Worlds is filled with terrific scenes but ultimately, he draws the film to a predictable and utterly disappointing conclusion.A basic rule of thumb is - if you see Tim Robbins, you\\'ve stayed too long.There likely won\\'t be a more gripping film this year than Spielberg\\'s War Of The Worlds, which at its best glides along like choreography with a camera, slowly parsing out information while shrouding the rest in shadow and suggestion.[A]s much a disaster movie as it is a straight sci-fi horror film ... there are very good performances in the film ... but the movie leaves you feeling let-down and quarrelsome. I liked it a lot, aside from the ending, which made me want to burn down the theater.Just as Jaws made us fear the water, WOTW makes us wary of the weather. You\\'ll never again look at lightning in quite the same way.An adrenaline pumping disaster movie told within the context of a small scale family drama ... is an entertaining thrill ride.All summer blockbusters should be as loud and scary -- and deliver -- like this. Until its final act, the film is lean and alive, a visceral thrill ride designed to move audiences to the edge of their seats or maybe into their parents\\' laps. War of the Worlds shows that Steven Spielberg remains one of the best shooters in Hollywood.The narrative miscalculation is extraordinary and ruinous to the extent that I can\\'t conjure an example of a similarly enjoyable movie being beheaded so efficiently.War of the Worlds is thoughtful, but don\\'t let that worry you. This is an action film concerned more with delivering thrills than making bold statements.WotW is a great film and entertainment that can be taken seriously; Shyamalan and Emmerich must be quietly shaking their fists, realizing he still does it better.Overall, the film is too lacking in feeling to provide a recognizably human experience.The movie is the anti-Independence Day; the aliens are kicking our butts and we can\\'t do anything but wait for our turn to become kibble.It\\'s worth every penny.... A visual and technical achievement, but underwhelming on every other level.It doesn\\'t work as a science fiction epic, it doesn\\'t work as a tale of families bonding in the face of tragedy, and it certainly doesn\\'t work as a mingling of the two.You don\\'t think a walking tripod can be scary?Don\\'t expect Reese\\'s Pieces or mashed potatoes to be on the menu in Spielberg\\'s shock-and-awesome version of Wells.It\\'s a thrilling ride...[but] this bountiful pot of signifiers leaves a caustic aftertaste. A thrilling but frivolous ride.War of the Worlds is taut, gripping and surprisingly dark filmmaking.I just thought it was unrealistic when they killed the aliens with a chemical imbalance, because we all know there\\'s no such thing as a chemical imbalance.Spielberg remains the consummate storyteller, even if the material he has chosen to work with simply doesn\\'t pack the emotional wallop of a \"Schindler\\'s List\"......an impressive display of sound and fury that falls apart the minute any scrutiny is applied to the machinations of its plot.War, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing but a good couple of hours at the theater.What hurts it is Spielberg\\'s dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middle-brow meditations on the travails of the middle-class family.Whether it represents filmmaking at its most opportunistic or most empathic will be up to each viewer to decide, but there\\'s no denying its potency as a harrowing thrill ride.Imagine Jurassic Park handled with the sorrow and doom of Schindler\\'s List. It\\'s the most terrifying movie in ages.Bewildered, mildly optimistic, holding out the hope of salvation in spite of everything in a blasted, empty landscape, War of the World is, in the end, and perhaps despite its intentions, a fairly tentative assertion of hope for the future.Surprisingly dark for a blockbuster and delivers handsomely in terms of thrills and special effects.If you\\'ve seen Independence Day, then you\\'ve seen War of the Worlds.War of the Worlds is pure popcorn escapism of the highest order if you want it to be, or more, but it\\'s never less than thrilling.War of the Worlds is a terrifying potential vision of our own self inflicted doomsday, masquerading as a summer blockbuster.Spielberg has crafted a genuinely traumatic summer event movie, one that gives us images of violence and destruction of often devastating emotional weightAn intense sci fi experience that should satisfy viewers who crave both expensive special effects and intimate human drama, assuming that such an audience exists.As it is, I admire the brilliance of the majority of this picture to no-end; it\\'s just that pesky literal ending I walked out wanting to declare war on.Almost every moment of War of the Worlds is heart-racing, jaw-dropping, knuckle-biting, date-grabbing adrenaline.The real strength of the film is how closely Spielberg welds it to Ray and his family.The story may be sci-fi, but the product is a horror film, plain and simple: a brilliantly constructed scaring machine.It\\'s as if the aliens landed and everyone died so that Tom Cruise could grow up one more time.War of the Worlds ends too abruptly, running out of juice just as the aliens do. Even on summer popcorn terms, it\\'s a tepid finish to a movie that, for its first hour or so, taps so expertly into our fears.[B]y far the biggest, loudest and most elaborate adaptation of the H.G. Wells classic.Spielberg\\'s list of great movies is too long to catalog here, but rest assured: War of the Worlds now ranks among them.Spielberg as Hobbesian; Wells as eugenicistHow refreshing to see Spielberg rock the boat with nothing more shocking than pure old-fashioned fear\\'...director Steven Spielberg has brought the story to this generation. And it is a story meant for this time.\\'\\'I\\'m the pre-teen Maggie Smith,\\' says Dakota Fanning, \\'if Maggie Smith had a stripper name.\\' ...Spielberg has a genius for ... audience adulationIt\\'s really amazing how much pathos is generated while there\\'s nothing on screen but violence and mass panic.falls way short on ideas, character development, and creative wondermentYou could do a whole lot worse if you\\'re looking through generic science fiction or disaster movies, but Steven Spielberg\\'s standards are usually much higher than this.Ho hum story, generic fireworks.The man who gave human dimension to the effects of holocaust in Schindler\\'s List has now prostituted human extermination for entertainment. Bread and circuses, indeed.People will nit-pick at the plot and the script... but you can\\'t look at what Spielberg has put together in the first two-thirds of this film and not be humbled and amazed.Only a master film-maker could squeeze white-knuckle terror out of an old war-horse like H.G. Wells\\' \"War of the Worlds.What comes next is a prolonged look at unthinkable devastation, structured as one family\\'s troubled dynamics.This sense of constant anxiety is the most potent effect of the film.Spielberg seldom gives Cruise, not to mention the audience, a break from the unstoppable peril of merciless invasion.Forget the story and go for the ride. \\'War of the Worlds\\' is a great summer thriller.It may be no coincidence the president\\'s poll numbers and the movie industry\\'s ticket sales are both in a slump: Doom-and-gloom scenarios are playing out offscreen and on...The good parts are really good and the bad parts are really bad.War of the Worlds confronts the West\\'s collective feelings of vulnerability but at the same time it reassures our potential for survival.Never Before Has Spielberg so Tragically Shot Himself in the Foot with his Ending and Never before have I been so Willing to Forgive.Most of the film is utterly terrifying. On that level, Spielberg has succeeded totally....Where the film runs into problems is in the overall pacing and structure.There\\'s not much plot, depth or character development, but it more than makes up for it in relentless intensity and consistency of vision.Generates chills through eerie, ambient sounds, slow-panning camera shots and pants-pissingly scared characters . . . a nerve-gripping, full-throttle rollercoaster ride.For all its technical beauty, there\\'s something lacking. It often feels a bit like Spielberg phoned the film in or at the very least painted it by numbers.[A] shockingly unimaginative remake.The imagery is startling not just for its symbolic resonances, but for the breathless intensity with which it sears the screen.The screenplay ... is more intimate, eschewing a worldwide coverage of the invasion. This concept makes the calamity more immediate, more personal.Pitched at a level of interpersonal experience amid the mayhem, this blockbuster offers no sense of loss. Given its ending, you\\'d think the power had been out for a few days.Spielberg directs his early scenes with a vigorous and absolute sense of terror. The moment two youngsters appear more frightening than attacking aliens, you can\\'t help suspecting there\\'ll be additional moviemaking trouble ahead. And you\\'re right.My recommendation is tempered by the fact that this started off as a great movie and ended as little more than a piece of pleasant fluff.an awesome summer movie that showcases a director and some actors at the top of their games.... the inventor of the summer blockbuster directing the biggest movie star on the planet... It\\'s big, it\\'s loud, and it\\'s what you expect an \"event\" film to be.A sure-footed thrill ride with more suspense and spine-tingling scares than a Tom Cruise publicity junket.Let Cruise rant and jump on furniture all he wants. So long as he can churn out movies like this one, he\\'s free to make a fool of himself all he wants.A Brick-breaking, glass-shattering, emotion-grabbing first half, stalls, then tailspins into a complete mess. Ending is as bad as the openning is good.We watch as neighborhoods and hordes of innocents are decimated, and the way it\\'s shot - close in, with shaky, handheld cameras - makes you feel every death.Everybody wins with \"War of the Worlds,\" a fast-paced summer blockbuster that will appeal to action, sci-fi and drama fans.Be prepared for long intervals of holding your breath, because this is the real deal.War of the Worlds may not stand up well to careful inspection and it may not be the smartest science fiction film brought to the screen, but it is an intense, visceral experience.An unwieldy hodgepodge of spectacular set pieces and sappy family drama.The balancing act between pleasing crowds and evoking larger human truths eventually escapes Spielberg\\'s grasp, as it has occasionally in the past.Good-naturedly bludgeons its audience with old-fashioned alien-invasion hysteria.War of the Worlds is an attack-of-the-aliens disaster film crafted with sinister technological grandeur -- a true popcorn apocalypse.Extravagant in movie terms but stingy in emotional ones, it embodies all of Spielberg\\'s bad impulses and almost none of his good ones.War of the Worlds\\' is a picture without a thought in its pretty head: the Tom Cruise movie to end all Tom Cruise movies.An important film.Meticulously detailed and expertly paced and photographed, with sights so spectacular and terrible that viewers will have to consciously remind themselves to close their mouths when their jaws drop open.Technically flawless but not especially moving.With the power of Spielberg and Cruise behind it, the sinister and tense War of the Worlds is this summer\\'s blockbuster to beat them all.It\\'s on the road that War of the Worlds makes the jump from thrilling to frequently unpleasant, as Spielberg burdens the movie with Holocaust imagery and commentary about terrorism and wars of occupation.Urgent and pungent.As powerful a filmmaker as he is, Spielberg, with approximately two dozen features under his belt, remains a work in progress as a storyteller.Its exploitation of tragic iconography -- just to amp up the screams, tug some tears and sell a few more million movie tickets -- should be deplored.This is one genuinely scary, disturbing movie.Spielberg shows that he remains the master of the form he virtually invented.When it comes to searing and iconic visual imagery, Spielberg is still the best filmmaker around.Steven Spielberg\\'s War of the Worlds is a close encounter of the blurred kind, an orchestration of chaos and panic and destruction as visceral as it can get.In terms of sheer spectacle alone, War of the Worlds is a winner. If this movie doesn\\'t help stop or turn around the box-office slide of the past few months, then Hollywood really is in big trouble.It\\'s the movies\\' ultimate disaster epic: a genuinely unsettling movie experience that uses the new technology to create an alien invasion of unprecedented scale and realism.Spielberg is pretty much incapable of making a terrible movie anymore. But he has plainly forgotten a lot of what makes a good popcorn movie since his Jurassic period. Where\\'s the fun?This disappointing War of the Worlds limps to a conclusion that mercifully insures there will not be a sequel.In the first two acts, the movie is rousing summer fare.Fantastic and banal, terrifying and occasionally dull, pure Spielberg and yet at times anonymous, War of the Worlds delivers multiple viewing experiences during its two-hour running time....the film\\'s only sublime moments happen in scenes where the population gets blown up.War of the Worlds is the kind of movie Spielberg can make in his sleep, which may be why it feels like we are sleepwalking while watching it.Much is destroyed in Steven Spielberg\\'s War of the Worlds, but the movie never quite delivers an emotional knockout blow.In his latest science-fiction epic, director Steven Spielberg shows he\\'s better at blowing up the world than anyone else alive. Unfortunately, he also shows he has no idea how to put the world back together.This is B-movie material all the way, yet it\\'s not only watchable, it\\'s engrossing. That\\'s because the material is in the hands of an A-talent director, who knows, as few of his contemporaries do, how to manipulate the plastic qualities of a film.Wow, indeed.In the second half of the film, the wind starts to go out of Spielberg\\'s sails.War of the Worlds can be a nightmarish trip, but it\\'s a terrific film, a blockbuster that lives up to its billing.A first-class pop entertainment packed to the brim with astounding effects and near-non-stop action and suspense.War of the Worlds pushes some of the right buttons and enough of the wrong ones to make you wish that Spielberg would move on from aliens already and use his unparalleled talents to focus once more on earth....wowing enough to silence rude, modern movie audiences in their seats.The real hero of this film is Steven Spielberg. It\\'s not the best Spielberg film out there, but there are pieces of it that are truly monumental.[Spielberg is] in absolute visual, physical command of this material, presenting the complete chaos and destruction with frightening clarity.War is a blast.The ending fizzles... war should end in a victory that you can feel superior about and celebrate. It\\'s close, but this encounter didn\\'t rock my world.Earth goes to war, but Spielberg merely goes back to his aging bag of tricks.THE definition of escapist summer movie and a triumph for director Spielberg. It is a stunner and a half.Spielberg and his team are master filmmakers, and it\\'s a pleasure to see them work[A] wonder of contemporary, big-budget Hollywood filmmaking -- it\\'s its own antithesis at the same time it\\'s a stunning example of it.Delivering much more than a sci-fi extravaganza for the age of terrorism, Spielberg keeps us rooting for a family facing danger from without and distress from within.The title of the film is misleading. This is not a film about war. This is a movie about extermination.W.o.w.Make E.T. a bad dude whose momma never loved him and we\\'re talking real scorched-earth policy here ... These guys are dividers, not uniters.The first two acts are overpowering specimens of effects-amped, screen-incinerating hysteria.It\\'s refreshing for a change to see an apocalyptic vision that doesn\\'t include shots of prominent world monuments being obliterated.May give the kids nightmares but it won\\'t turn on your \\'heartlight\\'.Some of the director\\'s finest thriller-style work in years.There\\'s plenty of blood, most of the cast of thousands die, and some of the images are just plain disturbing...I loved it.Stunning. ... Fanning gives such an authentic portrayal of a terror-stricken child that you might want to call Family Services on her behalf.May be the most efficiently built engine of escalating terror you will ever encounter. But Spielberg\\'s technique serves no purpose this time except the visceral.The destruction is so vivid and quick, and the CGI looks so real that somewhere Independence Day is whimpering in the corner. Almost good enough to make you forget its director is an overrated egomaniac and its star is a self-righteous nut.[O]nce you get over your initial sense of awe at the special effects, you\\'re left with the feeling that you\\'re being hit over the head repeatedly....while his \"War\\'s\" waging, Spielberg will have you by the throat. Unsatisfying combination of freeze-dried family troubles and enormous, thudding monsters... The flat finale... manages to somehow be syrupy and cheesy at the same time.What - what - have they created here? Really folks, I\\'m at a loss...Answers the question: How does a working-class guy handle an alien invasion, destruction of Earth, and disrespectful kids? Spielberg effortlessly centres on the human drama amid the astounding imagery. So it\\'s a pity the adaptation of HG Wells\\' classic novel becomes so contrived.Even hostile invasions need a bit more character and plot development.An unending heart -pounding; adrenalin pumping; sweaty palms inducing ride . It\\'s what summer movies should be like. A problematic blockbuster with one essential saving grace: It\\'s profoundly frightening in a way that few directors have the talent to capture.Worlds makes for one of the strangest and bleakest productions ever to market itself as summertime movie entertainment.It makes Independence Day look like The Muppet Movie.A disturbing account of Earth being thrown into the fan from a master filmmaker ready to take the darkness of our existence to places we may not be ready to confront.War of the Worlds takes one of our deepest global fears, the threat of annihilation, and gives us a catharsis when humanity reasserts itself.Has all the mechanized ingenuity of one of those dazzling Tripods, but the bigger they are....it\\'s the gutless ending that renders War of the Worlds most insulting.War of the Worlds does what it was made to do: Entertain.Leave it to Steven Spielberg to turn the end of the world into a treatise on responsible parenting.the greatest alien invasion movie everThe images are fresh and imaginative and yet perfectly believable, mixing the normal with the inconceivable,War of the Worlds is a big, clunky movie containing some sensational sights but lacking the zest and joyous energy we expect from Steven Spielberg.Overlooking a disappointing conclusion, War of the Worlds is a marvelous entertainment of imagination, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and surprising thoughtfulness.Event movies as brilliantly executed as War of The Worlds come by very, very rarely indeed. Easily one of the finest disaster movies of all time.This anti-Close Encounters is a spectacular technical exercise, but in the final analysis it\\'s as loud and soulless a piece of equipment as the aliens\\' Tripod Death Stars.Spectacle filmmaking of the highest order.Drawbacks aside, with War of the Worlds, Hollywood is calling on Spielberg to deliver this summer\\'s blockbuster, and he accomplishes the task. The movie is solid all the way around, and Spielberg\\'s touches are everywhere.Steven Spielberg\\'s meticulous, thrilling and chilling War of the Worlds is a testimony to tension.Golly, is it too much to expect more character dimension than this from the director of \"Schindler\\'s List\"?War of the Worlds is easily the most bone-chillingly scary movie Spielberg has made, but it also taps into an unsettling kind of fear that never goes for the cheap thrill. The dread Spielberg conjures is horribly personal.Spielberg seems to have resigned himself to the fact that he\\'ll never match the impact of the radio show, but he\\'s making no bones about going after that FX Oscar.Spielberg is the only one who can mess up a Spielberg film.It\\'s the human struggle that makes this a sci-fi masterpiece.When the guy who made Saving Private Ryan uses the word \\'war\\' in a title, audiences should believe him. War of the Worlds is brutal.Steven Spielberg returns to the scary territory of Jaws and Jurassic Park and once again proves himself to be the most gifted movie entertainer of his generation.We knew Spielberg had action chops, but didn\\'t know he had this in him. This anti-E.T. is so rigorously realized it makes Independence Day look like Finding Neverland.Tom Cruise gives one of his most intense performances, and the visual effects have enough high-tech power to make an army of interstellar invaders cringe.When it\\'s in full throttle, there\\'s not been and probably won\\'t be a better action movie out there this summer.A gritty, intense and supremely accomplished sci-fier about some distinctly unbenign alien invaders.War of the Worlds makes A.I. look like it ends well. If Jurassic Park was Jaws with claws, War of the World is E.T. gone bad, a big, noisy, scary sci-fi with dazzling technology that overwhelms the simplistic story and personaeIt\\'s a rare thing -- a summer movie that demands to be taken as a serious emotional experience.a roller-coaster of special effects as Ray and his family escape from ever more hair-raising dangers in ever more improbable, but oddly fun ways.Spielberg has not only touched the nerve of the American psyche, he has ripped it out, stomped on it and beat it with a club for a full two hours. This is the doomsday hour...inspires the same jaw-dropping awe as Jurassic Park and Close Encounters both did with the same mix of fantasy, horror, and the regular guy.Complete nightmare fertilizerThe flick is undeniably fun and Spielberg\\'s dusted off magic still works.Cruise and Fanning give Oscar-caliber performances. The special effects are mind-boggling. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film if you forget the silly Hollywood ending. A piece of perfectly realized, pure entertainment.If you like heart attacks with your movie-nights out, then sign yourself up for the war.War of the Worlds is, hands down, the best big budget film of the summer. Maybe the year. Spielberg has crafted a real classic.nannannannannanThe situations in this sitcom never get as funny as they should. You, Me and Dupree is an inconsistent trifle - by turns cute and annoying - and not much more.Not a single laugh hereThe film is a mishmash of half-baked jokes, sitcom scenarios and Owen Wilson attempting to float by on his charm.This is one of the worst scripts in the history of major-studio motion pictures: inconsistent, undeveloped, predictable, poorly thought-out -- hopeless on every level.Owen Wilson just does what he does, and allows you to take it or leave it. You, Me and Dupree, then, suffers a slow start and trades too frequently in broad, garish strokes before rallying with some late atypical turns.Wilson goes from crashing weddings to crashing newlyweds in a comedy that\\'s as tired as week-old wedding cake.An oddly likeable film that grows on you if you\\'re willing to stick with it. Between us, let\\'s just forget the movie.A dire cuckoo-in-the-nest comedy.There\\'s the odd giggle, but nowhere near enough to keep things going.Enjoyable comedy with Owen Wilson on fine comic form, this is a lot better than its trailer suggests.A bit dull, since Dillon\\'s constrained playing the straight guy, Hudson has little to work with, and Douglas looks bored.... As stale and formulaic as it gets.It\\'s not seamless, but Wilson fans can safely roll out the welcome mat.Despite the clashing comedic styles, a game cast ... finds a few nuggets of truth and warmth, and several full-tilt belly laughs.What About Bob this ain\\'t.You, Me and Dupree overstays its welcome but a compilation reel of Wilson\\'s scenes would make for fairly funny viewing.I laughed, but it was at the expense of my pride.Wilson riffs hard and has his moments, but can\\'t save a comedy with not enough laughs.Low IQs plague otherwise funny Wilson vehicle ...The filmmakers can\\'t get the balance right between comedy and cruelty.This \\'comedy\\' is so clumsily executed and wheezy it\\'s a wonder anyone had the resolve to finish it.Remarkably forced--ironic, considering it\\'s a starring vehicle for an actor whose most defining quality is his laid-back, unaffected demeanor.Unfortunately, directors Anthony and Joe Russo sometimes push the jokes too hard, relying on tired physical comedy and easy visual jokes.Only good when Wilson\\'s around . . . in the end, the hints of misogyny and the suggestions of middle-class hollowness just blow away in a puff of cheery goodwill.A terribly mediocre film that squanders the talent of its stars on a story that could have been funny and even thoughtful.With its smart script and an ultra-likeable cast, You Me and Dupree is funny and wacky with plenty of heart, shifting focus beyond expectations ... The best part is the way the relationships between the three central characters change.Unfortunately for You, Me and Dupree, it\\'s easier to invest patience in people stumbling to find focus and purpose than films searching for the same things.Laugh-free, derivative, punishingly long \\'comedy.\\'Inflicting pain -- both on its characters and on hapless audience members -- seems to be the play of the day as far as this cesspool of a movie is concerned.I wouldn\\'t want to spend five minutes with these people in a cab. Not an hour together for dinner. And sure as hell not two hours together in a movie theater.In terms of actual laughs, this is somewhere between a scorching STD and a sleepy corporate-gig Dennis Miller show.Like the main character, the movie is okay at first but eventually wears out its welcome.You, Me and Dupree doesn\\'t risk failure, so it amounts to nothing.Russo and Russo can\\'t decide whether they\\'re making a sentimental farce about male friendship or a raunchy comedy spiced up with porn. The latter wins out, though the audience is the loser.It is only because of Wilson\\'s charm that this movie manages to entertain as much as it does, which is just barely enough.Forget those awful previews. \\'You, Me and Dupree\\' is a rather sweet little movie focusing on friendship, love, life goals, and being true to oneself.You\\'ve seen this kind of situation before, but Owen Wilson gets the warhorse new life.The movie can\\'t even decide who\\'s doing what to whom by the end. Molly throws Carl out at one point and then he comes back to apologize for walking out. That\\'s because they don\\'t know how to end a movie unless someone is apologizing for something.We\\'ve seen this all before, and quite frankly; it\\'s starting to get a bit boring.we get a whole season\\'s worth of sitcom in an less than two hours, whether or not this is a good thing is a quandary.Owen Wilson is perilously close to doing a Dupree on his own career, by wearing out his welcome.You, Me and Dupree seems to have been made by people who don\\'t know the difference between a light comedy and an inconsequential one.In the end, Dupree doesn\\'t add up to much except a forum for Wilson\\'s unique comic persona, which is more than enough for fans.Amiable if ragtag.This is the worst movie Wilson has made since he graduated from being Jackie Chan\\'s punch line.Ultimately, the movie is redeemed by a string of well-earned laughs and its trio of bright and engaging leads.You, Me and Dupree offers moderate fun in a less-than-stellar summer season.Gifted though [the directors] may be in smaller doses, they\\'re a long way from mastering the art of feature-length comedy.Wilson tries far too hard. Dillon is miserable as the square butt of dumb gags. And just six years after Almost Famous, isn\\'t Hudson still a tad young to play the solid, judgingly mature mommy-wife who talks of \\'prioritizing responsibilities?\\'Wilson deserves better, too. He\\'s too smart to make me believe he\\'d actually think this movie is funny.Yet another comedy about a man-child who won\\'t grow up, You, Me and Dupree has the faintly stale smell of food left overnight on the counter.Watching [Wilson] mug wildly in another uneven film short on plot, the audience may start to wish he would go away for awhile and stop turning up in such repetitive comedies.Owen Wilson single-handedly hauls this amiable, middle-of-the-road comedy out of sheer mediocrity.Think of the uncompromisingly mediocre comedy You, Me and Dupree as a referendum on whether audiences are tiring of Owen Wilson\\'s beatific stoner dude character as rapidly as I am.Wilson, Dillon and Hudson are likable stars, and there are moments when their characters make a convincing circle of friends. But the Russo brothers don\\'t have the maturity to blend the two prongs of the story they\\'ve written.If Wilson\\'s trademark grin is looking jaundiced by the finale, he has only himself to blame. With You, Me and Dupree, he has produced a movie as lazy and immature as its title character.If you like watching Owen Wilson play the same character he\\'s played for most of his Hollywood career, and like to be able to predict every comic bit in a movie, You, Me and Dupree is your cup of tea -- or, maybe, your six-pack.The laughs are low-key and although the characters are credible they seem to be missing a few dimensions, but the actors make this movie about an immature guy who moves into his newlywed pal\\'s house a pleasant enough visit.Dupree sustains its groove for the most part, and in this summer of bloated spectaculars, it feels tight. It may be silly, but it\\'s a pleasant enough diversion.Without core chemistry, the already flimsy plot is unbelievable. Without any sexual tension, the fate of the Hudson-Dillon marriage is irrelevant. Without any reason for Wilson to cut up and caper, why watch him do it?It\\'s fast-paced amusing fluff if you wanna, \"Stay loose, stay liquid and laugh a lot.You, Me and Dupree is lazy, obvious, never emotionally real and, most unfortunately, sporadically funny at best. It\\'s a movie you\\'ve seen before and you\\'ve seen done better. Owen, it\\'s time to grow up.If you\\'ve seen the trailer, you\\'ve seen only half the movie -- and all the jokes.In You, Me and Dupree, Owen Wilson plays a freeloading houseguest who wears out his welcome after one day. The film wears out its welcome considerably sooner than that.As Benjamin Franklin once observed, houseguests -- like fish -- begin to smell after three days. In [this] case, however, it takes less than two hours. Little more than a compendium of sight gags that amount to the odd burst of laughter, \"You, Me and Dupree\" would be unwatchable if not for its formidable cast.Every situation is completely contrived and almost wants to prove it to you.It stages its jokes externally, such as smashing bikes, spilling on skateboards, and catching on fire -- all the better if accompanied by a hot soundtrack hit.You, Me and Dupree mostly sputters.When he\\'s firing on all cylinders, Wilson plays the trickster catalyst, the knowing knave with charming lassitude. Now if only his accidental sage can find a fable worth his goofball wisdom.You, Me and Dupree features three first-rate actors in need of a first-rate movie.You, Me and Dupree, a houseguest-from-hell tale, is an amiable comedy, but patched together from the plots of so many other movies, recent and otherwise, as to create a distracting sense of deja vu throughout.You, Me and Dupree has the feel of a film that could have gone in any number of directions, and perhaps at one time went in all of them.Dupree\\'s presence is annoying and disruptive, but not remotely convincing as a legitimate catalyst for exposing anything insightful, amusing or charming about modern relationships.Wilson is the most intolerable of all. Watching him slack his way through this movie made me feel like Lou Dobbs. I didn\\'t like Dupree. I wanted him deported.Owen Wilson crashes a marriage.Dupree\\'s actions seem to be those of an extreme closet case, complete with an Audrey Hepburn fixation and a don\\'t-ask/don\\'t-tell obsession for his best friend.A video-store leftover, suitable only for viewers who have nothing better to do.Even with Wilson\\'s considerable charms trying to give [Dupree] depth, you wouldn\\'t ... want to spend two hours with him in a darkened movie theater.You probably wouldn\\'t want Dupree as a long-term houseguest but in small doses his \\'ness\\' is kinda fun.A braver, more female-empowering movie would have Molly come to her senses and realize that Dupree, hygiene and career problems aside, is twice the catch that Carl is.This movie is nothing more than a classily cast disaster, a Something About Mary meets Meet the Parents train wreck we\\'ve seen too many times before.When your straight man gets more laughs than you, it\\'s time to modify your act.brings together an exceptionally gifted cast and asks the actors to work wonders with mediocre material. Often they succeed, although not often enough to make the film a must-see...The story has a strong \\'been there, done that\\' feel to it.Feels like an afterthought, a trial-and-error effort in the search for the ideal Owen Wilson solo vehicle.The film\\'s three leads deliver competent yet thoroughly uninspired performances, with Wilson offering up the latest variation on his laid-back, cool-guy persona...Between you and me, Dupree is a dud.Funny that Owen Wilson should star in a film about a guy who wears out his welcome....Kate Hudson looks great in a swimsuit and heels...is that enough to recommend theater viewing? Not really.Can we all finally agree that Owen Wilson has jumped the shark?Even if it doesn\\'t make you laugh, the movie executives will, all the way to the bank.You, Me and Dupree is exactly the kind of brainless, witless junk that Hollywood knows it can peel off the scrap heap at any time and make a quick trip to the bank on.This is cringe-inducing humor at its most wooden.Third wheel\\'s a charm when the person happens to be Owen Wilson, indulging us yet again with his lovable-slacker persona.You, Me And Dupree drains Owen Wilson\\'s tank of charm down to the fumes.You, Me and Dupree may elicit some chuckles throughout, but the premise tires before the film runs its course.I don\\'t mean to imply that this film is any good or that it contains an ounce of genuine insight. But as a template for the big-baby genre, it\\'s invaluable.Sporadically enjoyable but instantly forgettable.The tone of You, Me and Dupree is smarmy in that institutional way that doesn\\'t seem to know what the tongue is doing in the cheek, exactly, but keeps it there just in case.The end product feels less funny than formulaic. Not to mention profoundly disheartening.Remember the classic comedy The Odd Couple? This is sort of the same movie, only it\\'s the odd triple and it isn\\'t funny.Artistically, You, Me and Dupree is a mess. Technically, it\\'s an abomination. Spiritually, it\\'s a void. Commercially, it\\'ll probably be a big hit.Although the movie offers a few chuckles here and there, it fails on almost every level.There are several problems with the romantic comedy You, Me and Dupree, not least that there is no filmmaking to speak of.I can\\'t imagine many beside Wilson pulling off a line about an Audrey Hepburn sex fantasy involving butter and having it come off as adoring and respectful. This is nothing more than dumb fun, with the scales strongly tipped towards dumb.Even die-hard Owen Wilson fans will find this feature-length sitcom slow going.A limp, uninspired dramedy that can never figure out what it wants to be about.You, Me and Dupree is pleasant, likable and warm, but it forgot to pack the funny.Dupree feels like the most opportunistic of Hollywood \\'packages\\' -- a trio of appealing stars with proven track records in this sort of fare paired with a script that\\'s been cobbled together out of odds and ends of other, better movies.A feel-good comedy about a slacker buddy who turns out to go way beyond his obligations as a best man. Something, anything needs to be done soon to keep Wilson\\'s stoner-savant persona from becoming as generic a product as dairy-case cookie dough.Oh, sweet, sly celebration of slackerdom... I\\'m so glad we met.I don\\'t know how long Owen Wilson can continue to coast on his dippy charm, but as long as his coasting elevates high-concept comedies such as You, Me and Dupree, it\\'s fine by me.Owen Wilson is either an acquired taste or a comedic force who gathers more momentum and skill as he goes. In any case, he gets funnier and funnier with each film.Were it not for the A-list cast, You, Me and Dupree is an effort one might expect to move directly to video store shelves, bypassing multiplexes altogether.In summer multiplex fare, Owen Wilson does better than Cable Guy, but not much.Given the intellectual level of this film and its lack of humor, it is not surprising that the ending rewards bad behavior. If you\\'re smart, it\\'s an ending you will never see.Owen Wilson manages to make it sporadically pleasant, but not nearly enough to make up for the mediocrity of this overblown sitcom.You, Me and Dupree is a situation comedy that subsists purely on vibe, namely Owen Wilson\\'s ever-boyish vibe of an innocence that has overstayed its welcome long into adulthood.The problem is not the stars. The problem is that the basic conceit of the movie was bent out of shape by the bigger issue of \"Who is the star?The joke, of course, is that it\\'s really Owen Wilson who\\'s in control. He can\\'t play the dazed rogue forever, but for now he\\'s the happy master of that domain.It\\'s really Dupree, Dupree and Way Too Much Dupree. Owen Wilson doesn\\'t just star in the movie, he sucks the oxygen out of the room.What makes Owen Wilson a special exception is that his characters always work to make the world more child-like and whimsical, and the films brighten up as a result.After several false endings, this overlong comedy finally comes to a close. But for everyone involved, the honeymoon was over before it even began.One trio you should avoid making a quartet by taking a seat in the audience.Not even Owen Wilson\\'s potent slacker charm can save it from a fatal lack of any sort of momentum, much less energy, leaving it with the sort of stasis that sucks all the fun right out of the proceedingsVacillates wildly between the scattered pearls of comic classics and bone-tired comic convention.The movie goes from being another mildly depressing lump of unrealized comic potential to being an actively unpleasant experience.Hudson and Dillon are straight arrows for Wilson\\'s bespoke character. Fails to ignite comedy.As the unwanted bum guest, Owen Wilson plays a variation of the role played by Monty Woolley in Man Who Came to Dinner and Nolte in Down and Out in Beverly Hills, but unlike them, he\\'s just a disturbing presence and has no profound effect on his guests.The most clever aspect of You, Me and Dupree is its rhyming title...after that, it\\'s one long, steep decline into suffering.A middling third-wheel comedy elevated a couple of notches by the ineffably weird charms of Owen Wilson.The comedy is obvious and flat while the drama is stale.nannannannanEvery big comic setpiece plays like an idea for a comic setpiece rather than the finished article.Although the ingredients are all there, set to rise, something is missing, some crucial element to lift it up.Sequel to the mediocre Ben Stiller comedy \"Meet The Parents\" is a bawdier but inferior movie that relies on the star power of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as Stiller\\'s Florida-dwelling Jewish hippie parents Bernie and Roz to fuel its ill-timed toiA consistently entertaining, sometimes uproariously funny film.Repeats itself and strains for laughs where the original giddily stumbled through them.Milk bottles and related metaphors feature prominentlyas breast fetish stand-ins, but with a decidely peculiar asymmetrical preference for just the left one.Has its smattering of laughs, but the new faces bring fewer dividends than the elemental De Niro/Ben Stiller showdown of the original.full review in GreekMeet the Fockers is frequently funny, but it turns a bit too cruel in the third act to be as worthy a sequel to its predecessor as it could have beenThis sequel\\'s title indicates the content: smutty, silly and liable to make you smirk despite yourself.Fans of the first will find some amusement in familiarity, but with such a comically able cast this is a missed opportunity.The expected misunderstandings ensue, as you\\'d expect, which would be pretty excruciating if not for the performances of Hoffman and Streisand.[Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand] seem to have been waiting their whole careers to do unrestrained comedy, and they step into their roles with unparalleled enthusiasm.Amazing how altering one vowel from the king of all cuss words can spawn a movie franchise....just as mediocre and gratingly unfunny as its predecessor...Catch it on HBO for the sheer delight of everything Hoffman and Streisand do. It\\'s fun to meet the Fockers themselves, but the rest of the movie can stay home.Mildly amusing...but joke repetition and a greater emphasis on outrageousness and vulgarity release a strong scent of the writers\\' desperation.This sequel, like most, is inferior to the original, but it is hard not to like these characters.Hoffman, in particular, is a delight - he has an infectious comic energy that seems to light up the rest of the cast.Very often vulgar and tasteless, and though there are some unexpected bursts of humor and even charm in the proceedings, it\\'s light years away from Chekhov.Although not as disarmingly funny the second time around, inspired casting means that, unlike most in-laws, the Fockers don\\'t outstay their welcome.so exaggerated that it veers wildly and awkwardly into pure, outlandish farceEven Stiller, who I\\'ve always appreciated, seems to be going through the motions here.Gauge your interest by how you liked Parents and you won\\'t be disappointed.The abundance of talent gathered for Meet the Fockers is sadly shortchanged by the unimaginative script and directorial laissez faire.[Hoffman and Streisand] make a wonderful team, but it\\'s too bad the material isn\\'t fresher and more worth their time and yours.It does what few comedies achieve, literally giving me a laugh a minute, sometimes good, deep belly laughs. A vulgar farce that isn\\'t remotely amusing.Clearly contrived, yet at times undeniably funny. Still, from this cast, you may be expecting more substance and less sophomore. No se trata de una obra de arte ni una competidora a los Oscar, pero...A quin le importa eso cuando lo que uno busca es rerse un poco?...[a] star-studded but tediously uneven low-brow sequel...Meet the Fockers is pretty much a flavorless family affair to forgetThe awkward, uncomfortable charms of the previous picture have here been replaced with an aggressive vulgarity that bears not even a passing resemblance to human behavior.Fockers has the combined subtlety of a libido-mad bull elephant and a bad case of flatulence in church, but that\\'s the kind of movie it is. You should get your kicks from the Fockers.Hoffman...is like the one kid in gym class who takes Frisbee golf seriously.There is not one joke in Meet the Fockers.Familiary breeds contempt...Unless you think a dog flushed down a toilet is a laugh riot, you\\'re better off leaving these Fockers alone.If you have absolutely nothing else to do, and you can see it for free, with little hassle, you just might get Fockersized..Does little to alter the formula of the original, but the two films set a nice example of successful use of the concept of theme and variation....the story fails to take the high road...The foreplay was a little boring, but once they start Fockering, it works... It may be absurd and in poor taste, but that doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t still be funny.This is silliness that\\'s good for a video replay on a rainy day.Could they not have come up with anything but lumpish, vulgar humor and dumb \"Focker\" puns?A comic clash of stereotypical Red State and Blue State culture, but with a wish-fulfillment Hollywood ending in which \\'Fockerization\\' triumphs...Could have been much funnier than it is.Like virtually every sequel to a hit comedy, it recycles and essentially beats to death everything that got a laugh in the original film.A little coarser, a little more desperate and a lot less funny than its predecessor. But Dustin Hoffman saves the day.It\\'s left to Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman as Greg\\'s parents to warm up the picture, and they light it on fire.The Fockers is a must-have for family viewing. It maintains its humor remarkably well, the gifted cast of superstars playing off one another with surprising ease. And, while the belly laughs of the first are noticeably absent, this one doesn\\'t wear out its welcome quite as quickly as that one did.A one joke movie but Streisand and Hoffman make that one joke enjoyable.Both movies lack the real discomfort and awkwardness that comes with meeting future in-laws.This film has a lot more heart and it\\'s just a lot of fun throughout with all these wonderful actors.There can be worse holiday fluff than watching a tight-knit group of Hollywood veterans having fun.You\\'d think after an eight-year absence from the screen, [Streisand would] return with more self-respect.Watching Meet the Fockers is like attending a big, potentially wild and funny party in which the guests pretend to have fun.Fifteen years ago, a movie with Streisand, Hoffman and DeNiro in starring roles would have been considered the casting coup of the ages.If it weren\\'t for the talent level involved onscreen, Meet the Fockers would be about as entertaining as a rerun of Dharma and Greg.Why would you want to meet such a blowsy, bawdy, shticky crew in a low-comedy sequel to Meet the Parents? Two reasons only: Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman.It is Beavis and Butt-head rewriting The In-Laws, only the scripts for Beavis were much smarter.A resolutely average sequel, several subbasements below the first film in both comic inspiration and energy.Often-uproarious.The exceptional cast turned the garden-variety script they were given into a movie that should please crowds throughout the holiday season.Don\\'t even rent the DVD, it\\'ll only encourage them.Despite a cast enhanced with notable players -- Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand come on board as the elder Fockers -- the movie has few new jokes to tell, offering little more than slight modulations of familiar scenarios.When a movie\\'s title is based on a crass pun, you shouldn\\'t expect the bar to be too highThe laughs are few and far between, bearing only a sloppy, derivative resemblance to its predecessor.A negligible product content to stoop for the easy laughs and the easy money.A silly good time.Delivers fewer laughs than its predecessor.The family is bigger, but the laughs aren\\'t.Meet the Fockers takes time to generate comic momentum, but the irresistible energy of Hoffman and Streisand soon refreshes the leftover story line from Parents.In the tradition of recent Hollywood sequels, this one replays the old gags, gooses up the pace and lowers the level of the humor -- way lower.More than any recent comedy I can think of, Meet the Fockers seems likely to split audiences between those who find it deliriously funny and those who grind their teeth at its obviousness.For audiences that loved Meet the Parents, the movie is a welcome chance to revisit funny and familiar characters.Meet the Fockers is not much of a movie -- just a lot of comic situations barely held together by the semblance of a plot -- but it is genuinely funny in a crass way.By the film\\'s finale you\\'ll pity any poor fool who actually is named Focker -- for following this picture they\\'re certain to see a surge in mockery.If you enjoyed Meet the Parents, you\\'ll have just as much fun in Meet the Fockers.It\\'s a toss-up as to who gets the worst end of the deal with Meet the Fockers: the audience or the film\\'s all-star cast.Irrepressible Streisand brings her own potent barrage to this company of self-interested men, not to mention the melt-away women.A quick-and-dirty cash-grab sequel, one that substitutes stunt casting for character work and schtick for writing.Meet the Fockers is as tacky as its title, as crass as a kid learning his first cuss word.A sloppy and not-funny- enough sequel to Meet the Parents.Meet the Fockers, a sluggish sequel to the anarchic domestic comedy Meet the Parents, is one visit too many.If you keep your expectations in check, the encounter doesn\\'t disappoint.Hoffman and Streisand give energetic, game performances, but the movie provides them with dispiritingly little material.One of those relatively rare comedies that\\'s at once puerile, charming and very funny throughout.Amusing ... but not distinctive.Thanks to an ensemble cast that includes Robert De Niro, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman, Meet The Fockers is much more fun than anticipated.There is some fun in watching the veterans mix it up -- De Niro, who looks like he wants to fade into the scenery, Streisand, who tries to eat it -- but nothing is well developed here.This sequel keeps the laughs coming until the ending.Meet the Fockers is not a movie for the ages; it\\'s a movie for a few good laughs.Playing up the socio-religious rifts of the first film, the sequel reflects the country\\'s current political schisms.Hoffman and Streisand are the best things about Meet the Fockers. The movie would have been better off spending more time with them instead of focusing again on the uneasy relationship between eager-to-please Greg and his father-in-law- to-be Jack.Given how well Stiller and De Niro play off each other, you\\'ll wish they had more to work with.Meet the Fockers doesn\\'t have the shabby feel of some faltering movies, but its repetitive gags and toilet humor take much of the luster off the Focker-Byrnes wedding.The movie is pleasant enough, but never quite reaches critical mass as a comedy.A rascally little play on words is the funniest element of Meet the Fockers, a sequel with big name stars and, only occasionally, laughs to match.Culture-clashing through the snow, in a one-joke open sleigh, Meet the Fockers goes, laughing all the way . . . to the bank.Meet the Fockers is stuck somewhere between being absolutely hilarious and one of the worst comedies ever committed to celluloid. Hoffman and Streisand provide some laughs in this sequel to Meet the Parents but the screenplay lacks comic zest.The picture has two lingering scenes that are so excruciatingly funny they compensate for the material that flounders.And you thought your parents were embarrassing.My New Year\\'s plea to Stiller? Watch Sideways. Rinse. Repeat.The audience laughed more because they wanted to find it funny than because they actually did.Meet the Fockers isn\\'t quite as funny as its predecessor, but it definitely has its moments. The ideas behind Meet The Fockers are the best part of this zany sequel to Meet The Parents, but getting Fockerised is not as funny as it should be.Coasts on considerable star power to make us laugh with some consistency but never approaches the level of fearless comic abandon that made the first film so popular.Meet The Fockers is a fine sequel; not surpassing the original, but clearly putting forth more of an effort than most follow-ups do into the script department. This isn\\'t just a second helping of Gaylord Focker humiliation, for once here\\'s a comedy sequel that manages to revisit its world without banally repeating it.Hoffman and Streisand...are a wonderful addition to the comedic mix with their relaxed, laid back lifestyle and penchant for randy sexBarbra Streisand has the show-stopping moments in this uneven comedy.Because no good joke in Hollywood goes untold again ... and again, the mixed-couple setup receives another extended workout in this modestly amusing sequel.The gap between the first and second installments isn\\'t as gaping as with, for instance, Analyze This and Analyze That, but the laughs Fockers generates are the type you feel embarrassed about almost immediately afterward.Formulaic but consistently funny.So many subplots are piled onto Meet the Fockers that it\\'s a wonder any of the glittering talents assembled here have room to be funny.A weary retread without a fraction of the inventiveness that sparked the original.Never has so much talent been wasted with so little imagination.Director Jay Roach gives the film no visual distinction whatsoever but packs on the jokes with tireless bustle.The ensemble\\'s giddy chemistry and the addition of perfectly cast topliners Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand should find Fockers entertaining huge crowds for the holidays and beyond.Though it\\'s good to see [Stiller] back in his stumbling, bumbling element, it\\'s a bummer to see his element wasted in such stumbling, bumbling gags.Simply too much unpleasantness afoot.Streisand and especially Hoffman are a hoot.From the start the jokes are on a different level than the last one: coarse, aggressive, and poorly timed by director Jay Roach.Streisand and Hoffman are a hoot, the most entertaining Haight-Ashbury movie refugees since Lily Tomlin and Alan Alda similarly tormented Stiller in Flirting With Disaster.De Niro\\'s brilliantly economical expression of utter revulsion somehow never stops being funny.DeNiro is pretty much the only reason to see Meet the Fockers...[betrays] creative exhaustion.Stiller - by starring in Meet the Fockers, one of the year\\'s final releases - pulls into a buzzer-beating tie with Jude Law as the most-overexposed actor of the movie year.There\\'s room left open, of course, for the eagerly-awaited conclusion to the Parent Focker trilogy. Here\\'s hoping that when that blessed day arrives, I\\'ll be good and dead.Greg Focker is ashamed of his loving parents and Jack Byrnes needs Viagra. repetitious and just not that funny on the whole, especially since it\\'s so derivative and out of character next to the originalForced and formulaic sequel ... is a tedious disappointment.This pic is pretty Focking lame.If you don\\'t think Ben Stiller is funny, Spanglish is playing at the next theater over. Meet The Fockers made me laugh so hard my stomach started to ache.A frantic, pointless sequel, funny in clumps, but mostly contrived and empty.While there is a serious subtext, cast and crew remember that this is essentially a frivolous comedynannannannannannanIt\\'s always a bad sign in a thriller when the big reveal is greeted by hoots of derisive laughter.As with many modern thrillers the actual plot, once it comes to light, is highly implausible, there are a few too many turns towards the end and the climax errs towards the anti-climatic. That being said, it\\'s well put together and entertainingly moody.a white-knuckle ride into the anxieties and terrors of the new millennium... Fasten your seatbelts.Following a smooth takeoff, this psychological thriller hits some turbulence and crash lands due to a preposterous, almost comical, turn of events.Foster is a master at portraying a woman in terror who\\'s trying to balance her fears with a survival instinct that drives her to somehow prevail.full review in GreekWhile I do think that Foster and the movies she makes need to lighten up, that isn\\'t quite what I have in mind.The bickering back and forth between Foster and Sarsgaard becomes tiresome. And the erriness dissipates without anything as interesting to replace it.A disposable B-movie without much excitement or ingenuity.It\\'s not a good movie despite its stylishness and performances, but it does have a short window of appeal for reasons entirely independent of its plausibility.The movie may not soar, but it flies.As plane-based suspense thrillers go, Flightplan has a smooth take off and cruises along nicely for a while, but it hits a rocky patch of turbulence in the third act and goes into a fatal tailspin. Rumor is Ms. Foster\\'s picky about scripts. It\\'s an interesting notion, but it doesn\\'t quite explain the existence of FlightplanThe makers of Flightplan have trimmed all the meat off The Lady Vanishes as if it were fat and served us the bone.If you can forgive the story for being what it is, as I could not, you will probably get your money\\'s worth out of this film. When will they ever learn?It never really takes off as a fully developed chiller, rather settling for familiar characters and cloudy motivations.With two and a half good acts out of three and a charismatic Jodie Foster holding at the centre, Flightplan warrants the fare for paying passengers.[Flight Plan] may not win Foster another Oscar, [but] it manages to remind us of how entirely commanding a screen presence she can be.A big disappointment.Takes off well, but boy is the landing bumpy.Director Schwentke swoops around his giant set with an energetic style that keeps this widescreen film from becoming too claustrophobic.Foster doesn\\'t make a lot of movies these days...but I\\'m starting to wish she\\'d be a little more selective about what she deigns to appear in....it\\'s far from First Class.... a script with a social agenda nearly undermines all the film had going for it...We live in an era of soccer moms and mommy journalism, and Foster is all aboard with mommy-based moviemaking.presented with such enthusiastic abandon that it\\'s easy to get caught up in the proceedings, no matter how far-fetched.Foster is the reason to see \"Flightplan\"; she lends the film both a consummate strength and vulnerability.When the movie was over, I stepped out into the daylight and felt a weird sensation. It was a form of relief. The suspense had gotten to me more deeply than I expected.Flightplan isn\\'t the most intense thriller to roar down the runway, but provides its own sort of satisfaction. While the hidden agenda that eventually surfaces does strain credibility, Foster\\'s ability to reign in the improbable ... allows this flight to deliver the requisite thrills.Flightplan\" crash lands after take off.The movie plummets into a swamp of ever-increasing -- and increasingly amusing -- preposterosity. Remain seated? No problem.Anticipating the explanation of what\\'s going on proves more interesting than the explanation.While the story may not be very plausible, the film is compelling largely because of excellent performances by Jodie Foster and Peter Sarsgaard.[Foster\\'s] such a valuable commodity that I wish she\\'d spend her time making better movies.Queasy, anxiety-driven and forgettable...I\\'d advise grounding it.It\\'s in the final act when Flightplan goes from passable to pitiful.Foster does the frantic head of the family under great threat very well, as she so superbly demonstrated in an earlier state of panic.The key to the film is Foster, who reminds us why she\\'s so missed these days.We\\'re starkly reminded that there\\'s nothing quite so fickle as paranoia, and that some people are never more persuasive than when they\\'re out of their minds.Strange. \"Tim Burton\\'s Corpse Bride\" takes off. \"Flightplan\" stinks. You\\'d think it would be the other way around.On the heels of the recent release of Wes Craven\\'s crafty and creepy airline thriller Red Eye, Flightplan seems to hit a lot of unnecessary air pockets in comparisonFoster\\'s acting packs a punch but her \\'Flight\\' is grounded by one too many coincidences.Can she escape his clutches, find her child and solve the mystery? And do we care?Foster\\'s go-for-broke plunge into the material makes the flimsy twists barely tolerable.I do think this is a solid thriller for our times.Jodie, Jodie, Jodie ---- what could you have been thinking?......a rather nifty psychological drama for the first hour, after which it descends into an ordinary mom-battling-the-evil-people-alone plot.Flightplan might not necessary execute the cleverest of landings, but with Jodie Foster onboard, you know it\\'ll at least have an excellent takeoff. A co-pilot remarks that all children should have to wear a cowbell. That\\'s true at least for the people aboard this plane....an exercise in pure entertainment.It\\'s a profoundly stupid plot.... The amazing feat is that, while the film has you in its grasp, you barely notice. Genius.Flightplan should have remained grounded for repairs.The longer the conclusion drags, the more attractive the exit sign looks.This is the kind of empty film that usually plays on airline flights.What I expect from a thriller is that it keep me guessing while scaring the socks off me -- and \\'Flightplan\\' passes this test with flying colors.Unfortunately, the best part of \\'Flightplan\\' is the airplane, which exists only on film.Jodie Foster doesn\\'t impress in this lackluster thriller that is far-fetched and uninvolving.The vanished child one really misses here is that adorably sparky, wised-up kid from Bugsy Malone and Alice Doesn\\'t Live Here Any More.It might not seem quite so awful, even reprehensible, if it didn\\'t waste a pretty good cast, or if it didn\\'t trot out that ultimate poor-taste cliche, a child in peril.One of those thrillers that pivots around the question of how daring -- or how focus-group cautious -- we suspect the filmmakers will turn out to be.The last fifteen minutes are extremely stupid and almost ruin all that good stuff we\\'ve had before.When all is said and done, it builds to a climax so tedious the only mystery is how big a yawn will be generated by the endgame theatrics.By the time we reach the interminable third act and its action movie climax, it\\'s clear Flightplan never should have gotten off the ground.Succeeds admirably, both as a sophisticated psychological thriller and as an example of, if not great art, then superb craftsmanship.A more than decent thriller.Jodie Foster\\'s fiercely intelligent performance drives this disappointing thriller, whose taut, carefully constructed first half is sadly negated by its implausible and -- worst of all -- unengaging conclusion.Not worth the trip.Just another thriller with too much plot.Foster\\'s cobalt-blue eyes and pale, pointy features have rarely been used to such ambiguous effect. Is she the hardest or the most hurt-looking woman you\\'ve ever seen?It\\'s a tense, concise and elegantly shot film that creates a sense of menace from the very beginning - - and in a way that\\'s unusual.The makers of an anti-anxiety drug mentioned in Flightplan will probably rethink their involvement once they see the film.Although it\\'s certainly watchable and has some striking moments, Flightplan is ultimately a middling effort that lacks dramatic pay-off.The last thing we need right now is another blubbering emoter.Flightplan, nerve-racking as it is, stops well short of its final destination.Attention please, this in-flight movie will be cancelled due to a predictable plot that leaves one about as satisfied a bag of airplane peanuts.The contrast between Kyle\\'s multiple layers of loss and the flurry of life that goes on without her is briefly compelling.Flightplan grows more and more ponderous and frustrating as the reasons behind Kyle\\'s predicament are revealed to be increasingly outlandish.The plot, once you have time to think about it, should so obviously never have been cleared for takeoff.Here\\'s the plan the writers came up with to handle the obstacles between their story and plausibility: Ignore them.There\\'s so little reason behind the plot that it\\'s hard to focus on Foster\\'s fierce performance.If you bring an eye mask and a few sleeping pills, you should get through it OK.The care and craft exhibited by director Robert SchwentkeRobert Schwentke in Flightplan is largely undone by a script that self-destructs in the third act of an otherwise well-made thriller.It\\'s a grabby premise in search of a movie.It\\'s high anxiety. Too bad the landing is so bumpy.Flightplan calls to mind that old Kris Kristofferson song, The Pilgrim, about the man who doesn\\'t know if the goin\\' up was worth the comin\\' down.So, just book a reservation to see this movie already.Flightplan has holes and blank spots you could steer an airbus through.Flightplan maintains emotional altitude until it starts hitting the turbulence of unbelievable coincidence.The longer this one remains in the air, the less inspired it becomes.Flightplan - - a heart-stopping thriller.Talk about fear of flying ...As lean and taut as the muscles on Jodie Foster\\'s fine- boned face, Flightplan is a terrific-looking thriller that wastes no time with embellishment or asides.Ultimately what makes this picture fly is Foster, who\\'s playing another character who turns jeopardy into vengeance as a rite of motherhood.Foster is believable, but casting her is like entering a Maserati in the soapbox derby.Two thirds of this movie is pretty gosh-darn good and suspenseful. The third act, on the other hand...meh, not so much.Directed with a crisp eye and some fluid flourishes, and Foster makes the thing perfectly watchable, but one can\\'t help but think Flightplan is all premise and no plot.I was so annoyed with Foster\\'s character that I hoped the air marshal would put a bullet in her brain and thus end the misery for the audience.[Y]ou can almost feel [Foster] spinning her artistic wheels as the story spins into the ridiculous...The filmmakers take us on a gripping ride -- they just forgot to pack a parachute.Flightplan is another one of those thrillers with a clever setup that, once all the cards are laid out and the plan is revealed in full, completely collapses.Good performances and striking looks are meaningless if your story falls apart when the tensions should be ratcheting up to unbearable levelFoster\\'s character in Flightplan is incredibly one-note, and it really wears on you after a bit.cleverly combines old-school suspense and modern-day paranoia into a tense, compact thriller that\\'s scarier than a long flight on a bankrupt airline.This airborne Jodie Foster thriller pretty much runs on autopilot and lands somewhere between not bad and not great.What starts out as a decent thriller soon winds up plummeting to the ground, brought down by its own improbable plot twists and illogical storyline.Flightplan is two-thirds of a great movie and one-third of a mediocre one, but hey, even the mediocre one has Jodie Foster in it.Flightplan is a good example of Foster\\'s uncanny ability to make almost any material work.Like a delicious oven confection that has us clamoring for its final outcome, once the door is open too soon - it flattens on sight.fantastic job setting up a very eerie, frightening and confusing story ... but the ending falls short of our greatest hopesSo preposterous that you not only have to put your brain on hold but remove it from your skull, toss it to the floor and stomp it into insensibility.It\\'s always a bad sign in a thriller when the big reveal is greeted by hoots of derisive laughter.Panic Room made sense, and Flightplan does not. None at all, really.Packed with enough crates of red herring to feed a starving city...one of the lamest psychological thrillers to come along in a whileIt\\'s got plenty of talented people working on it, but it seems like they all turned a blind eye to the fact that they were creating something truly terrible.plunges almost immediately into the suspense and maintains it throughout, highlighted by terrific performances by Foster, Sarsgaard, and Bean.[Foster is] terrific in the part, and the movie is great fun.Despite the participation of selective, talented actress Jodie Foster and a screenplay that borrows heavily from The Lady Vanishes, Flightplan can\\'t avoid falling apart during its final half-hour.[Flightplan stays on] a course mapped out by so many celluloid disappearing acts that pale in the long shadow of Hitchcock\\'s The Lady Vanishes.Flightplan establishes a solid enough takeoff, but with such unnecessary distractions, even Foster can\\'t save it from crashing.Outrageous illogical resolution to what is otherwise a fine thriller.The movie loses some of its initial atmospheric tension as paranoid thrills give way to Rambo high jinks.Jodie Foster might draw audiences on opening weekend, and who knows what the spectacular drama this week at LAX may do for an in-flight melodrama. But audiences might react adversely to such transparent manipulation for so weak a payoff.Flightplan is sillier and more outlandish than Red Eye, and ultimately less effective, but it\\'s still fun and certainly not boring.To watch Jodie Foster storm through a phony airplane for an entire movie has its very minor pleasures, but there is nothing here to feed the head or fray the nerves.If the film had met the expectations so well laid down by the advertising campaign, we would have a top-notch thriller on our hands.Every time the film starts to ascend into dramatic territory, it hits an air pocket and loses momentumThe script by Billy Ray and Peter A. Dowling contains plot holes the size of an Airbus.Where the flight from hell leads is no great shake, but getting there is exciting enough to be worth the trip.Flightplan is like airplane food. No matter how good the ingredients the air chef has to work with, the entree inevitably ends up tasting like a Xerox of a facsimile of a meal.The first half, which is vintage Hitchcock, is by far superior to the second half, which is pure Steven Seagal.Foster should get frequent crier miles for this role; she shifts her character into panic mode so quickly that we also have no trouble believing she could be losing her marbles.Flightplan is not a smart movie, but it can be a reasonably fun and entertaining one.The movie\\'s concept is cool, the execution is taut and filled with suspense, but the resolution is badly flawed.Flightplan delivers a frightening thriller with an airtight plot.Everything from the icy blue palette of the cinematography to the icy blue glare of its star speaks to a mood that is somber rather than hyperkinetic.Not since William Shatner saw a thingie on the wing of his plane in an old Twilight Zone has a flight been thrown into such panic by one passenger.Foster plays the mother of all mothers. The movie imparts a fear of flying, all right - - but only because it reminds you of the dross you\\'re usually forced to watch up there.Flightplan is a crackler of a suspense film and a solid entry into the early autumn season.A first-rate thriller before it crashes and burns in the final act...The solution to the mystery is a real groaner and a politically correct cop out.Flightplan never attains liftoff since its basic premise is never made credible, even for a minute.The third act begins with another twist - but this one is so arduous, absurd and out of character for the film that the entire plot, stretching back to Scene One, is sabotagedMarred by implausibility, underdeveloped characters, and bad climax, technically Flightplan is great, taking full advantage of its confined space and restricted narrative timenannannannannannannannannannannannanI\\'d like to report that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button represents the end of an era, one of those turning-points when American movies just have to change because they can\\'t get any worse. Throughout, the film seems to lack the necessary ingredient to engage the audience with more than its superficial beauty.It could have worked, had it ever snapped to life, but it doesn\\'t. It just goes on and on and on and on and on and on. And on. You may even shake your watch to check it is still going. I know I did.... I was pleasantly surprised.One troubling thing is the pedophile overtone that runs throughout the film.Converts an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story about a man aging backward into an overly long exercise in pseudo-profundity bearing little resemblance to its source.A man who ages backwards will never be able to bond to another person in a truly meaningful way. We can barely be expected to return affection that isn\\'t there.Everything sure is pretty, but I\\'m not sure this movie has anything to say.One of the best half-movies of the year.David Fincher\\'s epic doesn\\'t wallow in nihilistic obsessions, but preached no comforting homily about life\\'s rich pageant either. Life is feel-good in spurts - a series of oddly interconnected, occasionally elating moments that accumulate before death.It\\'s not an inherently flawed premise, but it is in writer Roth\\'s saccharine-stained hands. It\\'s frustrating, because it\\'s easy to see how it could have been so much better.Sure, I cried at the end. I\\'m not a robot. But I cry at cat food commercials if they punch the right button.

Nothing more. Nothing less. And told most poetically.Fincher\\'s fascination with, and film\\'s illusory power over, time deepened the mystery of his previous film, Zodiac. Such insights also redeem Button from its cuteness and kitsch.It\\'s a curious story indeed, a long and rambling exploration of time and what we make of it.It is the cream of the crop in the categories of cinematography, editing, art direction, sound mixing, costume design, special visual effects, makeup and original musical score.An exceptionally well made movie with strong performances, most notably those by Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton, both at the top of their games.On the one hand, it is a masterful piece of craftsmanship, replete with outstanding cinematography, set design and special effects makeup work. On the other hand, it\\'s slow-paced and overstuffed, not to mentionThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an anodyne Hollywood film that offers a safe and sanitised view of life and death. It\\'s Forrest Gump goes backwards.This bizarre American odyssey carries a lot of cultural freight, but fails to delivers it to a destination of any significance.Fincher treats Roth\\'s script with a visual bravura and narrative gusto far beyond the usual capacities of the Hollywood mainstream. Benjamin Button is a poetic, virtuoso feat, as eloquent and rapturous as CGI-era cinema gets.The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is not just a technical marvel, it is an epic piece of storytelling with an incredible attention to detail.This sensational film is richly deserving of the lavish praise it has won from all corners.The film is sporadically entertaining and intends to be profound but has nothing to say about life except we shouldn\\'t waste a single precious moment of it. But I learned that already from Jim Carrey in Yes Man, and in nearly half the time.Remove \"curious\" from the title and replace it with \"twee and pointless\", and you\\'re close to it.

It\\'s a testament to Fincher\\'s skill as a storyteller that the film actually works, albeit sporadically.An unusual conceit brilliantly executed. A moving work of golden fantasy poised just above the dark waters of our own mortality.It is a tedious marathon of smoke and mirrors. In terms of the basic requirements of three-reel drama the film lacks substance, credibility, a decent script and characters you might actually care for.If the film falls short of greatness, it\\'s because Button remains too enigmatic.A rich, rewarding, polished diamond of a film.Life, death and a love that burns bright and brief as a firefly... Only Fincher could lighten up and still turn in a film obsessed with transience, with mortality. Flecked with flaws, Button nonetheless stands as a monument to its maker\\'s talent.This is a compelling and wondrous film. Yes it is a little slow at times, but this is an epic tale of a miraculous romance - and you can\\'t rush such things.It often catches the Fitzgerald mood of elegy and might-have-been: that subtle rapture of remembrance that can make us prize the lost past or future over the gift-wrapped immediacies of the present.An intended tour de force, it is strangely unable to engage the emotions. In the end it amounts to an overweight movie that delivers less than its clever director, David Fincher, seems to think.Enjoyable, engaging and beautifully made drama with stunning special effects and terrific performances from Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.TCCOBB is monumentally impressive.

Call it cinematic mediation.All the intense, pent up passion between Benjamin and Daisy which kept the film so taut and engrossing for an hour and a half is a mortifying drain once they unite and are free to express their devotion.Brad Pitt is growing as an actor but his lack of chemistry with Blanchett robs the movie of its emotional corePitt\\'s Benjamin is colorless, gawping, and passive.There\\'s leisure to the storytelling, a splendor that captures the movie\\'s celebratory but also melancholy ideas about our time on this mortal coil.Button has a wide-eyed innocence that almost never palls.

Now what?It\\'s like a box of chocolates, but with hollow centers.Fincher renders the era with a precise eye for atmosphere and physical detail.This is a long, impeccably detailed, richly textured movie about a most unusual life, and although it\\'s far from perfect, the sum of it achieves what Fincher set out to do in the first place.Benjamin Button falls short of greatness. But no other film this year has been so open to the possibilities of cinematic storytelling.Contemplative, sumptuous and haunting, this is one of the year\\'s best films.Director David Fincher has turned out an overlong, Forrest Gumpian exercise in mannered whimsy. It\\'s sentimental; it\\'s episodic; it dawdles. Brad Pitt spends a good length of screen time drinking tea with Tilda Swinton. But it\\'s also bewitching.Damn thing never seems to end.A film whose individual parts are more entrancing than the middlebrow whole.An extravagantly ambitious movie that\\'s easy to admire but a challenge to love.It\\'ll take two and a half hours of your life and still make you feel younger.Benjamin Button may be the most passive titular character in a motion picture until The Terri Schiavo Story gets off the ground.A symphony in the language of film.

I\\'m not sure, but it is definitely good enough to be.Even if The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn\\'t the home run Fincher\\'s devoted fan base was hoping for, it is a beautifully crafted movie.It takes a world-class storyteller and a great yarn to rivet your attention for nearly three hours. This very classy, old-school movie -- employing cutting-edge technology that will make your eyes pop -- did it for me.That this movie doesn\\'t seem fantastic at all is a testimony to its emotional power.It\\'s Fincher\\'s picture, and his universe is one of exquisite fakery and frequent, elegant visual delight.It\\'s a testament to Fincher\\'s craftsmanship that even such a bleak message can evoke feelings of hope and wonder.Despite its length and expansive pace, it\\'s never dull. And, despite the dubiousness of its stabs at being \"meaningful,\" it still leaves you with more than most mega-productions....a romantic, gentle, and magical movie.People will tell you this is a deeply romantic film. Don\\'t buy it - because you\\'ll be missing out on the true value of the movie.An artistic and narrative triumph and one of the most beautiful love stories set to screen in a very long time.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn\\'t about a man who lives backwards or a woman who lives forwards ... Get past the plot, the pitch, and the technique, and you can see it as a reminder that all we can do is live now.It tells a grand, eloquent tale full of romance and melancholy.The adapted screenplay by Eric Roth...[uses] his own \"Forrest Gump\" as the outline, gives us a central character who is far too passive and fails to apply the wisdom of age to youth in any profound way.There may not be the normal, anticipated dosage of sentiment to latch onto in this film, but in exchange for patience and a little faith, Button presents the exquisite weight of the human experience in a manner the screen rarely witnesses.Fitzgerald Gumpified...a gorgeously-made would-be tearjerker that leaves the ducts dry because of its extreme artificiality, in both plot and execution.Pitt is quite good in the lead even if it does take close to two hours for him to show up in a matinee idol form we\\'ve all come to know. It\\'s an underplayed performance, nicely pitched against great actresses.Button makes some powerful points about the precious commodities of love, happiness and time.Not nearly curious enough.While I would recommend David Fincher\\'s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as worth seeing, I simply cannot work up any great love for it.While director Fincher has accomplished any number of technical marvels in the film, Benjamin Button lacks a soul.Many may see this as a more grown-up version of Forrest Gump, but it feels to me like something from the pen of Charlie Kaufman, who enjoys playing with time and conventions in much the way Fincher and Roth do here.Fincher\\'s film, based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story about a man who ages in reverse, is rambling and gorgeous -- perhaps a bit overlong and gooey in the midsection -- but one that leaves you with a lingering wistfulness.Benjamin Button is a film about the feat of its own whiz-bang, Frankensteinian digital imagery, drunk on its own accomplishment to an extent that feels quasi-ethical.The movie looks amazing. And for the first hour, when storytelling and special effects bond like lovers, it plays even better.A terrific film.The characters that come in and out of Benjamin\\'s life are distinct, memorable, and wonderfully conceived.Sentimental fantasy that packs a visual punch.It works - kind of - but it takes its sweet time in getting there and leaves little behind truly worthy of remembrance.The new eighty in Hollywood as a one year old. And by the time Pitt\\'s lover is clutching her object of erotic desire as he squirms around in her arms in diapers and all of one foot long, let\\'s just say that it\\'s more than a little on the kinky side.A relatively-morose morality play likely to land its share of accolades during award season provided everyone stops comparing it to Gump.Tantalizing, touching and timeless - an epic fable revolving around mortality.Benjamin\\'s very blankness gives the film a beguiling measure of dreamy, fabulistic wonder, one that entrances even as Roth\\'s script regularly missteps.Visually arresting but woefully short on substance David Fincher\\'s adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgearld\\'s short story about a man who ages backward is like a parlor game that wears out its welcome.The wild and wonderful adventures of an oddball outsider with a terrible physical affliction who makes the most out of his journey in the company of a lovable band of eccentrics and misfits.This is a beautifully made film ... but ... it is also a piece of cinematic artifice, in which the manufacture of it stands between it and us -- big on novelty and sentimentality but short on tension and interest for the audiencethis film is about seeing Brad Pitt grow younger and handsomer until he becomes so young and handsome that it\\'s a marvel equivalent to the launch of an Apollo rocket.Brilliant... beautiful and incredibly moving.It\\'s a speculative and enthralling fantasy about what it would be like to age in reverse.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a monumental achievement -- not only one of the best films of the year, but one of the greatest films ever made.David Fincher\\'s wildly overlong adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story misses a key point from its source material: the story should be a short one.It\\'s too bad that I can barely remember the movie after only a week. Nothing lasts, indeed.A life lived in backward progression leaves a feeling of melancholy in this accomplished realization of a novel concept.Overlong, but any film that can make Brad Pitt look homely deserves to sweep the special effects awards.Pitt\\'s trust in David Fincher proves that both richly deserve accolades for bringing magic and poignancy without sentimentality to this fantasy tale.Lyrical, original, misshapen and deeply felt, this is one flawed beauty of a movie.The most important word in the title of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is \"curious.A wildly ambitious fantasy which contains many intriguing elements and superb production values but ultimately fails to cohere as the epic tragedy it wants to be.An epic tale that contemplates the wonders of life -- of birth and death and, most of all, love.A richly satisfying serving of deep-dish Hollywood storytelling.nannannannanAlong with a terrible ending, there\\'s also a numerous range of plot inconsistencies that insult the audiences intelligence.The biggest problem I had with this film was the set-up and premise. It works on paper, but most of the movie is spent with the characters being simply awful.Battle of the sexes romcom with mature content.A modest but bubbly comedy of manners. [Blu-ray]...despite reservations about the goofy plot and the cocky characters, the movie proceeds pleasantly enough.Has just enough substance beneath the surface throw the romantic comedy some much needed freshness.[McConaughey] and Hudson make the premise, even in its shakier moments, vibrate with a sense of fun.It\\'s hard to believe that this drivel was based on a book... but Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson make it somewhat tolerable at least.Kate Hudson\\'s impressive comic flair almost saves this implausible romantic comedy.Offers nothing new to the genre, but for those who like light tales of meet-cute and happily-ever-after, it\\'ll probably be as welcome as a tub of double-fudge ice cream.The film has charm and even some grace...An offhandedly luscious vision that the actors are careful not to muss.if only filmmakers out there would take a how-to course on making romantic comedies with more than just laughs and star appeal, we might actually be making some progress.. . .a fluffy farce of romance and vulnerability - and not just the female\\'s take, but the male perspective as well.The comedy in the film works very well. The romance isn\\'t quite as convincing, but good acting and romantic chemistry prevail.. I hate to label this lightweight romp a \"chick flick\", but when the title actually issues a challenge to the fairer sex, well, the writing is on the wall.If you\\'re a bit of a romantic with a penchant for playfulness, here is a fresh and funny, entertaining collision of hearts.You gotta love love, especially when it\\'s devious, deceitful, selfish, brutal and manipulative.She plays the ninny and the harpy, the baby doll and the ball breaker. It\\'s Kate Hudson\\'s film all right, but this actress is a cold squeeze, not well photographed either, and has the worst hairdo on the East Side.... before labeling this as just another chick flick, keep in mind that it\\'s a whole lot more enjoyable than most of the current pre-summer blockbuster-wannabes that studios are unloading right now.The kind of instantly disposable but exceptionally agreeable trifle that\\'s best enjoyed with one\\'s significant other, preferably before or after an intimate dinner for two.Overly long and overstuffed, there\\'s just not enough here for a recommendation.Fun, funny, Chick Lit-style chortler.Pokes fun at relationship stereotypes in a way that, while not exactly clever, is pretty amusing -- due in large part to the talented leads.\\'Hudson y McConaughey salvan el resultado final gracias simplemente a su encanto personal.\\'This is a pure bubblegum picture, but it works at that level.This is a more adult romantic comedy, with humor that a more adult crowd can identify with, and those painful date moments that everyone can relate to.Hudson needs a little more time to hone her comedic skills before she can charm us through all the watery spots in the film\\'s hot-laughs and cold-jokes script.In what civilization is this kind of behavior romantic?Leave before the excruciating finale and you should have an OK time.It is fun, but empty fun.Both lovers are duplicitous creeps -- in a perverse way they\\'re made for each other.When a chick flick goes wrong -- and this one hits a dead end in hell -- it\\'s a wipeout.The funny stuff at the heart of this film struggles in vain to free itself from a cage made of old romantic-comedy cliches.This tortured premise to get them together and the things they go through, every minute of it just lies flat on the screen.A nice enough diversion when the theaters are filled with weightier Oscar contenders.The same stuff you\\'ve seen in every other run of the mill, artificially sweetened date flick.You\\'ve seen this movie before. Here it is again.The perfect date movie.By any impartial system of judgment, it is at best a mediocre film, but within its genre, it\\'s better than some.A cobbled-together clone of Sex and the City, minus most of the humor and poignance.The film is based on a very small book of the same name that\\'s illustrated with stick figures. Director Donald Petrie\\'s film miraculously manages to be even less detailed.Isn\\'t as bad as it looks.Resorts to the kinds of cliches that were so yesterday two weeks ago.Too light on laughs and too heavy on predictable moments.Though something less than a masterpiece of the genre, this good-natured skirmish in the war between men and women benefits from Hudson\\'s thoroughly charming performance.For once, here\\'s a screen couple that easily adds up.Virtually everything in the movie is off-pitch.So much of the picture misfires and/or simply doesn\\'t work or make sense that the total package is not as good, enjoyable or entertaining as it should be.This is a movie that never aspires to be anything more than dimwitted fun, then falls on its aspirations.It\\'s about as close to French farce as romantic comedies get, and the closer the better.Button-cute.A modest Hawn-like romance for a new generation.A funny premise in search of a movie.A shrill, unfunny litany of single-folk stereotypes that insults men and women with equal abandon.A formulaic romantic comedy that percolates slightly with caustic wit before devolving into idiocy, it\\'s potty humor.Trite, contrived, but often entertaining.This material requires a great deal more suspension of disbelief than even this hokey genre normally demands.Has enough laughs and silly subplots to keep you looking, but in the end it\\'s the work done by the two leads that saves the film.McConaughey is an actor of limited range, but this time he has a film that fits firmly into his abilities.A sure delight for both guys and gals.You not only have to be seriously testosterone- deprived to survive this film without embarrassment, you have to buy a romantic premise so ridiculously contrived that even Dr. Ruth might suspect someone was pulling her little leg.Lackluster.The movie grows formulaic and clumsy in its last third, but what you feel, sitting in a packed theater, is the spark between Hudson and the audience.It goes on too long and is trapped by too many cliches.The hottest couple to come down the pike recently has been Frodo and Sam. Hudson and McConaughey rate higher on the spark-o-meter.a shallow, convoluted love story with some cheap laughs wrapped around an infomercialA novel concept...botched with juvenile execution.Hits all the spots that most successful romantic comedies do, and has some decent laughs mixed in.The results are supposed to be funny, but are instead painful.I am just about ready to write off movies in which people make bets about whether they will, or will not, fall in love.Days is a watered-down, lightweight version of War of the Roses made for people who still think Friends is funny.Want to get rid of that guy who\\'s driving you crazy? Drag him to this lame romantic comedy starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey.Clumsy, overlong.When his mother whispers in Andie\\'s ear, \"Don\\'t you break his heart,\" the double-double-cross plot takes a backseat to the really in-love plot. They play cards, ride his motorcycle, get splashed in a puddle, have sex in the bathroom. She\\'s so cute, he\\'s sIf Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey weren\\'t so darn easy on the eyes, the only thing this \\'battle of the sexes\\' film would be losing is its audience.The picture is entertaining, and it will probably be a big hit, but it\\'s an opportunity wasted.The picture is actually watchable.They play an emotional game of chicken - and we all win.A brand of entertainment that\\'s dissatisfying intellectually and formulaically.Kate Hudson is irresistably adorable in this frothy comedy about the head-on-collision between two competing bets and one overpowering attraction.The movie would have been so much better if it had jumped into its mean-spiritedness with gusto and passion, instead of just splashing around in it halfheartedly.Despite a few clever insights and twists, it\\'s neither good nor distinctive enough to rise above the level of generic romantic comedy.If the movie provides no new insight into the contrasting behavior of men and women or the perils of postmodern urban dating, falling well shy of the not-too-high standard set by \\'Sex and the City\\' on both fronts, it does have its tart, fizzy moments.A too-long title is just the first problem for this too-long, misguided, so-called romantic comedy.Mutual deception as a comedic conceit predates Shakespeare, and it certainly shows its age in this creaker.All in all, it\\'s a mostly harmless movie and if you\\'re female and have a mean streak, you should love it. Guys should see it as a warning.... it is pretty funny, if exaggerated to cartoonish extremes and contrived beyond belief.Should just count ourselves lucky that the final reunion on a bridge doesn\\'t involve Benjamin on horseback and Paul Young on the soundtrack.If reality\\'s your bag, take a pass. But if you\\'re looking for a harmless diversion to get you in the mood for Valentine\\'s Day, this could be the ticket.There may be some way to make this nonsense amusing, but writers Kristen Buckley and Brian Regan haven\\'t even figured out a reasonable setup for getting the two together.How to Lose a Guy smoothly satirizes the superficiality of man-hungry women and the soullessness of sex-hungry men....This film will charm your socks offNot for one frame does it seem possible that these two cutesy twenty-somethings won\\'t see the errors of their wagers in time to take the exit to happily-ever-after land.She\\'s selling low self-esteem and an impossible image of femininity and he\\'s selling pieces of rock mined by slave labor and made artificially scarce by evil monopolies. Maybe they really are made for each other.With its ungainly double-deception premise, How to Lose a Guy feels like it was made out of two connect-the-dots drawings laid haphazardly on top of one another.If you want to lose a guy in one day, drag him to see this movie.Hudson is so impressive than she could charm the paint off the walls.This film sticks like high heels in gravel coming out of the gate. But after the necessary unpleasantness are over the bulk of the film is actually quite entertaining, funny and, well, cute.This movie is so intent upon getting cheap laughs and putting the protagonists in uncomfortable situations that it forgets they\\'re supposed to be falling in love.This film will likely be enjoyed by anyone who has gone through their own share of \\'clingy\\' girlfriends with a number of laughs and enough overall entertainment to recommend to anyone looking for a fun night out with their honey.A tasty romantic comedy, featuring the battle of the sexes in its most fanciful light.If you\\'re working for The New Yorker, the legality of Laura Elena Harring\\'s breasts is not an appropriate pitch for your \"Annals of Law\" column.This is the kind of movie that was doomed on the page, both by an inherently problematic premise and ill-conceived character motivations.This boy-meets-girl movie is a chore to sit through.An entertaining trifle to a point...but it doesn\\'t treat the character\\'s or the audience\\'s intelligence with the respect they deserve. By the end, you just don\\'t care anymore.nannannannannannannannannannannanIf you relish the sight of a healthy male body being systematically demolished, beyond the farthest reach of plausible endurance, The Passion of the Christ is your movie.For millions of people, Mel Gibson shows them their Jesus and their salvation.If I believed in life eternal with access to a heavenly multiplex I still wouldn\\'t advise you to see this film, but, as things stand, if thou goest anywhere this week, be it to see an honest piece of graven imagery, not this religiose rubbish.... can be read both as a literal illustration of the story of Christ\\'s suffering at the hands of the Roman... and an anti-authoritarian tract that questions the very assumptions of guilt and blame that many take for granted the film shares.Moving. Powerful. Epic. Beautiful.Extremely violent, and powerful; for mature teens.Gibson\\'s passion is all over this film...but his resorting to mawkish, superficial tactics blows the tone off-course from time to time.With a passionate zeal and the budget to back it, Mel Gibson has created a religious epic which is equally unique, inspirational, and repellent. The film\\'s lack of discretion robs the viewer of his or own conception of Christ\\'s crucifixion. It is an exploitative disservice to \"the greatest story ever told,\" that reduces that illustrious narrative to an extended torture episode.It\\'s a shame there isn\\'t a good movie deep down in this excuse for gore and sadism.It should have been called The Passionator.I emerged from The Passion of the Christ depressed and spiritually bruised.More sensational than spiritual, this blood-soaked take on the Stations of the Cross retells the Gospels as a horror movie. You can\\'t help asking: where has all the love gone?If I were a Christian, I\\'d be appalled to have this primitive and pornographic bloodbath presume to speak for me.For a filmmaker who wants to create an adaptation of the story of Jesus, Mel Gibson\\'s motives seem ironically impure.Easily the most controversial film of the year, Gibson\\'s fil is a visually bold, relentlessly violent epos that suffers from a shallow, undernourished narrative and no characterizations to speak of.By giving us the feeling of experiencing Jesus\\' thoughts, and by making us privy to his prayers, The Passion draws us toward Christ\\'s full humanity like no film before.Mr. Gibson has plucked at the rawest of nerves yet I cannot blame him. He is expressing himself through the medium of film and using the text of his bible as the basis.Director Gibson tends toward populist impulses without much artistry or invention; he prefers bombardment to poetry. A tormented movie about torment; loopy, over-reaching and occasionally suspicious. Simultaneously, it is a daring artistic endeavour.A negative and spiritually underwhelming experience.Incredibly intense, unflichingly realistic and powerfully moving...One of the all-time great cinematic achievements...God bless Mel Gibson.One of the best films of this middle-aged decade.Sick.This most human of tales is sadly lacking humanity.Father forgive them - Jesus whippedMight be mistaken for an instructional video on meat-tenderizing techniques for cannibal chefs. Mel\\'s a muscular Christian without a philosophical bone in his head.To put so much time, effort and money into something that\\'s ultimately so lifeless seems like a waste to me.I don\\'t know how non-believers will react to this, but for me it was an affirmation and strengthening of my faith.Whatever else it is -- however flawed we find it -- The Passion of the Christ is a work of art.An ambitious, great, and flawed film ... [it] reminds us that this man never quit loving us, never quit forgiving his enemies, even as they tore him to shreds. To give Gibson credit, with The Passion he\\'s passionately striving for art, trying to paint the modern equivalent of a Caravaggio canvas on an actor\\'s body. But in a world engulfed by holy war, it\\'s one scary picture.Mel Gibson, the Lord love him--and I believe He does, has succeeded in producing the first major motion picture ever that is both spiritually and historically challenging.Those with a spiritually vibrant personal relationship to the story may find it as affirming as it is oppressive.It\\'s like a bloody Renaissance painting come to life. But the DVD is a disappointment....the director spends so much time recounting in minute and realistic detail the agony of Christ that he neglects the stronger, spiritual message, of love and kindness.A powerful, artistic expression of one of the most pivotal moments in the Christian religion.Dead languages and horrific violence aside, this is a film everyone should see, whether they hold any religious beliefs or not.More of a bludgeon of evangelism than a work of art.As a work of devotion and faith, \"The Passion\" is a success. As a piece of filmmaking, it is a failure.A work that is as horrifying as it is beautiful, as disturbing as it is gratifying, and as powerful as it is controversial.Una cinta por instantes hermosa, casi siempre demoledora, pero sin duda alguna, profundamente pasional.The Passion of the Christ is the Jesus story that\\'s been begging to get made since Charlie Heston kicked off his robes and sandals.Whether you enjoy the film or not, it is undeniably something that will generate good discussion and that makes it worth checking out.It\\'s almost impossible not to be moved by Jim Caviezel\\'s vulnerability as Christ, even if the idea that he is no \\'mere\\' man is never in doubt.Hey, I don\\'t believe it literally, but it is a movie, after all -- it\\'s a great story, too, certainly as compelling as \"Dead Man Walking.Gibson turns the thing into a bloody shock spectacle; he implicates the viewers like the Jews who watched the crucifixion and beatings as entertainment.I found the film more numbing than moving, as if the transformation it charted was not from human to divine, but from man to carcass.And any power these explicit scenes have is in any case undermined by the absurd tweeness of the final moments.It\\'s a head-bashing experience, by turns exhausting, exhilarating, and infuriating.I wanted to be moved. Really, I did. A lot. Instead, I left cold. like a ballet where physical movements are used to show pain, heartache, evil and sufferingThe entire event is gut-wrenching, but Mel Gibson makes a movie that gives you the guts without the wrench. His Jesus is a whipping post.Beautiful, violent -- and also funny for all the wrong reasons, and boring.If you want to get offended by a Mel Gibson movie, nothing is worse than the portrayal of slavery in The Patriot. Yeah, everyone is a happy free voluntary worker.The Passion\" is big, physical, violent and unflinching. It\\'s unlike any biblical film ever made and it\\'s impossible to watch it with a trace of passivity.When audiences walk out of theaters in stunned silence, I\\'m not sure it is for the same reasons director Mel Gibson wanted.This problem of truth -- how it might be defined, known, or told -- underlies most all of Mel Gibson\\'s film.pretentious cinematography and gritty realism aside, there\\'s not a whole lot in this torture chamber to be passionate aboutA high-gloss exploitation picture, obsessed with the Death Jesus conquered, rather than the Life he gave -- and gives.[Gibson\\'s] film, virtually stripped of Jesus\\'s incandescent views, is little more that a record of one of the thousands of barbarities committed by the Romans in Judea.If Gibson imagined that this extended detailing of sadism would somehow be inspirational, he needs to be taken off his biblical steroids.Gibson is just like all the other hateful men who\\'ve been successful -- he\\'s the right guy at the right weak moment. There\\'s no denying Gibson\\'s passion in bringing his vision to the screen, no matter how dodgy his religious beliefs.The Passion of the Christ is something of a masterpiece, terrible to behold, unfit for children, certainly, but very much the work of a director in the throes of his own distinct passion.Overall this is a remarkably unremarkable film, lacking in subtlety and enshrouded in that depressing sense of Catholic guilt which Gibson no doubt wrestles with every night.Passion might be a courageous, visceral, boldly artistic motion picture, but that it doesn\\'t make a very convincing dramatic experience.Gibson may have given us the most profitable version of this story ever made, but he\\'s also given us the most amateurish, absurd, politically suspect and obsessively violent.While this is clearly the most controversial film of the year, but I also happen to think it might also be the its most brilliant as well.Like my reviews for the \"Harry Potter\" series, my review of \"The Passion of the Christ\" will come from the perspective of someone who has not read The Book.This is the True Gibson Story version of the death of Christ, in all is re-created gory.This is one of the most powerful and emotional films I have ever seen.Takes one of mankind\\'s key tales of grace and redemption and reduces it to horror.The style and mode are a little too heterogeneous to come together right, even though some images have a pared-down majesty, and the main line of the film is tough.Is Gibson trying somehow to shock us into believing?Gibson\\'s artistic intentions and interpretation of the gospels have created a film that is both moving and horrifying.If Art is to be measured by how it provokes, The Passion of the Christ may end up being the closest thing to Art we see in our lifetime.General Jesus Christ is reborn, awarded the most earned Purple Heart in history, and summons his Christian soldiers to march forth and fight whatever battles He calls us to.As a film for true believers, Passion is zealously self-righteous....In the beginning was the word, and the word was agony.The power of spectacle overrides spiritual insight.Mr. Gibson has gone to a lot of sweat and expense to make a movie that doesn\\'t say much of anything new.Whereas the words say love, love, love, the sounds and images say hate, hate, hate.It\\'s not an instructive or illuminating experience...but a visceral and vicious one. [I]t\\'s Mel Gibson on a bloody pulpit preaching to the converted.The movie\\'s biggest sin lies not in where it chooses to cast blame, but in its bungled attempt at manufacturing what I suppose you\\'d have to call an epiphany of excess.\\'Is Mel Gibson \"wacko?\" ... You\\'d have to be wacked out of your mind to cultivate the desire to create the most realistic depiction of the crucifixion in the history of cinema.\\'From a technical standpoint, the film is impressive. From a narrative or message-bringing standpoint, it left me wanting. And the violence....Gibson has basically taken the greatest story ever told and turned it into a snuff film ... It\\'s Kill Bill for the churchgoing crowd.In a world that has lost grasp of the real values in life, The Passion of the Christ is a timely piece that makes you reflect on the true worth of faith and love.As a film it is nothing but a long third act with no story and, most importantly, NO character development for anyone other than Pilate.Gibson\\'s obsession with the pain and suffering of Jesus, sublime and terrible, does not transubstantiate into spirituality; rather, the brutality of his film at first repels, then numbs, and finally titillates.If Gibson\\'s central wish was for people to discuss Jesus, mission accomplished. If you can manage to disregard the hype, you\\'ll witness a wonderfully made film.a film about the last hours of Christ that is both reverent, but also frighteningly realistic and frequently daringA story of betrayal and vindictiveness leading to a mind-numbing gorefest that provokes exhaustion more than it inspires the \\'tolerance, love and forgiveness\\' which is one of Gibson\\'s stated aims.It\\'s too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously.This is a powerful film.Until things get splatter-film bloody and Christ starts looking like a Jackson Pollock painting with exposed ribs, The Passion seems inspired less by the Holy Trinity than by Gibson\\'s other favorite trio, the Three Stooges.If Gibson\\'s use of blood and violence makes his audience squirm in their seats and allows the audience to question his film - then he\\'s done his job as a filmmaker...\\'The Passion of the Christ\\' invigorates because Gibson\\'s artistic choices have serious theological implications.Gibson has too much belligerence in him to capture the Prince of Peace at His and our most glorious moment.I expected to leave my viewing of the film feeling battered and bruised, but instead I felt very peaceful. Seeing the strength required for forgiveness uplifted me.For moviegoers who don\\'t share Mel Gibson\\'s religious agenda, it\\'s nothing but an unpleasant experience.The Passion is a beautiful film, but an empty one.Powerful and heart-wrenching, gorgeous to look at, and fascinating to contemplate. All issues of religion aside, those components generally result in a film worth seeing.It is a film worth seeing and talking about, for better or worse. It gets some things very right, but the violence threatens to overshadow the message.It\\'s tough not to describe without using the word \"powerful.\" For pure cinematic artistry it\\'s a masterpiece showing man\\'s inhumanity to man, or in this case, the Son of ManThe Passion of the Christ is painstakingly true to its source material, neither editorializing nor embellishing upon what is taught each week in thousands upon thousands of churches across the globe.Puts us in a situation where we can\\'t help but feel Jesus\\'s pain. If only Gibson had taken the time to tell more of us why it mattered.Watching this is a shocking, grim, harrowing experience. Audiences should leave in the spirit of exaltation; instead, they\\'re simply exhausted.Gibson ... seems determined to prove that Jesus suffered more than anyone who has ever lived, a tiresomely literal argument at best, an exercise in sadomasochistic bullying at worst.A very dour, pedestrian picture.Poetic filmmaking drawing on--and continuing--a long tradition of religious art.To see The Passion of the Christ is to feel brutalized.Whatever demons fueled Mel Gibson\\'s longtime passion to mount this work, no redemption is to be found in the one-dimensional result.It\\'s a crucifiction.Despite Gibson\\'s efforts to hide Caviezel\\'s European heritage behind a prosthetic nose and darkened eyes, Jesus comes off looking like all other movie depictions-Whitewashed.No other film in history has even attempted such a concentrated interpretation of these unimaginable events let alone do so with what I call such reverential explicitness.an inspiring film, no matter what your faith. Unrelentingly anti-Semitic, excessively grotesque and overly narrow in its scopeHow you react to it depends mostly on what you take in with you.Emerging from the Job-like endurance test of this film\\'s unrelenting horror, it\\'s impossible not to be moved by its visceral impact ...How anyone could call Gibson\\'s filmic account anti-Semitic is mindboggling in its confused narrow-mindedness.Passion affords exactly the moviegoing experience Gibson intended: an appreciation of Christ\\'s sacrifice via an explicit rendering of his suffering.A triumphant masterpiece. Is Gibson this millennium\\'s Saint Paul?Mel Gibson\\'s labor of love about the death of Jesus is incredibly labored, recasting his Crucifixion in crimson, slo-mo cliches.Retains a real sense of power. Its message never wavers, always visible beneath the gore.As a film -- and more importantly, as a document of faith -- it is a dismayingly simplistic, obvious, overbearing waste remarkable only for the quantities of blood it spills.Has such anti-Semitic possibilities and no upside for anyone but believers in Mel\\'s vision that the execution of Christ is more important than his life.... a powerful presentation.A high-art snuff film...an unhealthy, inhuman, pornographic, masochistic torture mechanism.Amid the controversy and accusations of excessive violence that surrounds Mel Gibson\\'s The Passion of the Christ lies a good movie.As a religious experience, The Passion of the Christ makes a damn fine movie.After all the debate about this film...what Gibson has delivered is his own passionate vision.A two-hour bloodbath.This is a movie so singular, so intense, so overwhelming that it simply has to be experienced.Emotional, violent, extreme and very gory, Mel Gibson\\'s controversial The Passion of the Christ is a difficult and grotesque experience for most viewers.Does one really have to so debase Christ\\'s story in order to make it relevant to today\\'s audiences?Jesus stumbles under the weight of the cross so many times, you begin to swear the editors are recycling the same footage over and over again.It will spare you no mercy....up there with the greatest films of the genre, [although] the director\\'s approach may be somewhat excessive in terms of violence.The overriding virtue...is the film\\'s conviction in its own material.I can\\'t bring myself to condemn this film... [Gibson] made the film he was inspired to make, which included writing, directing, producing, financing and marketing [it] himselfIt\\'s not the second coming of Christ, but it\\'s a finely crafted piece of work that should not be missed.One cannot rely on any critic for this film because a biased opinion lies behind every review.Religion is always a delicate and personal issue, but great filmmaking is great filmmaking, period.the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach inkblot: You will probably see in it whatever you choose to see in it. A film of artistic ambition and devotion.Gibson makes many of the key scenes work.Does have its share of very powerful moments, and it boasts some strong performances. Whether audience members will be able to concentrate on them amid the ultra-realistic and excruciating violence, however, is questionable.There are scenes in The Passion that will remain forever with those who see it.A filmed bloodletting like no other on record, essentially a terribly graphic two-hour torture sequence.Even though it is relentlessly intense, at times even deeply moving, The Passion ultimately leaves you numb.Controversy aside, The Passion is ultimately a movie -- and a masterful one at that, obviously the work of an extremely talented filmmaker.It\\'s just bad storytelling.The director claims he had no intention of making an anti-Semitic film and we tend to believe him, in much the same way we believe Larry Flynt when he says he\\'s not misogynist.Will rightfully be considered a landmark achievement not only for the passionate responses it is causing but because Gibson was able to give one of the oldest and best-known stories in literature such contemporary resonance and power.One thing is certain: Gibson has delivered a film so visceral, so unwavering in his commitment, that it makes most other Jesus movies look pale and tepid.One of the things that happens while you watch a man slowly beaten to death is that the fact of his life is reinforced. This happened, Gibson is saying.In expressing his own blend of masochism and piety, Mel Gibson may well have created a Jesus uniquely apt for our time: bloodied, tormented, alienated and alone.Gibson has made an extraordinary, focused movie with blinders on, showing mostly one color -- blood-red -- from the full Christian spectrum.Bloody to the point of gruesome, moving without being inspiring.Working with premier cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, Gibson effectively hurls us into Christ\\'s living nightmare, creating a mesmerizing twilight zone that is creepy and utterly unforgettable.Jesus Christ is remote, a Superman among men, and his teardrops shake the earth.A labor of conviction that comes remarkably close to faith-based sadism.Instead of letting his reverence broaden him, Gibson uses his action-movie expertise to reduce the Crucifixion to something kinetic, literal and merely tragic.Gibson ultimately seems to be preaching to the choir, rejecting standard storytelling conventions such as introducing his characters, assuming his audience already knows everything he\\'s about to tell us.\\'A Biblical snuff film\\'You may not believe in the events that transpire in The Passion of the Christ, but it\\'s hard to deny the grim potency with which they\\'ve been captured.Powerful and upsetting.What graphic sex is to the use of the body in hardcore porno, graphic violence is to destruction of the body of Christ in this Passion.Never dull -- no mean feat, given that it spends two hours telling a story whose end is widely known -- and features performances that range from coarsely effective to phenomenal.May have succeeded in exploiting Jesus\\'s death for its most highly pitched emotion and drama. But in the process, for many believers, it may have served only to trivialize and further obscure the story\\'s most central and sacred mysteries.As it plays out, the brutality brings about more numbing revulsion than the revelatory empathy that Mel Gibson intends.Gibson places his faith in Christ\\'s suffering, and is determined to make the moviegoer suffer in Jesus\\' name as well.Gibson has made a movie for nobody, really, but Gibson.Diminishing returns set in after the first series of beating, but the film is a stunner, a must-see whatever your beliefs.Blood-soaked pop theology for a doom-laden time, its effect that of a gripping yet reductive paradox: It lifts us downward.Overall, it\\'s just another movie, and it can be dismissed with the same short critique we so often apply to other movies: The book was better.By turning the Greatest Story Ever Told into the Goriest Story Ever Told, director Mel Gibson breaks the filmmaking commandment Thou Shall Not Overkill.In the Gospel According to Mel Gibson, blood doesn\\'t lie. It\\'s the only truth that exists. Which means the agony is the ecstacy in The Passion of the Christ.It definitely makes the viewer suffer--but it\\'s debatable if by itself that\\'s a truly enlightening contribution to one\\'s understanding of Christ\\'s message.[A] stunning film, sometimes remarkably moving - at times sublimely beautiful, often sickeningly brutal, but never banal, nor specifically blameful.As a movie, it feels incomplete - yes, it\\'s incredibly intense and powerful, but I wanted to see a little more about the compassionate man and a little less bloodshed.Lost in a labyrinth of stomach-churning pugilism, the spectacle is a hefty cross for audiences to bear.As a work of cinema, The Passion of the Christ possesses a majestic beauty within its horror, one that comes most effectively through a tiny, solitary teardrop.Bears the same relation to other biblical epics as a charnel house does to your local deli.Although it\\'s very good at showing Jesus\\' suffering, the movie treats him as a propSo obsessively and so graphically bloody-minded that it comes perilously close to the pornography of violence.A very specific film made for a very specific audience.One of the most overpowering experiences I\\'ve ever had in a movie theater, the film is a brutal, blood-soaked plea for compassion and forgiveness in the face of monstrosity.The Passion of the Christ is a rare thing indeed, then: a work of art that succeeds as a film, as a message, and, yes, as a labor of love.The most compelling message of this unflinching, powerful, and haunting movie is that in Jesus\\' name we are obligated to extend our compassion to victims everywhere.This is a good film, well-made, well-told and it is clearly a personal triumph for Mel Gibson.The Passion of the Christ is a tremendous FILM and if you look at it through those eyes you may believe that too. If what you are looking for is an overwrought, hyper-violent reenactment of Jesus\\' final hours, that is what you will get here, and no more.I kept thinking: WHen is this going to be over? This is not an easy movie to watch.The Passion of the Christ, while not a perfect film, will touch many emotions in those who see it. Some people may be offended, while others may be inspired. Irrespective of your religious beliefs, Mel Gibson\\'s brutal depiction of the most renowned story of sacrifice and love is distressing to the very core.The Passion of the Christ plays like a blend of a political-theology lesson and a snuff film.The bottom line is that The Passion of the Christ is an astonishing cinematic achievement, utterly riveting from start to finish.Despite controversies swirling around the movie, one cannot deny that Gibson has made a stunning film, beautifully photographed in contrasting dark and golden hues by Caleb Deschanel.Watching it is an act of self-flagellation.This is a two-hour-and- six-minute snuff movie -- The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre -- that thinks it\\'s an act of faith.Strangely remote and uninvolving on both emotional and spiritual levels.A gripping, powerful motion picture -- arguably the most forceful depiction of Jesus\\' death ever to be committed to film.Regardless of how you feel about the movie\\'s message, you\\'re certain to leave the movie feeling something about the movie itself.A dramatically powerful statement.Controversy over whether it will inflame anti-Semitism guarantees huge audiences, and many people may be profoundly moved. But as a film it is quite bad.Controversy aside, it is dramatically intense, skillfully constructed and often harrowing, in ways that should have an impact on people of any or no particular faith.The Passion of the Christ is at once a well-crafted film, a merciless excursion into motion-picture ultraviolence, and a regrettably cramped historical account that stays doggedly on the surface of its overwhelmingly important subject.It leaves one with the impression of a human race so violent it justifies all the fears critics have expressed about potential modern-day reactions to the film.The Passion of the Christ is so relentlessly focused on the savagery of Jesus\\' final hours that this film seems to arise less from love than from wrath, and to succeed more in assaulting the spirit than in uplifting it.The ultimate contradiction ... is that a film about the Prince of Peace is violent enough to earn an R rating.Less reverential than razzle-dazzlin\\', more an episode in the history of show business than a religious epiphany....captivating and provocative in its exquisite spirit. The Passion of the Christ is an ambitious and visceral undertaking that demands acceptance.Shockingly violent, chock full of scenes drenched in blood, this movie earns its R rating many times over.Preaching to the choir and doing so in shorthand.As a true reading of the Gospels -- the director\\'s much-vaunted aim -- the film falls abruptly short.The Passion doesn\\'t suffer from the airless, pious airs that drag down most biblical dramas: It has a muscular, pounding energy and lyrical, almost gothic beauty.If you come seeking theological subtlety, let alone such modern inventions as psychological depth, you\\'ll walk away battered and empty-handed.Intense.It\\'s as if Gibson is measuring God\\'s love by the amount of blood he shows on the screen.If Jesus actually received the amount of punishment dished out in this film, he would have been dead three times over before arriving at Calvary. Impressive filmmaking -- but it takes a lot of wincing to watch Mel Gibson\\'s version of this powerful story.Saturated with vengeance, betrayal, and melodrama, Mel Gibson\\'s sadistic take on Jesus\\' final twelve hours screams bloody murder.Mel Gibson\\'s personal vision of the persecution and death of Christ is relentless, brutal... and brilliant.I was moved by the depth of feeling, by the skill of the actors and technicians, by their desire to see this project through no matter what.An unquestionable work of conviction that should outlast the controversy and trigger constructive dialogue for years to come.Mel Gibson\\'s Passion, though well-acted, technically impressive and initially moving, is for the most part not beautiful and certainly not ennobling.An impressive, ultra-violent -- and deeply troubling -- take on Jesus\\' final hours.A film so narrowly focused as to be inaccessible for all but the devout.In the end, one can respect Gibson\\'s high intentions and dedicated work, while remaining spiritually and dramatically unmoved by the result.Serves as a powerful condemnation of any organized religion that aspires to governance or allow clerics to preach contempt and whip sheepish followers into a frenzy.Mel Gibson shows once again that he\\'s skilled at depicting violence. But you\\'d be hard pressed to find evidence of \\'tolerance, love and forgiveness\\' that the producer-director-co-writer insists he\\'s trying to communicate.The basic message of Christianity -- love your brother -- is obscured under torrents of blood to the point of benumbing the audience.Gravely intense and the work of a man as deeply committed to his subject as one could hope for or, for that matter, want.[Gibson] has made a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment.The movie Gibson has made from his personal obsessions is a sickening death trip, a grimly unilluminating procession of treachery, beatings, blood, and agony.The Passion of the Christ is powerfully moving and fanatically obtuse in equal doses.Using ancient languages, vivid images and visceral violence, Gibson has brought new life to one of civilization\\'s oldest narratives.This graphic depiction of the crucifixion of Christ misses any spiritual meaning to this seismic event.Instead of being moved by Christ\\'s suffering, or awed by his sacrifice, I felt abused by a filmmaker intent on punishing an audience, for who knows what sins.This is the most powerful, important and by far the most graphic interpretation of Christ\\'s final hours ever put on film.An all-consuming force. It never lets up.It is difficult to know who would want to see a film this violent.There\\'s no doubt that Jim Caviezel was put through the wringer here, and he gives a spiritual performance that\\'s offset by the physical ordeal he had to endure during the torture scenes and the crucifixion.nannannannanBased on a true story. Unlike Inglourious Basterds.Valkyrie is another entry into Cruise\\'s canon of quality films and performances.Valkyrie isn\\'t a classic war movie by any means, but is it the total laughing stock many feared? Nein.Valkyrie, as field-commanded by director Bryan Singer, succeeds on its own terms as a handsome hybrid of conspiracy thriller and history lesson, of Mission: Impossible and The Day of the Jackal.If there\\'s one thing Cruise knows how to portray, it\\'s robotic single-mindedness.Counterbalancing the energy vacuum that is Cruise is the good news that this is also a Bryan Singer movie.Cruise, Singer, lose the credibility battle.the action is traded for suspense in the movie, which is when things really clickSinger can only touch on the surface of each development. It would help if we could see the failure reflected in von Stauffenberg\\'s one good eye, but Cruise, alas, can offer little help. He\\'s just Tom Cruise in an eyepatch.Maintaining tension in the face of a foregone conclusion is no mean trick, but Mr. Singer and company do as well as anyone could hope.It\\'s never a pretty sight when a limited performer tries to \"stretch\" by way of cosmetics[Cruise] looks about as German as Jackie Chan would in a lederhosen.It\\'s the perfect film for our age of reassessment and ambiguity.Earnest and understated movie about the General\\'s plot against Hitler. Despite Cruise\\'s reputation for derring-do characters, this is a very human German colonel that he plays....finally can\\'t help but come off as something of a minor disappointment...The movie proceeds to show how everything, little by little, falls out of place -- not the most thrilling of events to cover, but interesting all the same.An interminable costume drama strictly for Tom Cruise fans and for World War II buffs.The movie looks good and seems to hit all the right notes, yet never quite connects or resonates like it should.A thrilling political war movie that sees Tom Cruise and a stellar British cast of high-ranking German officers plot to assassinate Hitler and end the war before the Germany they love is destroyed.A well-wrought thriller about one group\\'s attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler.The tension that builds throughout Valkyrie is palpable and the plot is incredibly compelling.A historically respectful, morally careful film.With a more intelligent and taut screenplay, Valkyrie could have been much more riveting rather than merely be sporadically thrilling, mostly bland and, ultimately, underwhelming.When he is at the top of his game, as he is here, Cruise\\'s charisma is blinding.The subject demands to be made as a documentary or in a form more imaginative than a linear narrative.Valkyrie isn\\'t a great war movie, but within its own limited ambitions, it is enjoyable and never dull.Although the casting of Cruise takes some getting used to, the film makes ample use of a strong supporting cast and a tightly knit story to maintain suspense.A film more concerned with \\'how\\' than \\'why\\' or \\'who\\', Valkyrie would have benefited from more scrutiny and complexity. Still, once the bomb goes off, the thrills come in spades.As old-fashioned historical escapism goes, this is solid, compelling stuff.Valkyrie\\'s technique is admirable but it misses the mark emotionally.Singer makes a noble and romantic fist of this terrific story but it feels spookily like a well-oiled Hollywood entertainment rather than a sensational chapter of history.Director Bryan Singer has put together a fairly workable, old-fashioned second world war movie.This is no The Day of the Jackal. It\\'s functional. Respectful rather than inspired. It won\\'t damage Cruise\\'s reputation, but it won\\'t enhance it in any degree either.Valkyrie may not be awards bait but it is a solid, at times gripping, thriller that wrings every ounce of drama out of what is, at heart, a pulsating tale of the courage and idealism of some undone by the cowardice and politics of others.Expect thrills, not a revolution.Valkyrie is no action extravaganza. Yet despite having a rich seam of moral ambiguity to mine, the characterisation is no deeper than in Singer\\'s X-Men.There\\'s a whiff of pointlessness hanging over this whole affair. The fact that Valkyrie is not the thriller the trailer promises is treason against the talent.Valkyrie it\\'s a good film with more than enough there to keep your attention and for you to have come away feeling satisfied and informed.I was never bored, and the period detail is lovingly observed; but there is a sense of an opportunity missed.It is no classic but it is stylish, absorbing and wonderfully put together.The film survives some dodgy dialogue because of a strong supporting cast.Valkyrie seems more like history by Nintendo: a slickly devised exercise in action drama whose entire research and development budget went into the external details of the plot, leaving none for the inner realism of its participants.Singer marshals his camera and soundtrack well as his tense, behind-the-scenes chess game plays out...It feels no more authentic than Stauffenberg\\'s glass eyeball.In the end, despite him playing someone with a missing eye, it\\'s a vanity project for Cruise - a heavyweight historical drama to put him back on the map, but one that only sees him more lost.Everyone does a jolly good job, including X-Men director Bryan Singer, as the conspiracy plot offers adequate tension and bores sturdily onwards.The end result, however, is a skewed picture that manages to promote Hollywood-style derring-do and make fascism look more stylish and profound than it has done in years.Another astonishing true story gets the Hollywood treatment and ends up being rather flattened in the processA slick, starry thriller that entertains for the full two-hour running time without threatening to do much more than that.Cruise is, well, Cruise with an eye patch. Like the film, he isn\\'t great but not bad either.It does feel more like a throwback to a time when studio films weren\\'t ruthlessly divvied up as prestige pictures or blockbusters.X-Men fans may disagree, but this is Singer\\'s best work since The Usual Suspects.It\\'s a testament to Christopher McQuarrie\\'s cogent, keenly observed script and Singer\\'s tightly controlled direction that the film remains so utterly compelling.A well-paced thriller that sheds light on a little-known piece of World War II history.Kevin Irwin - Cruise is stomachable and the production is grandly ambitious, but it\\'s the gripping true story that triumphs as the real star.It highlights a little-known historical event and gives the German Resistance the respect it deserves.Valkyrie\" is an anachronistic movie that wants to be less than it should be.Handsomely mounted but undistinguished...On all counts, this is an extraordinary story and the film, although it begins too earnestly and filled with its own importance, develops into a mostly riveting one, especially in its final hour.Claus\\'s ElevenUltimately it is redeemed by its palpably clammy sense of foreboding, plus its offering of a valuable history lesson.Tom Cruise\\'s ego-driven \"Look at me; aren\\'t I heroic?\" performance detracts, but it\\'s just too compelling and the other performances too pitch-perfect for this to ruin things.Much of Valkyrie works, but not quite enough.Put away the knives aimed at Cruise and just enjoy the solid work he keeps putting out.As the film eschews self-importance, it engages more directly and universally, if only in a rudimentary fashion that fails in terms of overall staying power.Surely there is some middle ground between a history lesson and mindless action-adventure. The people who made Valkyrie not only didn\\'t find that ground; they weren\\'t even looking for it.This is chew-your-fingernails country. Anyone who misses it simply because it stars a couch-jumping Scientologist is missing a great film.Singer and his collaborators have decided to present what ought to be an exciting story with frankly comic solemnity.There is an urgent you-are-there magnetism, each fateful mistake and misstep foreshadowing the group\\'s ultimate demise only adding to the slowly building excitement.The top priority of Bryan Singer\\'s film is not to be a history lesson or character study but to simply be an absorbing adult suspense film.Valkyrie works as a full-dress military drama, fleshing out a historical footnote in vivid detail.Overall, I really liked this film, and I hope that people check it out in the admittedly crowded holiday season.An awkward mix of plodding history and general adequacy, with occasional flourishes of visual panache that seem to be from some other, more stylish movie.Knowing the ending robs the film of some of the suspense, but Cruise and company have made a better movie than expectedTalk about an impossible mission: Tom Cruise plays a German WWII Colonel with plans to assassinate Hitler in this distractingly anachronistic fact-based tale from Bryan Singer.It is a well-made film that raises timeless questions about the demands of military duty when they are placed in conflict with higher principles.Sure, it\\'s complicated to set up the assassination of a lunatic dictator, but does it have to be so boring?The actors don\\'t interact so much as issue pronouncements, and there\\'s not a hint of levity to distract from the gravity of the situation.What the film really has going for it is a good supporting cast. Actors playing von Stauffenberg\\'s fellow conspirators include Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp.What if this lesser-known chapter of German resistance had been more deeply captured? What if the moral conflicts running through this movie about love of country and revolt said more about Germany, war and, yes, genocide?Singer keeps the conspiracy racing to its fated conclusion.As a suspense movie, this works pretty well.It\\'s slickly executed, handsomely acted for the most part and utterly easy to forget.Following Hitchcock\\'s \\'bomb under the desk\\' dictum to the bitter end just doesn\\'t work out to anyone\\'s satisfaction here.Gets off to a slow start, but it\\'s almost like Valkyrie had a Red Bull mid way through as everything is kicked up a notchWill likely not go down as one of Cruise\\'s most rewarding moneymakers, though it may become one of his more memorable contributions to the archives.Valkyrie has all the dramatic oomph of a History Channel re-enactment.Valkyrie is made with impeccable professionalism and, flying in the face of years of Internet hysteria, is a perfectly acceptable motion picture. The only thing that keeps it from even greater accomplishments may be inherent in the story itself.The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander introduces a seemingly endless series of characters, but there\\'s no time to flesh any of them out enough to make you worry about their fate.The stilted and diffuse result is as dramatically compelling as a planning commission meeting.Valkyrie doesn\\'t whip you up like that Jewish vigilante avenger picture Defiance, but in this season of throat-grabbing Holocaust movies, its gentlemanliness is most welcome.Valkyrie transforms World War II into a boy\\'s adventure.There are some powerful moments and [it\\'s] an interesting true story.Everybody is I think is good in the film, except Tom Cruise.The problem is not that we know the outcome. The problem is the buildup.Despite its potential to be a turkey for the ages, Singer\\'s blandly proficient historical thriller is fatally forgettable.Valkyrie is a highly intelligent and deeply engrossing historical drama and, frame for frame, the year\\'s most suspenseful nail-biter.You just can\\'t quite enter the world of this film, not in the way that you might have if a more nuanced and less iconic actor had played the central role.Mr. Cruise\\'s performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible, though unexceptional, while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural, impressively staged in historical locations.Valkyrie is a brutally efficient bit of storytelling, and it makes no unforced errors.Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.A taut, suspenseful WWII thriller. Bryan Singer\\'s exhaustive research pays off by lending this film a stylistic \\'period\\' feel.Meticulous reconstruction of a real-life plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler in the last months of World War II, minus tension or pacing.What you miss in both Defiance and Valkyrie is inner conflict. Their protagonists have not an instant of self-doubt. They\\'re figures in historical pageants, not characters in a drama.Tom Cruise delivers.Stripped of the over the top special effects that have driven Cruise\\'s most successful vehicles Valkyrie doesn\\'t offer much in its place.Gets off to a slow start, but once it gets going, it\\'s one of the more fascinating thrillers in recent memory, even though everyone who paid attention in history class will know exactly how it turns out.A bit shallow but undeniably thrilling.Sometimes, conspiracies are more than just theories.Actually quite good. This is a nice tense political thriller that sticks fairly closely to history.The films in this vein that work are the ones who can make you care, even though you know the struggle is futile.The film like the conceived plot to kill Hitler is commendable for its premise, but is also not well-executed.The performances truly stand out, led by Tom Cruise and several members of the supporting cast.Cruise, who already delivered a great performance this summer in \"Tropic Thunder,\" is at the top of his game hereDirector Bryan Singer approaches this sensitive material as a strict procedural. It\\'s almost as if we are joining part two of a miniseries already in progress.Other than an unconvincing Tom Cruise, this is interesting and well done, especially if you are among the apparent multitudes who don\\'t know anything about this event.It\\'ll probably be wicked suspenseful for anybody who didn\\'t pay attention in history class.Decent enough action-thriller even with poor Tom\\'s baggage.To Singer\\'s credit, the film is remarkably suspenseful, even though we know pretty much how it will end.It\\'s ironic that a film about an attempt that had some pretty serious flaws feels like its creators made a few mistakes of their own.Don\\'t believe the negative hype. Valkyrie is a stupendous film, and represents two of the most exciting hours I spent in a theater this year.Bryan Singer makes this movie possible, filled with great suspense and amazing actors. This film is on my short list as one of the year\\'s best.Valkyrie\\'s brawny and big and bold, but it\\'s also stronger, slicker and smarter than you\\'d think.Valkyrie\\'s suspense isn\\'t of the rousing, creep-to-the-edge-of-your-seat variety. The film is cold, metallic; the tension it creates is more akin to dread.Valkyrie\" is nowhere near the outright bomb that many assumed that it would be. That said, it should be noted that the film is also nowhere near the gripping cinematic experience that it should have been given the subject matter.The movie is shallow and clinical. It rarely lets us inside its protagonists. We know that they despise Hitler, period, and that they consider themselves patriots. ...Thanks mostly to fine work by its great cast, Valkyrie is not a loss and has some riveting moments, but it\\'s not the scintillating wartime thriller it could have been.Achieves the authenticity of something that the History Channel would be proud of.a riveting military drama, a popcorn thriller masquerading as a political potboileValkyrie offers something to filmgoers weary of excessive pretense, but not quite desperate enough to watch Jim Carrey flop around on the ground.Thriller and action elements are low-scale and unsuccessful. Valkyrie is little more than a sketchy and narrow history lesson with less impact than it should have.The film is a minor Christmas miracle: It succeeds on its own terms, despite the gossip hounds\\' best blood-sniffing efforts, and dares to be an entertainment rather than a statement.Valkyrie is a World War II thriller without enough thrills.Like the coup whose story it tells, Valkyrie is a near miss, failing to sweep us along for what should have been a dramatic ride.Cruise\\'s character, Claus von Stauffenberg, is off-putting and not just because he\\'s a German with a pronounced American accent.For a thriller with a thoroughly foreordained outcome, Valkyrie does a pretty good job at making the viewer\\'s palms sweat.Bryan Singer has capably crafted this war thriller in such a way that one occasionally forgets the foregone conclusion and becomes wrapped up in the excitement of the moment.On one hand, it\\'s kind of silly, on the other, these are very fine actors, and give this super-slick thriller some of the facets and angles that help make a cool object at which to gaze.Singer has a masterful touch with composition, creating tension simply by the way he places his actors around a room. And even though we know how it turned out, the assassination plot remains a gripping tale.That last part makes for quite a good, crackling suspense thriller, meticulously researched in all details by the perfectionist Singer.It may be the same old partners but it\\'s a better dance -- here, at least, history leads and Hollywood follows.It\\'s a crafty action flick with a pristine cast that works, ever so briefly, as a wish-fulfillment fantasy.With just the slightest tilt toward black comedy, Valkyrie could have been the Dilbert of Nazi movies....like Cruise\\'s performance, an overall restraint keeps the heroic story behind \"Valkyrie\" from soaring as high as it should.Director Bryan Singer keeps the pace fast, and although we know the ultimate outcome, it\\'s easy to get caught up in the excitement of what-if thinking.If you don\\'t mind the fluctuation in focus, if the tripwire midsection can get your through the labored last act, Valkyrie will be a solid success.Singer does a superb job at creating suspense in a story where everyone in the audience already knows the outcome.It rarely rises to the level of entertainment you expect from a wartime thriller -- there\\'s something rote and foregone about the whole affair.Valkyrie feels like another installment in the never-ending franchise -- not just the action-movie one, but the Tom Cruise one. Like the operation itself, it\\'s a good idea -- just not well-executed.A thoroughly respectable historical re-enactment, though lacking the epic scope and dramatic urgency that would make it a truly memorable one.When it hooks into the filmgoer, the mix of classic thriller tones and Singer\\'s invigorating compositional rhythms brings Valkyrie to an impressive boil.Valkyrie is like having to watch someone build a bomb and then never getting to see it explode.Based on a true story, Valkyrie aims to be a thriller, not an issues movie, and it succeeds.What\\'s next, Clint Eastwood as Gandhi?Valkyrie is a taut suspense flick for grown-ups that asks: What if ruthless German efficiency had been used against Hitler?A meticulous thriller based on a large-scale conspiracy within the German army to assassinate Hitler.In Cruise\\'s hands, von Stauffenberg comes off as a very human window into this history and this engrossing and involving movie.Tom Cruise, known to some for fun scenes as in the movie \\'Cocktail,\\' is surprisingly effective in the role of the head of a conspiracy to assassinate Hitler.Tom Cruise starring in the fact-based story of a plot to kill Hitler by Nazi Col. Claus von Stauffenberg sounds like Oscar bait. It isn\\'t. And the sooner you accept it, the more fun you\\'ll have at this satisfying B movie.[Cruise is] distractingly bad in this, the iconography of his celebrity so strongly overshadowing his performance. He\\'s just too powerfully contemporary.Valkyrie is every bit as good as you remember a Tom Cruise movie being, back when you still liked Tom Cruise.I love how Singer plays the whole damn thing like the greatest suspense comic-book story ever told...A tension-packed thriller with a superb cast.Incongruous vocal intonations aren\\'t even the most significant problem plaguing Bryan Singer\\'s film.The movie is streamlined to a fault, a sleek and purring machine interested in process, not people. So when the plan begins falling apart, audience sympathy is fatally missing.VALKYRIE feels like the exciting second part of a miniseries. Part one had all the character bits and drama, though.Refreshing in its lack of pomp and circumstance, a movie that exists to be a movie and nothing bigger.Part suspense thriller about the failed assassination of Hiter, part social protest drama, part star vehicle to reenergize Tom Cruise\\'s troubled career, Valkyrie is engaging but not a good thriller.The film compensates for a lack of verve and action with solid production design and crisp performances from its cast.It\\'s just too bad that a film purporting to espouse female empowerment has to resort to simulated fellatio, public urination, and full-frontal male nudity in order to get its biggest laughs.The sparkling and heartfelt performances from the four leads, plus the sheer boisterousness of the script, makes this a proper laugh-out-loud watch. Girls Trip is raunchy comedy performed to perfection. Watch this movie if you haven\\'t. It\\'s a goddamned national treasure.Girls Trip never feels like it is judging its characters, even at their most outlandish. Instead it repeatedly sends a message that being yourself and living your truth are the way to find happiness. Well, the latest free-wheeling feminine-induced frenzy is presented in the form of filmmaker Malcolm D. Lee\\'s infectiously bouncy and boisterous, soulful sisterhood romp Girls Trip.Despite a generic title and a somewhat formulaic plot, \"Girls Trip\" emerges as the best raunchy comedy since \"Bridesmaids.This is a film in which the cast has so much fun that the audience can\\'t help but have fun as well.Movies such as Girls Trip challenge the confines of the ways women are allowed to be funny-especially Black women.The film is caught in this weird headspace of succeeding at its basest level despite missing the opportunity to excel at its loftiest instead.It\\'s one of those things that probably would have flown under the radar had it not been for Haddish.A refreshingly hilarious raunchy comedy that proves that raunchy comedies can be fun. While predictable, the film makes up for it in all the right ways - this comedy rivals any of its \"bromance\" predecessors.Y\\'all, this movie is one wild ride that must be taken. Everybody needs to see it. Unless you can only enjoy a movie in a completely silent theater... then you may want to try to catch an empty screening.Girls Trip surprised me. It was funny, heartfelt, and had a couple of good messages in it.[Tiffany] Haddish is a genius technician of physical comedy, at once subtle and gigantic. The MVP of Girls Trip, however, is Tiffany Haddish. This should be a huge break-out role for her, and she is so insanely funny that she\\'ll send you into a rabbit hole of YouTube videos from her stand-up routines after the movie.The film is remarkable for its willingness and ability to flaunt its generic premise and go to far stranger, more empowering places than its simple setup might suggest. It\\'s a beautiful tribute to Black womanhood, friendship, and joy in a hilarious package. By far the best comedy of the summer, if not the year, it strikes comedy gold. It\\'s that ridiculously good.It\\'s served well by a likable cast.It will be way too much for some, but does have a heart, ends on a nice note and you certainly won\\'t forget the totally un-embarrassable Haddish in a hurry.Expect plenty of raunchy moments and outrageous drunken situations. The story is a no-brainer too.Girls Trip is as pure as Old School or Bridesmaids, and like both, boasts a breakout star. Haddish steals every scene.It\\'s another Bridesmaids-inspired stumble through the tropes of bad-girl comedy, which includes the mandatory set-piece involving the expulsion of bodily waste...and plenty of blue talk, which is now a regular, if not defining, feature of female comedy. It\\'s able to balance genuine insight with comic punctuation and shameless resolution; they get high and heartfelt.Malcolm D. Lee\\'s exuberant Girls Trip easily outclasses the likes of Bad Moms and Rough Night.Girls Trip\\'s overriding focus is that of friendship -- in its all its raw, bawdy, compromised glory.As silly, crude and debauched as the antics get, the warmth and joy surrounding the four protagonists continually sets the movie apart from its predecessors.IF you missed the girls-gone-bad comedy of Rough Night earlier this year, don\\'t worry. Go and see Girls Trip instead.Girls Trip is better plotted than the similarly themed, Scarlett Johansson-vehicle Rough Night from earlier this year. It has a looseness to its structure that helps the momentum move from one crazy set-piece to the next.However, for all of its ferocious sexual frankness and ear-burningly colourful language, Girls Trip not only knows how to land a big laugh, but also how to sustain and magnify it.Bridesmaids for black people, Girls Trip is high energy raucous fun in praise of girl-power, complete with brash, crude dialogue and sexual connotationsRaunchy comedies aren\\'t everyone\\'s favorite, but for those who like them, Girls Trip will do quite nicely. It may even turn out to be one of summer\\'s few real surprises.The film lives or dies based on the chemistry between the actors, which is just off the charts.Girls Trip is the perfect example of star charisma elevating the material they\\'re working with.These four hilarious ladies prove that, when done right, low brow humor can be an art in itself. [Full review in Spanish]Girls Trip proves that a good laugh can cure anything, including the common case of a familiar script. [Full review in Spanish]The journey is surprisingly fun, owing to cut-above efforts by the principals and a story that, for all its absurdity, essentially spins on traditional themes of sisterhood, kindness and love.We\\'ve got a lot of road to travel before we\\'ll know if the quest was worth it. But I\\'m willing to go along on the journey, so that\\'s something.What could have been a breezy, thrilling stand-alone film is instead a long, sometimes tedious, excursion.An adequate filmmaking exercise that strikes most of the same beats as Lord of the Rings without any of the importance, epic scope or je ne sais quoi.Freeman has been well cast as the young Bilbo, providing a sense of British indignity accompanied by his slightly gormless, gob-smacked facial expressions.It also has one thing that Lord of the Rings never did: A story that is human-scale, even if it\\'s about hobbits and dwarves.At the centre are terrific performances from Freeman and Richard Armitage as the dwarf Thorin, plus all the lush scenery, majesty and magic we\\'ve come to expect from Jackson - strengths that will have us counting the days until part two.Slow start, senstational ending: a decent job. No The Lord Of The Rings, but no The Phantom Menace either.Virtuous, authentic heroes have a way of making more heroes as they journey on, whether across a movie screen or the pages of a beloved book.There is a good deal to be said about Peter Jackson\\'s long-awaited and exceedingly long adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien\\'s The Hobbit, most of it bad.There were extended sequences when my eyes literally could not track the action. Sense of space was demolished. Motion swamped the screen.The \\'LOTR\\' films have become so iconic and undeniably definitive, that it\\'s often anticlimactic in \\'The Hobbit\\' to hear grand characters saying new sentences in new settings. [Peter Jackson\\'s] efforts to filter or self-edit - assuming there were any - remain fruitless.A bloated, entirely unnecessary cash-grab prequel suffering from a fatal case of elephantitis.You may have seen Middle Earth before. But you haven\\'t been IN Middle Earth.Peter Jackson\\'s \\'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\' has made it possible for you to feel like you\\'re surrounded by the astonishing environment created by J.R.R. Tolkien.With the first film pushing three hours, purists will be pleased. Less die-hard audiences will find a lot of meandering set-up - albeit visually gorgeous meandering setup.Remember the joke that The Fellowship of the Ring was just a bunch of people walking around for three hours? In this case, it\\'s actually true.An occasionally entertaining but empty fantasy epic...It rambles over hill and dale and mountain and field and forest and marsh and through cavern and catacomb and grotto and pothole...but will please the Tolkien faithful.It\\'s like we returned to Disneyland to find it looking as magical as ever, but with most of the rides closed. There are worse ways to kill time, sure; it\\'s just that there is, alas, so much time to kill.Unexpected Journey\" runs nearly three hours. That gives Jackson plenty of time to revive its magic [which he does] by triggering our good will toward the \"Rings\" trilogy. He evokes the trilogy\\'s tone and its rhythms.As great as Serkis is, he can\\'t begin to make \\'The Hobbit\\' look anything but short.The odd thing about the saying \"too much of a good thing\" is that it acknowledges the fact that, something, in general, is composed of an overabundance of excellence.The Hobbit may not be as memorable as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it\\'s a mostly faithful adaptation that sticks to the same tones and themes of the source material.It\\'s a journey that any fan of Peter Jackson\\'s \"The Lord of the Rings\" Trilogy should enjoy.Peter Jackson\\'s return to Middle Earth feels familiar and unfulfilling.If Jackson had focused simply on Bilbo\\'s party and their attempts to get a proper homeland for the dwarves, \\'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\' would have been a leaner, more engaging tale.An Unexpected Journey offers an unparalleled visual spectaclea drag-down, mildly diverting entertainmentWhen the dwarves turn up mob-handed, kicking off a night of boisterous revelry, the laboured jests and jollity seem to go on forever. And the combination of dwarves, forced humour and familiar faces off the telly turn the occasion into bad panto.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey had me with the dulcet melancholy of displaced Dwarves, yearning to be home.Slower out of the gates than a three-legged donkey... but it gets better, and fans won\\'t mind this slowburn beginning because, hey, it\\'s Middle Earth.It\\'s the behaviour of the supposedly affable dwarves that makes this particular \\'adventure\\' such a punishing experience.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a story stretched too thin; dragged out by drudging slowness and obvious padding that its handful of thrilling action sequences can\\'t improve. Should more than satisfactorily scratch the itch of those who have waited many long years to see Middle Earth back on screen.A marvel of filmmaking wizardry and engrossing adventure storytelling, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey marks another triumph by director Peter Jackson who once again takes J.R. Tolkien\\'s words and brings them to life with skilful, passionate expertise.THE Hobbit occupies that same awkward spot in popular cinema as the Twilight movies in terms of balancing good cinema against fan-service.Here\\'s hoping Jackson\\'s love affair with technology shifts back to his real strength-good old-fashioned storytelling-and that he has the courage to edit down the film.Disappointing\" isn\\'t the same thing as \"bad.Lacking the interesting characters and intriguing subplots that made the earlier trilogy so engaging, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is too flat, too slow.A vibrant vision but a long slog.Like the sad, bug-eyed Gollum, moviegoers may not have realized how much they missed movies like this onscreen in the past several years. The absolute highlight: the return of Andy Serkis, master of motion-capture performance, as the scary, disturbing, pathetic Gollum.A wild and visually stunning quest through a fantasy world all done with the noble spirit of courage and goodwill.For what it\\'s worth, the first installment of The Hobbit hits all the right notes and delivers what will be expected of itRepetitive and pointless action scenes fill out an already bloated runtime, but not to the level of indulgence that we saw on \\'King Kong\\'.For thousands, the Lord of The Rings trilogy was an emotion-filled spectacle; The Hobbit, by comparison, is all pixels and no pulse.Wax your hyperbole.All in all I think of it as The Hobbit: A Better Than Expected Journey.\\'The Hobbit\\' is another ambitious, gorgeous and faithful trip into JRR\\'s writing - and because of this, it won\\'t win any new fans if you had no patience ten years ago. For those who do, you\\'ll definitely want to go there and back again.An unexpectedly great start to the prequel to \"LOTR\"; Peter Jackson strikes again.My biggest complaint about this latest adventure in Middle-earth is that it is three hours worth of set-up for the next movie.Much as with LotR, the casting is a strength.This first chapter of Peter Jackson\\'s new Tolkien trilogy takes us back to the familiar settings and characters, inflating a simple journey into an epic adventure in the process.Peter Jackson didn\\'t particularly want to direct The Hobbit, and I didn\\'t particularly want to be bored to tears, but there we both were, fulfilling what could only be described as some sort of cinematic murder-suicide pact.Butter spread over too much bread, Bilbo might say.Despite its bloated length and meandering plot, this is still an enjoyable production, at least for fans of Peter Jackson, Middle Earth and J.R.R. Tolkien.It does what so few sequels/prequels do, making you hungry for the next of the series, while still making you appreciate very much what has come before.Peter Jackson seems keenly aware of the differences between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and instead of trying to make one more like the other, he embraces what makes each story unique.Jackson seems to be going through the motions of epic fantasy filmmaking.In his desire to tell this story in the most comprehensive manner possible, Jackson seems to have forgotten one of cinema\\'s most pleasurable tricks: the ability to cut to the chase.This is a Hobbit cobbled together by an obsession with technological ingenuity at the expense of storytelling.Simply, if you\\'re a fan of the way Jackson has delivered Middle-earth to you in the past, then this is more of the same...Visually it is sometimes amazing, but it is a large troll step down from the last trilogy.Entertaining, but just when a good thing becomes too much of a good thing will vary from viewer to viewer.For better or worse this is no longer J.R.R. Tolkien\\'s Hobbit it has become Peter Jackson\\'s Hobbit. Lots of talking, walking and singing. Hard to take the villains seriously when they all sound like high-pitched singing versions of Elmer Fudd. Instead of simply adapting Tolkien\\'s novel, Jackson has opted to use the story as a jumping off point for a convoluted prequel that threatens to do for Middle Earth what George Lucas\\'s Star Wars prequels did for a galaxy far, far away.This is hobbit cordial, one part juice to nine parts water.I prefer my movies to be more entertainment than ordeal.\\'Well, that was the longest video game trailer I have ever seen. No, seriously, are you going to show the real film now?\\'It frequently seems as though Jackson was less interested in making The Hobbit than in remaking his own fabulously successful Lord of the Rings series.Not all the scenes are necessary, and a great deal of the movie is set-up, with Jackson reveling in his own return to Middle Earth. But it\\'s an enjoyable experience.Happily, despite all the technical details, \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" is exciting, tantalizing and satisfying.While this film is way too long and might be more for Tolkien devotees than mainstream audiences, after a slow start it turns into a rousing adventure with plenty of visual flair and top-notch action sequences.Precisely what an adventure epic should be: huge, long, and lots of fun.Two thirds is so packed with charming characters, stellar visuals and sense of adventure, it makes that other third come across as much more of a failure than it really is.A few extemporaneous Lord of the Rings elements distract from The Hobbit storyline but Jackson has presented a captivating and exciting return to Middle-earth.This first installment should draw a large audience; getting it back for rounds two and three will be more difficult.There are so few directors who can convincingly create a fantasy world that I applaud Jackson for continuing to make Middle Earth a travel destination we still love to visit -- even if the journey is becoming less direct.Despite some minor missteps, watching it feels like welcoming an old friend into your home. He may ramble a bit and slightly overstay his welcome, but hanging out with him reminds you of why you\\'re friends in the first place.A promising start. Are the creatures amazingly rendered? Yes. Have we seen their lifelike equal onscreen before? No.My first thought in watching The Hobbit was: Do we really need this movie? It was my last thought, too.To its own narrative detriment, \"The Hobbit\" works hard to lay the framework for what will follow. Certainly that\\'s one way to set out on a trilogy, but it\\'s surely not the best.Nearly three hours, and the story has progressed only slightly. Nothing is short and sweet here, not even the identities. It\\'s always Thorin, son of Theraflu, son of Thong, etc.Tolkien tale isn\\'t as great as LOTR, but better for tweens.Jackson\\'s risky creative choices have drained Bilbo Baggins\\' adventure of its magic.It\\'s all fight scenes, and the fight scenes have no arc. You just sit there waiting for some inevitable deus ex machina to save the day whenever Peter Jackson feels like it. The characters have no agency. It\\'s like watching a kid play with his GI Joes.By no means a disaster, The Hobbit mixes thrills with disappointmentsTolkein geeks rejoiceFantasy fans hungry for a second breakfast of Tolkien-fueled fare can get their fill with this visually sumptuous feast.Peter Jackson catches a nasty case of George Lucas-itis with his latest Middle earth saga.There\\'s no denying the majesty in Peter Jackson\\'s visuals but he\\'s taken a relatively slim children\\'s book and stretched it beyond the limits.Sad to say, \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" is a pale shadow trying to reach the sun on the strength of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.In his attempt to produce a definitive, enhanced-strength version of the text, Jackson has stripped away much of the fun, a great deal of the energy and most of the humour.What it all comes down to is that if you in any way, shape or form enjoyed the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies then you must see \"The Hobbit.\" Many happy returns.Yet another battle-filled and self-indulgent film by Peter Jackson.With each successive set-piece, the movie grows more and more rousing.A minor flaw or two but assuming you don\\'t spend all of your days barefoot like a Hobbit, the movie will knock your socks off. The reason it\\'s so hard to immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth again isn\\'t HOW Peter Jackson filmed \"The Hobbit.\" It\\'s WHAT he filmed. A hugely enjoyable set-up for what looks set to be another thrilling trilogy.Jackson has delivered plenty more of the big setpieces that fans loved in the trilogy, albeit at the cost of making The Hobbit far more imperial and epic than it needs to be.Jackson has come back to Middle Earth to compose his most masturbatory effort yet.This has to go down as the most disappointing film of the year.It would be wrong to ignore the technical achievement that Jackson has pulled off yet again. But when said and done, \"The Hobbit\" feels more like a cinematic encyclopedia of Tolkein\\'s mythical world rather than a trip to the movies.THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is a visual feast with whimsy and charm.The repeated iterations of fight, flight and respite here get wearing. Especially perhaps because, with Jackson\\'s fetish for detail, they take more time to watch on screen than to read about.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" has finally arrived, not on wings of gossamer fancy but with a hairy-footed thud.Hems and haws with only an occasional cinematic punch, making it a good, but very expected journey. Not what you might have been expecting, or hoping for.A well-made spectacle that makes up for overall lacking story and character development with one incredible action scene after the next.Jackson himself seems to miss the forest of the story for the literal trees.Moments of brilliance and moments of boredomThose expecting THE HOBBIT to be on the same level as LORD OF THE RINGS are only setting themselves up for disappointment. But if you just go in expecting a fun adventure, you should be able to enjoy it. Just DON\\'T see it in the higher frame rate.If this were Green Eggs and Ham, the film would stop at approximately the point at which you would not eat them with a fox.One possibility is that the main thing to recommend the film is nostalgia. But so be it.Gets off to a decent start for this next trilogy, but it\\'s not the epic, genre-redefining event of the one that preceded it.The overgenerous running time is somewhat to the film\\'s advantage, but there are warning signs that Jackson might be stretching the tale to its limit.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a lot like that beat up car you have sitting in the driveway. It doesn\\'t always accelerate when it should, but once it gets going it\\'s more reliable than anything.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ... is clumsy where Tolkien\\'s book is streamlined -- filling in the gaps where the novel is vague...Just because you can do three movies doesn\\'t mean you need to do three movies.With approximately six more hours to go, it\\'s tough not to shudder at the sheer lengths director Peter Jackson is about to go to stretch this story into paper-thin taffy.If The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is any indicator of things to come, this trilogy could be every bit as wondrous and exciting as the one that preceded it.An overlong adventure enlivened by wonders.Guess what is unexpected about this journey? Nothing, as there isn\\'t one surprise in watching this continuation of the cinematic telling of J.R.R. Tolkien\\'s Middle Earth tales.An Unexpected Journey is a major comedown, a muddle-headed and cumbersome piece of filmmaking that betrays Jackson\\'s mercenary motives -- Tolkien\\'s book, too.If you loved the earlier films, these are moments you will hold on to, but they\\'re very few, and they\\'re not enough.Once again, Jackson proves adept at capturing the tone and feel of Middle Earth, and the film takes us along familiar trails to meet some of our old friends.I trust Jackson\\'s instincts with Tolkien\\'s work. It\\'s his editorial indifference that could pose a greater threat to The Hobbit than any attack from Smaug.Part One of director Peter Jackson\\'s planned film trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkien\\'s The Hobbit forces audiences to run an obstacle course before the fun kicks in.Between its lighter tone and a decade\\'s worth of improvements in digital film techniques, there should be enough of a novelty factor to delight most fans.The tone of Jackson\\'s latest is, appropriately, much more jovial than that of Rings, which unfolds in an era far more stricken with despair.I was impressed with how much of the story\\'s good humor Jackson and Co. manage to weave into the spectacle. It\\'s there in the close shave with a gang of hungry trolls, and it really lifts off once Andy Serkis\\' uncanny Gollum enters the picture.Those early scenes in the Shire and the story of the loss of the dwarf kingdom establish character and purpose and give reason to hope and care that, like a talented sports team with a losing record, things can get only better.A major disappointment that is about as difficult to swallow as the Denny\\'s meals that are among the avalanche of commercial tie-ins that have accompanied its release. Fun, though more than a little trying.Time will tell if this is a new Peter Jackson cash cow or just a bridge too far.The film is frequently gorgeous, technologically adventurous and eventually thrilling.Tolkien\\'s inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle.Even at their eye-filling best, these sequences generate more spectacle than suspense.Once the adventure is finally underway, and Martin Freeman\\'s meek hero starts to come into his own, Jackson digs in and delivers an appropriately epic companion piece to his earlier trilogy.Once it gets going, it\\'s actually quite fun.This movie is about drawing things out as much as possible to make a snack-size story feel like a meal.The last hour of this movie is pretty much nonstop, and it\\'s a gas.Little about the storytelling suggests a beating heart beneath the visuals; once the journey has begun, the characters find themselves in life-threatening danger with stupefying regularity.Jackson\\'s biggest failing with the first installment of The Hobbit is that he crowds out a great story with such minor plot developments that carry no immediate importance to the movie or characters.Seeing The Hobbit is like going to a timeshare presentation. First you have to sit through the boring stuff before you can take advantage of the spectacular benefits.Jackson imposes a sense of grandeur but mostly loses Tolkien\\'s sense of fun.This is not about a reluctant hero drawing courage from some deep personal well. It\\'s not about dread and danger. It\\'s about visual effects.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" is not the worst film of the year, but it may be the most disappointing.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey looks like the start of another blockbuster trilogy.I\\'m afraid that whoever it was in the New York Film Critics Circle who voted for \"The Hobbit\" as best animated film had a point. And so did the people who suspected that this whole thing was a bad idea.Watching The Hobbit was an unexpected endurance test. Younger children will not last the pace, but plucky ten year olds with a couple of well timed toilet breaks will lap this up. Rather than an epic continuation of Jackson\\'s Middle-earth obsession, the film seems more like the work of a man driving around a multilevel parking garage without being able to find the exit.A bloated, dull mess of a film that meanders when it should move and stumbles when it should run.Get ready for a more heated debate than any election season. Is Peter Jackson\\'s ambitious, overblown adaptation worth it, or is it a flagrant attempt to create a cash cow out of a children\\'s book? The answer is yes.If you\\'re going to a see a nearly three-hour movie based on a fraction of a popular book, make it \"Lincoln\" As fun as it is to watch, this isn\\'t Tolkien\\'s Hobbit. The story of a peaceable traveler who knew the virtue of restraint is lost to the vision of filmmakers who have none.The unhappy truth [is] that this return visit to Middle Earth is a bloated letdown.The film is worthy of both your attention and of the Tolkien legendarium in which Jackson, his actors and his Weta Workshop technical crew are so firmly situated.At nearly three hours long, \"An Unexpected Journey\" has moments when the caravan seems both overstuffed and out of balance, but it\\'s such a scenic trip that only a stubborn homebody could complain....for the faithful. For everyone else, it will probably prove the same as any long journey, periods of discovery and excitement countered with long stretches of boredom.It is great to once more be whisked back to Tolkien\\'s extraordinarily vivid world, but Jackson\\'s overstuffed film proves that it is possible to get too much of a good thing. To gaze upon the film, like Frodo staring into that prophetic magic orb, is to be shaken by a dark vision of cinema\\'s future.Is it crunchable? Is it scrumptious? The best awful-looking film I have ever seen.As entertaining as watching the last bits of ketchup drip out of the bottle.Bloated...overlong. Even Shakespeare needs editing.Features terrific performances, stunning action sequences and some state-of-the-art special effects, but it\\'s also far too long ...I\\'m here to vouch for Jackson, except for the length.Almost all highlights and bombast, with little if any room for subtlety or poetry.When, in Jackson\\'s film, someone describes a character\\'s \"love of gold\" as having become \"too fierce,\" you wonder if the warning might apply to \"The Hobbit\" in other ways.At its best, it recaptures the Rings movies\\' breadth, detail, and staggering sense of beauty.Often entertaining, especially for those fans who loved The Lord of the Rings and have been waiting years to see more of Tolkien\\'s Middle-earth onscreen.Peter Jackson definitely knows what he\\'s doing. He just didn\\'t do it this time.Peter Jackson has formally moved away from the artistic act of directing, and into the business of creating synthetic movie \"product.\" Does An Unexpected Journey do a satisfactory job bringing audiences back to Middle Earth? The answer is \\'yes\\' - if not as resolutely as I may have hoped - and the film is absolutely worth seeing for this quality alone[The] elements are in place again, but the story feels less substantial than the Lord of the Rings tales.Solid and acceptable instead of soaring and exceptional, [and] unnecessarily hampered in its quest to reach the magical heights of the trilogy.It all just takes so long.Regardless of the frames, dimensions, or goggles used to conjure it, \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" is an incredible ride and a triumphant return to Middle Earth.Packed with crescendos and crap-outs, Peter Jackson\\'s mega-bloated beginning to Bilbo Baggins\\' pilgrimage across Middle-earth to Lonely Mountain both awes and bores.Decent enough fantasy adventure, but it doesn\\'t especially feel like Tolkien.The Hobbit\" becomes what it was originally meant to be - not a cut-from-the-same-cloth prequel, but its own, individual thing.[A] dazzling, busy, fundamentally tedious movie ...It\\'s a shame to see Peter Jackson treading water when there are so many new cinematic horizons worth exploring.I found that it provided a pretty convincingly immersive experience, and I look forward to the technology\\'s evolution/refinement. Which I guess also means I look forward to the next two installments of the trilogy.In a bit of irony, Bilbo Baggins says at the end of the movie: \"I do believe the worst is behind us.\" We can only hope so.The board is set, the pieces are moving and we\\'re set up nicely for Jackson to tighten the noose with the love of second-act grit he displayed in The Two Towers.The more dark it becomes, the more \\'The Hobbit\\' becomes compelling as a story, and finds a fitting tone.The Hobbit\" is an impressive first chapter.Even though this installment is mostly a prelude, Jackson\\'s eccentric mixture of low humor, earnest foreboding and digitally processed pageantry is consistently engaging and immersive.Piles on enough eye candy and action sequences to please fans, plus more humor than the three \"Rings\" films - even if it only occasionally achieves the trio\\'s grandeur.If Peter Jackson couldn\\'t tell this slight story in a single film there\\'s no hope the other two in this prequel series will be any less bloated.It\\'s a promising start...but where it\\'s going to in the two remaining movies is anybody\\'s guess.The Hobbit may be a different story to The Lord Of The Rings ... but there is really nothing all that unexpected about this journey.I found myself concentrating more on the strange look of the film and less on the film itself.While fans of J.R.R. Tolkien\\'s novels and The Lord of the Rings movies will find plenty to enjoy and marvel over, non-believers may find themselves getting bored and bemused by the unnecessarily drawn-out story.Where the format comes into its own is in intense, action-packed territory. An Unexpected Journey\\'s battle sequences are especially striking.Where the format comes into its own is in intense, action-packed territory. An Unexpected Journey\\'s battle sequences are especially striking.An Unexpected Journey is a bit ropey, excessive and padded in places, sure, but if that\\'s the worst and the best is yet to come, then this could end up being another great trilogy.What\\'s all this add up to? Not terribly much.It\\'s not as good as I hoped, but it\\'s also a lot better than I feared.Thankfully, Jackson\\'s flair for action sequences and bold and complex production design hasn\\'t deserted him.Viewers have come to expect visceral combat between characters who feel tangible in their appearance and reactions, but there\\'s none of that here.On balance, honor has been done to Tolkien, not least in the famous riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum, and some of the exploits to come will surely lighten the load.An Unexpected Journey is a competent, entertaining effort but it neither enthralls nor amazes in the way its predecessors did.[M]ore than a bit like slogging through overly completist volumes of fan fiction, and that is going to bore more casual moviegoers, and also some serious fans...The Hobbit plays younger and lighter than Fellowship and its follow-ups, but does right by the faithful and has a strength in Martin Freeman\\'s Bilbo that may yet see this trilogy measure up to the last one. There is treasure here.The Lord of the Rings trilogy [has] been replaced by something that resembles tatty summer-stock theater.Peter Jackson returns to the Middle Earth he rendered so faithfully in Lord of the Rings, and it\\'s never looked so glorious.The real triumph of The Hobbit is that Peter Jackson leaves you wanting more.Jackson has made The Hobbit with brio and fun, and Martin Freeman is just right as Bilbo Baggins: he plays it with understatement and charm.As a lover of cinema, Jackson\\'s film bored me rigid; as a lover of Tolkien, it broke my heart.Emotionally rewarding, imaginatively detailed and made with a genuine sense of joy, the first Hobbit chapter succeeds despite its structural and formatting mis-steps.Peter Jackson triumphantly returns to Middle Earth with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. A folksy, beguiling adventure, we get to enjoy the splendor of the story and fantastic settings in a more whimsical experience.Grandiose and visually spectacular, although the visual effects overwhelm the narrative.An Unexpected Journey has so many pay-offs that most are likely to re-engage with the saga. Once these dwarves, accompanied by Bilbo and Gandalf, hit the road, the film takes off and doesn\\'t come down until the credits roll. Even once Bilbo and company take to the hobbit highway, the pacing is leisurely verging on lethargic ...The movie lacks majesty. Grand in parts, the movie is too often grandiose or grandiloquent; and the running time is indefensible.The Lord of the Rings trilogy behind him, Peter Jackson has begun yet another, this time adapting the Tolkien epic, The Hobbit. The first chapter of Jackson\\'s new trilogy is decent, if not enirely satisfying, bound to suffer from inevitable comparisons with the superior, Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings.Peter Jackson\\'s return to swords, sorcery and beards deserving of their own postcodes is fantasy how it ought to be.This film is pure excess that\\'s almost definitely motivated by studio greed, but it\\'s light entertainment that will please fans, and Andy Serkis damn-near runs away with the film during his exemplary third-act appearance as Gollum.Tolkien\\'s brisk story of intrepid little hobbit Bilbo Baggins is drawn out and diluted by dispensable trimmings better left for DVD extras.Fulfilling just a fraction of J.R.R. Tolkien\\'s \"There and Back Again\" subtitle, The Hobbit alternately rewards and abuses auds\\' appetite for all things Middle-earth.Where Jackson might occasionally misstep tonally, he takes the reigns from the episodic original and runs with generally fantastic results through several narrative additions, all of which give the characters more agency in their own affairs.While Jackson hasn\\'t delivered a hit on par with his \"Lord of the Rings\" movies, \"The Hobbit\" proves he can still do justice to the tricky blend of fantasy and action that made the earlier entries such enjoyable works of popular entertainment.There are elements in this new film that are as spectacular as much of the Rings trilogy was, but there is much that is flat-footed and tedious as well, especially in the early going.Setting aside technological considerations, The Hobbit is nothing short of a joyous homecoming.An Unexpected Journey may as well be The Phantom Menace and God help us all if the next two movies aren\\'t better than this one.It\\'s not as bad as you feared, but not as good as you hoped. Peter Jackson\\'s fourth trip to Middle-earth can\\'t quite recapture the greatness, emotional impact or charm of the LOTR films, but there\\'s still much to enjoy about The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.For now, \\'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\' is a good start, but with the expectations resting on the film, is good going to be good enough? A fresh, free-spirited form of fantasy, Jackson\\'s latest provides a younger generation with a stepping stone to his later films while serving the adult\\'s who want more. Unless your dreams are populated by denizens of Middle Earth, endless footage of them simply talking or walking is a lot less spectacular than Peter Jackson thinks it is.A briskly engaging adventure shrouded in superfluous detail, though also, yes, admittedly, technical virtuosity, it\\'s an accomplished if unexciting first chapter in the preamble to his Oscar-winning film series.For its occasional moments of excess and unhurried pace, An Unexpected Journey is proof that Jackson still has a knack for stories in this world.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is more fun than The Fellowship of the Ring, no doubt about it.Tolkien could invent names and languages, but he couldn\\'t create a plot at gunpoint. This film stands ably on its own, offering up generous piles of large scale fantasy underscored by genuine emotional heft and boundary-pushing visuals.The movie itself is a lot of fun. And if you can separate yourself from the visual distraction, you\\'ll find plenty to enjoy.Vital as they are, Gollum and Bilbo can only do so much to keep us enchanted. Is Jackson able to sustain the magic in two more installments? I peer into Tolkien\\'s Misty Mountains and embrace the journey.was mostly shocked by Vince Vaughan, who showed me for the first time that he wasn\\'t the long-delayed immature frat boy he so often plays, but actually an imperfect hilarious, yet often silly, character who\\'s main flaw is his selfishness.The Break-Up is a funny and light comedy, but it tries to be something a bit more without being something a bit more, hampered by shoddy characterization, ending up a bit empty.The two stars remain painfully wrong for each otherIs anxious to be a modern \"Annie Hall,\" but really it is just a tedious, glum, and god awful affair.The Break-Up\" comes with a slap and a kiss that\\'s at once bracing and pleasing.A word of caution to anyone heading off to see The Break-Up with the assumption that it is a romantic comedy: this is not a comedy movie with a serious side -- it is a serious movie with a comedic side.Stereotypes across the board, puerile one-upmanship games, and an utter failure to explain why, indeed, these two even were together.High-aimed intentions are thrown askew by the reliance on inconsistent laughs seemingly meant to break the otherwise overriding tension.Right up there with the best of the revenge genre, and earns praise from this critic for its sophisticated brand of humor which kept me in stitches from start to finish.Not even the tacked-on ending, hinting at some future sparks between Brooke and Gary, can lighten the sturm und drang in this break-up....\"The Break Up\" may go down with \"Fatal Attraction\" as the worst \"date\" movie of all time.full review in GreekThere\\'s nothing broken about The Break-Up, which turns rom-com conventions on their side in free-wheeling fashion, and in doing so colorfully, wittily celebrates what it is about men and women that both attract one another and drives us crazy.A romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor particularly funny.A little broken, but worth the viewing.[I]t combines a naked desire to please the audience with a try-anything approach of the kind that made Wedding Crashers such a desperate stab at entertainment.It\\'s still very much a quick and painless Hollywood production, what slight genius there is in its premise dulled by the sheen of the high production values and its prettier-than-pretty cast.It\\'s never less than entertaining and the chemistry between our two leads, whatever their personal circumstances, really holds things together.This is that branch of the romantic comedy known as \\'a relationship movie\\', but generally short on witty lines and amusing incidents.The Break-Up doesn\\'t turn the rom-com on its head, but with its focus on the darker side of love manages to gently tip it on its side.Sharp dialogue and detailed observations make it a good deal funnier than you might expect.While consistently funny, The Break-Up deals in bitterness and revenge, sometimes in ways that cut closer to the bone than most fluffy romantic comedies.Think less Wedding Crashers and more War of the Roses minus the oddly romantic violence.Breaking up may be hard to do. And it\\'s not so easy to watch, either.Like the story of many broken down relationships: despite the initial attraction, you\\'re left feeling cheated.This \"\\'Break-Up\" is, unfortunately, hard to do.Star power is an interesting thing, especially when it goes wrong.Delivers something worthwhile to those open-minded enough to be able to settle with wild shifts between average satire and grounded pathosIt\\'s not a good sign when a movie is called The Break-Up and you can\\'t wait for the couple to split so they\\'ll get some relief from one another, and give the audience some relief from them.One seemingly terminal problem with the casting of Ms. Aniston and Mr. Vaughn is that neither of their careers has featured characters who excelled at one-to-one relationships with the opposite sex.It fails because it neglects to create characters we care about.Nil chemistry. How can Vaughn and Aniston be dating? They don\\'t even like each other. Every bit as unpleasant as it sounds. But the film\\'s intentions are to examine a separation, and the story achieves its set goals.An extended sit-com played for laughs, with little to redeem itself. The two central characters are not the only ones who wish things had been different. I, for one, would have liked to laugh. Or cry. Or at least be entertained. Oh, did you want to see a Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy? Life isn\\'t always about Hollywood expectations; let\\'s cut Jennifer some slack and enjoy her doing good work.In an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality, The Break-Up offers a refreshing flipside.The behavior of the two main charactres exists solely to be \"cute,\" while giving us no reason to believe these two people should be together in the first place.It\\'s frustrating, but it\\'s real.Tensions predictably escalate and we\\'re forced to spend the rest of the movie pretending like we care if these two annoying slices of Wonder Bread end up together.This is a tragedy with laughs, not a comedy.... Comes apart at the seams, the victim of irreconcilable differences between Vaughn\\'s schtick and the flimsy script.You end up hoping the serial killer from See No Evil will wander over from a neighboring auditorium and pluck out their eyes just to make it stop.... at least it ends on a more positive note than Closer...With nothing genuine invested in either character, we can focus fully on how bland and churlish they are.Go in expecting a romantic comedy, and you\\'ll be disappointed; go in expecting a grueling dissection of a relationship that should never have started, and you might find it interesting.I\\'m not sure what it was trying to deliver, and I don\\'t think director Peyton Reed knows either.Vaughn, who has fooled Hollywood into thinking he\\'s a real actor, has two basic styles: motor-riff quickly through dialogue or stand still and imitate a brick. The only really nice thing about the story is that it doesn\\'t opt for a Hollywood happy ending.Vaughn is a guy\\'s-guy kind of actor -- his characters are more comfortable shooting pool or knocking back beers than getting romantic on the couch -- so it\\'s no surprise that the chemistry he generates is with Favreau rather than Aniston.The most interesting so far of this summer\\'s blockbuster disappointments, the film\\'s willingness to buck audience expectations and at least try for something tougher makes it an admirable failure. This is a deeply conservative movie, not conservative in a political way but conservative in a Ward-and-June-Cleaver kind of way...Vince Vaughn kills me. Jennifer Aniston, I think, is underrated as a film actress.\\'The Break-Up\\' sticks to its guns -- interpret the title literally -- and is refreshingly better for it.amusing at times, but neither the story nor the lead actors give us enough to care or laugh about.\\'The Break-Up\\' breaks down in the endThe emotional thread is unpleasant from beginning to end with the occasional comical quip sporadically thrown in.A misguided comedy that relies on obnoxious characters and mean, abrasive behavior.One of the things that is most intriguing about The Break-Up is how it shows the cruelty that people can inflict upon one another as soon as love fades.The whole movie is a game of one-upsmanship, as each one tries to make the other more miserable. It gets increasingly ugly and painful. Then it ends.At least one draft short of brilliance....[but] more palatable than the typical romantic comedy, thanks in large part to Vaughn\\'s engaging duets with the ensemble.What starts out as a Doris Day-Rock Hudson romantic comedy morphs into \\'Who\\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf.\\'When, oh when, will the scorching on-screen chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau finally be consummated?A rare category of date movie: We wish it played more like other date movies.Is The Break-Up worth your time? Let\\'s put it this way: Whenever Vaughn is onscreen, it is. When he\\'s not, it ain\\'t.There\\'s something admirably perverse about The Break-Up, a movie that wants to jolt the tired romantic comedy genre by getting rid of the romance.Their ongoing one-upmanship is awkward, juvenile, and not especially funny, yet underscored by so much honest pain you understand -- if not condone -- Gary and Brooke\\'s desperate actions.In The Break-Up, men are slobs, women are passive-aggressive, and viewers opposed to broad brush strokes for either gender are sorely out of luck.The movie is barely stenciled as a story. The romance never gains enough focus or momentum to make its crisis even comically involving.The movie offers nothing funny, just a series of sour situations.A love-it-or-hate-it mainstream romantic comedy in that makes a frill-free connection with its audience, whether that audience wants it or not. There\\'s nothing wrong with something that delivers belly laughs before striking at gut level.There\\'s no reason not to see The Break-Up, but there\\'s also no reason, assuming the date is going well, not to skip it and order dessert.Sour and unsavory, rather than a black comedy, it\\'s a bleak comedy.It\\'s the most interesting spin on domestic strife since Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were hurling dishes at each other in The War of the Roses.What ultimately makes The Break-Up so good and refreshing is its firm denial of the \"chick flick\" stamp of approval.Brooke and Gary articulate their discontent with considerable precision and occasional verve. It\\'s that they haven\\'t figured out a way to make emotional torment funny, which is the tall order inherent in anti-romantic comedy.In short, The Break-Up is too accurate to be light-hearted, too light and flippant to be really romantic.Here\\'s a movie that\\'s not worth getting all broken up about. Or for that matter, going broke to see.A romantic comedy that\\'s short on both romance and comedy.The fun parts of this movie actually occur when the two leads are not with each other but in their respective corners preparing for the next round.What looks like a raucous frat-boy comedy is really a surprisingly canny depiction of a stagnant relationship.With a movie unwilling to go for the jugular, it\\'s more like the dismal The Story of Us than The War of the Roses.I don\\'t know if The Break-Up qualifies as a date movie. But it will serve as a cautionary tale for couples falling in love.Listening to people bicker for almost two hours wears thin, especially when the comedy is never quite so funny as you had hoped it would be.It\\'s the movie\\'s wobbly tone and its betrayal of its characters in the name of niceness that dooms The Break-Up into being a film that will satisfy no one -- not even the bottom-line thinkers.It\\'s hamhandedly squeezed through the Hollywood rom-com template, resulting in a movie as moribund as the relationship it portrays.For all that goes wrong with The Break-Up, the most compelling question it raises has to do with the state of the romantic comedy during a cynical, prepackaged, reality-tv moment.It might not be the frosted lemon tart that\\'s been advertised for months, but it is solid, satisfying fare -- flecked with humor, grounded in pain.The Break-Up goes badly wrong. Although possessed of a laudable desire not to be yet another run-of-the-mill, wacky-impediment -- damned if the picture can figure out how to be an anti-romance comedy.As an off-beat anatomy of a troubled couple, the film almost succeeds. As summer movie fun well, it\\'s not.If you really feel the need to be bullied and insulted, just call up your HMO provider or reserve a table at an expensive restaurant.This plot provides plenty of material, but director Peyton Reed and first-time screenwriters Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender pack the film with characters and subplots that don\\'t really go anywhere.It doesn\\'t work as a revealing look at relationships or as a consistently funny comedy about the war between the sexes.A serviceable bit of relationship fluff buoyed by a couple of well-tuned performances from Aniston and Vaughn.Like so many contemporary movies, The Break-Up doesn\\'t know when to call it quits, and the film finally expires after several false endings.The Break-Up is a pleasant surprise to the open-minded.Director Peyton Reed really does seem to be trying to probe for something more worthy, to find some insight into modern-day relationships, but it simply isn\\'t there.The Break-Up mostly just lies there -- alternately adoring and condemning its characters for their puppyish refusal to grow up.This is a very watchable film...not your standard rom-com garbage.Akin to an unhealthy relationship, this self-described \\'anti-romantic comedy\\' begins hot and heavy before buckling beneath the weight of pointless conflicts and ridiculous game-playing.The comedy, for lack of a better description, is not funny. It is churlish, childish and petulant.The Break-Up is more like Annie Hall told with Chicago attitude and work ethic.It\\'s not a relationship we become invested in, because all we see of it... are still photos over the opening credits.There\\'s something deviantly infectious about the twisted joy of revenge.Aniston has always done some of her best acting in reaction shots, and Vaughn is a gold mine to react against. Look, I\\'m not talking about a masterpiece here. What I am talking about is a good film trying desperately to break out of the romantic comedy box and, for the most part, doing so.While the situations are real and the dialogue is authentic, \"The Break-Up\" is mundane and trite.It\\'s at least trying to stay anchored in the real world, where cute couples don\\'t always make up and walk hand-in-hand into the sunset.Vaughn and Aniston have remarkable chemistry, and both do a masterful job expressing the realities of such a sad and painful experience.It genuinely tugs at our heartstrings as we witness two people in the agonizing throes of a crumbling relationship....there\\'s nothing terribly compelling about watching likable stars argue for close to two hours.In spite of some laughs, and winning performances from Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, The Break-Up is more likely to make audiences squirm than cheer.The Break-Up is so depressing, painful and awful to watch that I felt like I had just been through a bitter divorce myself.Nobody likes a fixed fight, except the backroom boys making the deal. Which is why The Break-Up may have its share of laughs, but isn\\'t much fun.The surprising thing about it is not how funny it is, as that\\'s to be expected, but how serious it is. Also surprising: It works.The lack of climax and the ambiguous resolution cut closer to the bone than most summer fare, but the screenplay, by two writers making their feature debut, stays formulaic enough to never really draw blood.It\\'s full of pain and quirky characters standing at oblique angles to one another, and while it doesn\\'t add up it held me throughout.Vince Vaughn overreacting to Pictionary will certainly be on his highlight reel at the next awards show... The greatest comedy is found in the deepest truths, and when the truth hurts, the experience can touch the full spectrum of emotion.Eventually you\\'re just rooting for Gary and Brooke to get the whole ordeal over with, as much for the audience\\'s sake as for their own.The Break-Up is ultimately a big budget heart-heavy indy film, and not a slapstick broad comedy as the ads would have you think...Break-Up could be viewed as the ultimate romantic comedy; the rare picture that makes one thank heaven for all the good relationships they\\'ve managed to luck into.I think it\\'s courageous -- it\\'s something we\\'re not used to seeing from this category of movies these days. A stark honesty is presented here.Don\\'t expect to crack up at The Break-Up.Just because performers click romantically off-screen doesn\\'t mean you need to pay good money to watch them in movies that are less interesting than the stories they inspire in supermarket tabloids.He likes Social Distortion, she likes Alanis Morrissette. And quite frankly, either \"Ball and Chain\" or \"Isn\\'t it Ironic\" are both better takes on the modern relationship.A decaffeinated and imbalanced War of the Roses where the occasional funny riff from Vaughn attempts to distract us from material which is far more familiar than he believes.The Break-Up is much like a real relationship as it starts off all hilarious and fun, but you are tearing your hair out by the end.you\\'ll be wishing they\\'d just call it quitsThe Break-Up can\\'t work because it denies its protagonist his humanity, and us the pleasure of watching human characters do at least vaguely human things.A brilliantly conceived romantic comedy reversal that turns the genre on its head.If you value your time and your relationship, don\\'t see this on a date.The filmmakers have wildly miscalculated the chemistry these real-life lovers generate on film.The Break-Up doesn\\'t know whether it wants to be a facile, enjoyable date movie or an unnerving examination of the dark, pockmarked underbelly of everything we expect out of romantic relationships....a gloomy mishmash of ideas that never comes together and is hardly ever fun to watch.An eye for the devil in the details gives the story its heart -- a broken heart, but that\\'s better than none at all.The Break-Up is a refreshingly different romantic comedy, one that doesn\\'t so much rely on gimmicks as on digging around for genuine feelings.Director Peyton Reed doesn\\'t quite bring the sharpness, litheness and attention to detail he brought to Bring It On and Down With Love to The Break-Up, which is nonetheless alternately funny and painful.[not] a bad film, merely a mismarketed one...a sad little Valentine from Mars to VenusThe summer\\'s biggest disappointment - though hardly the worst movie - so far. If, as the ads would lead you to believe, you go to see The Break-Up expecting a romantic comedy, you will be severely disappointed. If you go to it expecting a good movie, you will also be severely disappointed.Peyton Reed\\'s The Break-Up proves there is nothing particularly funny or charming about two people splitting up, even if the couple is played by Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston.As anticlimactic as an actual breakup, without any of the passion, the anger or the glimmers of hope that come from gradually parting with someone you love.Terrific supporting cast with eccentric characters lifts this comedy above the norm; Vaughn\\'s rapid fire delivery of witty stream-of-consciousness dialogue really scores.For all of its comedic nosedives, the film is frank and uncompromising as a study of the final weeks of a relationship.A sporadically funny comedy about a crisis in the relationship of a smiley couple who seem to think that life should be an endless run of happy days.Take the funny away from Vaughn, and you\\'ve got Return to Paradise, and nobody wants to see that.She\\'s identified almost entirely by her haircut at the end--just as the actress who plays her has been for much of her career.It\\'s a checklist of summer-movie elements arranged with enough care to suggest that it should add up to more than a pleasant diversion.A wishy-washy little relationship comedy that\\'s nowhere near as nasty as it evidently wants to be.The Break-Up is too badly fractured to be deemed repairable.The Break-Up is like an uncomfortable party that you can\\'t wait to leave.The movie\\'s crazy insistence on going its own way shows flashes of genius.Until a cop-out ending, this is War of the Roses territory, where laughs take no prisoners.Watching these likable actors flounder around as they try to save a picture that\\'s not worth saving is, well, depressing.What\\'s strange about The Break-Up is that, despite the alleged deep love between Gary and Brooke, you never get the sense that much is at stake.The Break-Up fails to freshen the stale news that women are from Venus and men are from Mars.To call it erratic would be to imply there was a course it went off, but the film\\'s intentions are impossible to fathom. It\\'s a romantic comedy in which the romance comes stillborn and in which the comedy barely exists.You have no desire to see them either get back together or murder one another - you just want them to leave each other alone. And that\\'s not exactly compelling cinema.As Neil Sedaka famously observed, breaking up is hard to do, but it proves even harder to watch in this shrill, sour comedy....the film still clicked for me because it was set around a realistic situation to which many people can relate and was peppered with laughs and even some genuine emotion.Not a typical, formulaic, feel-good romantic-comedy...Plays a bit like Best Friends for a younger generation.When they break up, which happens pretty early in this self-professed \\'anti-romantic comedy,\\' it doesn\\'t seem tragic. It just makes sense.The Break-Up is being marketed as an \\'unconventional romantic comedy,\\' but the only thing unconventional about it is that it\\'s not romantic and it\\'s not a comedy.It\\'s like watching the \\'we were on a break\\' episode of Friends stretched to feature length...This one, in every sense, is fake.A sometimes entertaining film, it just never gels.A borderline-schizophrenic tone regularly undercuts both the nasty, biting humor and weepy sentimentality.Their trademark good guy and girl blow their mutual affability in a dull show of falling apart.Ill-conceived virtually from the opening frame as a self-described \\'anti-romantic comedy.\\'After a promisingly quirky start, Break-Up suffers a major breakdown from which it never recovers.nannannannannannannanUnmemorable, unfunny and unoriginal.Save for its dalliance with the everyman action movie, there\\'s no surprises in Paul Blart: Mall Cop, another largely listless comedy from Sandler\\'s Happy Madison production company.In places the plot sags a bit and some jokes don\\'t quite hit their mark or tickle the funny bone as much as they\\'re obviously meant to.James is much better than a lot of his contemporaries at this, eschewing over-the-top clowning for actual humanity. But it all gets thrown out the window in the second half. Maybe he\\'ll do better next time.Neither good enough to to really cheer for nor bad enough to really care about trashing it, it exists in that room-temperature middle where nothing feels like it matters....a hopelessly underwhelming comedy...Unfunny, unoriginal and tedious - Mall Cop is successful only at living up to the standard set by past films that have begun with the words \\'A Happy Madison Production\\'.It\\'s only almost the making of a comedy classic.An unfunny comedy with a limited imagination and a steady diet of fat jokes.The numerous making-of featurettes includes a treat for those of us in eastern Massachusetts with the Burlington Mall highlighted......a genial, inoffensive little comedy that coasts on the charm of its \"King of Queens\" star James...What\\'s most disappointing here is that Kevin James appears capable of far more rich and subtle comedy than he\\'s ever likely to be part of in a Happy Madison production.I found myself really quite enjoying this film, partly for its cheerful guying of mall culture. The heroine, Amy, works on a hair extension stand called Unbeweavable.There\\'s no doubt that James is a fine comedic actor and the role of Paul Blart fits his big frame like a well worn glove. As writers, however, he and Bakay rely too heavily on slapstick...James makes a funny, likeable doofus, and the expansion of his girth since his hit sitcom The King of Queens is used to great comic effect.Men of a certain size will love Paul Blart - and his pursuit through the centre is remarkably inventive. Truly for all the family.Although juvenile, predictable and utterly forgettable, has an endearing central character in Kevin JamesWith only some scattershot scenes of physical humor, \\'Paul Blart: Mall Cop\\' does little to keep viewers safe from boredom.to my surprise, once the action part of the story kicked in, \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" transformed into a rather enjoyable comic adventure.An \\'arresting\\' comedy. James\\' best work.Paul Blart: Mall Cop is a tongue-planted-firmly-in-cheek force to be reckoned with.a good-natured, but awkward and often unfunny comedy that bounces from sad-sack pathos to slapstick action parodyYou can\\'t be too hard on a film that blows up a Rainforest Cafe, can you?Thanks to Kevin James\\' earnest portrayal of an earnest guy, I was won over by the film\\'s goofy charms.I know this is January, the month where dreadful movies go to die, and I know we have to take what we can get. But this? Spring has rarely seemed so far away.I really, really like Kevin James. But this is disappointing.Like a mall, has long stretches where you see nothing of interest and a generally stale air to it. Unlike a mall, you can\\'t just browse and then move on to a better section.There\\'s nothing quite like the words \\'Happy Madison Productions\\' appearing on the screen to diminish my expectations concerning the movie about to unfold.Kevin James throws his weight around as the dedicated mall cop, but sometimes his actions are more silly than funny.This isn\\'t brain surgery; this is daffy entertainment that plays to its strengths, with director Steve Carr trusting in James\\' deadpan earnestyJames takes a Segway, a cheesy mustache and the comic idea of Die Hard in a mall and bumbles his way to a lightweight but frequently funny film for the whole family.James gives it everything he\\'s got, totally committing to the character and delivering clean comedy which often times is often more difficult than creating just a raunch-fest.The hero is named for a disgusting bodily function that\\'s hardly PG material, but the movie itself seems to be aimed at grade schoolers.It\\'s a trivial pursuit, slathered with peanut butter.A couple of Segway jokes stretched to an hour and a half running time....this is a masterpiece compared to anything Rob Schneider has put out only it suffers from the same form of stereotyping.Just one long pratfall...an avalanche of really dumb action comedy that aims to be a variant on the Inspector Clouseau formula but fails miserably.Mall cops everywhere should sue. The movie is trash.I just love this guy,\" James says of Paul Blart in the movie\\'s production notes. For the sake of humanity I hope and pray that barely anyone else shares his affection.Kevin James\\' slapstick comedy will amuse older tweens.Forget the rocky character development. Give me a fat guy falling down, and I\\'ll start to laugh.The road from TV star to movie leading man is loaded with ill-conceived films.The last name Blart may be the funniest thing in the movie, so that\\'s a hint as to just how bad this shopping-center saga can be.It\\'s surprisingly okay, in a January kind of way.Paul Blart: Mall Cop is like the many variations on tuna surprise that show up at potlucks: generic but with a little something added to differentiate it.As cheapo larks go, it\\'s a winningly unassuming one: no stars, no big action set pieces. Just a fat guy, a near-empty mall, and a lot of really ridiculous ideas.It\\'s just not particularly funny. That Segway, alas, only goes so far.Paul Blart tepidly goes through its motions, but that doesn\\'t mean you have to.Just as James struggles to make unfunny material tolerable, so too does the supporting cast fall flat.Directed by Steve Carr, a man who knows how to put a camera in front of things, if little else, and written, sort of, by Nick Bakay and Mr. James.It\\'s a juvenile motion picture designed primarily for a juvenile audience. But there\\'s a little more here than one might reasonably expect.Laughs occasionally ensue.Avoid this mall cop and just go shopping instead.Perfectly inoffensive and almost entirely unfunny.[The film] oo often settles for easy, lazy jokes, most of which revolve around either food or running into stuff.Paul Blart: Mall Cop is so inconsequential you forget about it even before the movie is over.Some people really love goofy comedy, and for those people there\\'s Paul Blart: Mall Cop. You can bring the kids.James, at his best when he lets loose, plays his character a little too straight and so loses some of the movie\\'s comic potential.Sensationally stupid, haphazardly made and qualifying as unmitigated trash by any standards, Paul Blart: Mall Cop also manages to be consistently hilarious, thanks to star Kevin James.This comedy from Adam Sandler\\'s Happy Madison production company takes itself too seriously for its own good.Surprisingly winning.Working from a script co-written by James, the film feels like a Die Hard parody that\\'s at least a decade too late. It\\'s sophomoric and rudimentary, the whole thing offering so few laughs I almost fell asleep in the theater while watching it.To call this Kevin James comedy fatuous might be misinterpreted as an attack on the star\\'s girth -- so how about inane, tepid, lazy, puerile, phony, and unfunny?It\\'s unlikely that even WALL-E could bring himself to scoop up this movie and leave it on his post-apocalyptic junk heap.You might chuckle occasionally as the film drones on to a close, but mostly you\\'ll be wondering when it will all end.Producer Adam Sandler must have though so little of the film that he didn\\'t even see it fit for a Rob Schneider cameo....a silly film that exists primarily as a vehicle for James... this marks the emergence of a comedy star who may get to fulfill the promise he shows here in films to come.Oh my goodness, it\\'s a ripoff of Die Hard. A shameless ripoff that gets more and more shameless the longer it goes on...Paul Blart delivers laughs, yes, but it\\'s only one great slapstick actor and a little bit of heart away from being just another truly idiotic comedy.Never delivers the big laughs this star in this promising premise really should.Parental Content ReviewAdept at physical comedy, Kevin James -- who co-wrote the \\'Paul Blart: Mall Cop\\' script -- emerges the king of his retail domain.Boring and predictable in both its narrative and its aesthetics, Paul Blart: Mall Cop is dumbed-down, low-rent slapstick with stereotypes galore and a violent undercurrent that doesn\\'t sit well.James, who co-wrote, endows the title character with such piercing sweetness that even his geeky pretensions are endearing.This dim-bulb, family-oriented slapstick film benefits greatly from James\\' knack for physical comedy, but it\\'s ultimately too bland and uninspired....after a dismal first half hour, it changes from a piteous low intellect attempt at humor to a light-hearted takeoff on Bruce Willis and the \"Die Hard\" movies.unfathomably unfunny... centered around mean-spirited fat jokesA senseless Hollywood comedy.Not a bad premise, but most of the comedy just dies. Hard.[Has] such obviously humble intentions that busting on it is a bit like harassing the junior high school outcast who just wants to eat his tater tots in peace.A shamelessly sentimental comedy with a few crude gags thrown in arbitrarily.Unlike James himself, the movie is a few bricks shy of a load, which explains why a movie obviously ticketed for a holiday release has backed up to mid-January.The film is completely forgettable, frequently funny and weirdly satisfying in a Jersey Loser Gets Respect kind of way.[James\\'] remarkably winning performance turns Blart into the ultimate underdog--a decent guy who\\'s finally having the kind of day he deserves.Paul Blart: Mall Cop is a slapstick comedy with a hero who is a nice guy. I thought that wasn\\'t allowed anymore.Give this to Paul Blart: Mall Cop: It delivers on everything it promises. Which is to say, nearly nothing.Somewhere beneath its mediocre comedic trappings, there\\'s a decent action movie trying to fight its way free.The end product won\\'t win any Oscars, but the edges of this slapstick action film retain James\\'s blitzkrieg sense of humor, making for a light comic adventure I\\'m positive kids will flip for.If you are a Kevin James fan you probably will want to see him rolling around, otherwise you can pass on this one to save a few bucks.Like the movie\\'s sad-sack hero, this comedy never comes close to achieving its real potential.The thin comic appeal of Kevin James is laid on a bit thicker in Paul Blart: Mall Cop, his first solo star vehicle for the big screen.An almost shockingly amateurish one-note-joke comedy on which the star also shares writing and producing credit.[Kevin James] proves to be a warm leading man who grounds the movie as it morphs into a loopy heist thriller after a promising start as something entirely different: a gentle comedy of suburban underachievement.TV\\'s King of Queens working stiff James relocates to Jersey in an even larger than life silly but good natured big screen laughathon, as the corpulent crimefighter who\\'s more than a little obsessive about cornering anyone shopping around for trouble.James and Mays are engaging and a handful of moments do generate genuine laughs. Not enough to justify a paid night at the movies...The shot of Blart quietly crawling into a hostage situation inside the mall\\'s bank and walking through a roped line is a moment of absurd grace, only it\\'s shot with the vulgarity of a Crash Test Dummies commercial.The talented cast works hard to keep this souffle from falling. Because of Roberts, America\\'s Sweethearts is going to be seen by a lot of people. For best results, keep those expectations low.So-so sitcom-like story of estranged movie stars....an egregiously bland piece of work that ultimately makes certain sitcoms look deep by comparison.Lacking originality or true wit, this mildly amusing but utterly banal comedy again demonstrates that Joe Roth is not much of a director and that Billy Crystal can do only one thing as an actor--be Billy Crystal.Could have been more with such a great cast, but still manages to entertain.It gets a little funnier toward the end, making up for the draggy first half . . . However, the shelf-life of this Sweetheart should be short indeed.Slight, but at least fitfully funny.A loose-limbed, occasionally funny movie of many madly spinning teacups sunk by uninvested-in characters and niggling, wrongheaded details.Inevitably there are some funny moments, and of course this is an endlessly watchable cast. But the movie is just too over-the-top.The film isn\\'t just banal, it\\'s aggressively, arrogantly banal.When it peeks behind the scenes, the movie can be very, very funny.A timely comedy that pokes fun at all things Hollywood.Disappointment comes from the sense that the picture started off with the promise of being something different, maybe even something scathing, but then settles for something rather routine.The fact that this movie contains some of the most annoying, mannered actors on film today and still remains painless is quite a feat.Its potential as a spicy spoof of Hollywood\\'s incestuous relation with the entertainment press has been Ephroned away in favor of bland romantic comedy.The writers turn out to be brandishing butter knives instead of scalpels. ... the movie\\'s real surprise is the feisty, vigorous turn by Zeta-Jones, who throws off zingers with grace and style.The kind of flick that gives fluff a good name.There have been a lot of movies about how fake Hollywood is, but this is the fake Hollywood movie about how fake Hollywood is.The premise falters along with much of the shtick.Joe Roth steps back into the director\\'s chair after nearly a decade and AMERICA\\'S SWEETHEARTS suffers the same diffused focus that his earlier efforts. After the tightly-paced opening, the film flounders until all the major players have been introduced.The movie is intended as an effervescent fizz; instead, it\\'s a fizzle. What should have been a knockout punch turns out to be more of a gentle poke in the ribs.You have to suffer through the de facto Miss America, Julia Roberts, pretending as though she\\'s blending in with the furniture.Lo adorable de su elenco, lo divertido de su trama y su atractivo reparto, la hacen sumamente disfrutableThe script here is not funny, while the cast -- though star-studded -- is perfunctory.Let me tell you the bottom line: the movie is cute and it\\'s enjoyable.America\\'s Sweethearts feels especially stupid for not offering Azaria\\'s casting as some sort of auto-critique.The so-called \\'behind-the-scenes\\' intrigue often fails to rise above a television sitcom.What happens when satire gets lazy.Both harmlessly cynical and deeply fatuous.Coming out the loser in the mess is Joe Roth, who shows that heading movie studios hasn\\'t done any favors for whatever directorial ability he may have once had.Less a romantic comedy than a scathing commentary on the uselessness and inanity of everyone in Hollywood.The set-up is slow and weak, but once it gets rolling, it works pretty well.As plastic as the films it attempts to lampoon.a tepid update of the screwball comedy formula with vaguely satiric overtonesAmerica\\'s Sweethearts is a balloon, all right -- a lead one.It is ironic that while the film tries to demystify its celebrities by showing their \\'true\\' identities, it simultaneously creates a myth for the Julia Roberts character Kiki.As a Hollywood satire, America\\'s Sweethearts is toothless. As a romance, it is at best a minor pleasure.A boring, brain-dead flop.Too cynically slick and emotionally shallow.As a romantic comedy, America\\'s Sweethearts is atrocious. As a skewering of Hollywood ego, it\\'s actually quite funny.The send-up is doggedly unclever in its attention to the vagaries of fame, insecurities of famous people, and artifice of Hollywood romance.A lackluster screwball comedy and dubious Julia Roberts vehicle.The film does indeed deliver the laughs, and I suppose we can\\'t ask much more than that in these mediocre summer months.The script ... is crisp and fresh, the gags well-aimed and nastily barbed.Gives us television sitcom-like \\'onesa\\' characters ... whose behavior seems prompted by whatever suits the scene rather than any kind of emotional truth.A clunky ribbing of the movie industry.Takes aim at Hollywood and delightfully surprises with a funny and entertaining film.A major studio takes aim at itself in a series of mostly successful sketches parodying the underhanded ways movie companies have of marketing their fare.If it wants to be a romance between [Cusack and Roberts], I\\'ve seen more sparks fly between ostriches.Far too many scenes seem painfully contrived, go nowhere and just aren\\'t humorous. It\\'s silly, but not very funny.A real crowd pleaser with laughs so big and often that you\\'re going to miss some of the lines.Crystal and Co. shoot for the cheapest laughs they can find, and ignore the tougher, smarter ones they might have discovered in so potentially rich a vein as Hollywood\\'s marketing practices.Just funny enough, just romantic enough and just satiric enough to be good.There\\'s nothing wrong with broad and campy humor, but America\\'s Sweethearts rarely gets the tone right.The whole thing shambles when it should crackle.The movie is a polished muddle, fitfully amusing but with no spine.It\\'s a perfectly fine setup for romantic-comedy capering, with enough good one-liners to satisfy. But Roth seems a bit at sea with his powerhouse cast.Doesn\\'t contain a single genuine emotion. It\\'s just as bogus and hollow as the movie business it portrays.Director Roth\\'s only real nerve is in mocking excessive close-ups in the Walken \\'art\\' travesty. His own movie is a brazen, artless parade of them.A film that manages the frustrating feat of being pleasant and misguided at the same time.If you like a little surprise in your movies, don\\'t bother lining up for America\\'s Sweethearts.Think of it as the spoonful of sugar that will help the medicine go down, a drizzle of soft ice cream guaranteed to bring a quick smile to a kid\\'s face on a bad day.Occasionally amusing, but also an irritating mess.As undemanding summer movies go, America\\'s Sweethearts is surprisingly funny and sweet, despite some missed comic opportunities and curious casting choices.A hypocritical purveyor of the same schlock nonsense it pretends to lampoon.For the farce it so desperately wants to be, the film often feels slack and too reliant on so-so punch lines for laughs.Not quite tart, not real sweet.Can\\'t decide if it wants to be a romantic comedy or a sarcastic send-up of all things Hollywood.Once the junket begins the film starts falling apart. Parody and satire are replaced by tired, silly slapstick that is beneath the talents of the actors.The movie is often chaotic and sometimes so silly and broad it borders on slapstick, but mostly it\\'s just dumb fun.You go to America\\'s Sweethearts anticipating a prime flossy, glossy entertainment. You come away better by a few laughs but with expectations sadly deflated.A case study in missed opportunities.Given its subject matter, it\\'s too genial to cut deep.The script is full of half-considered character stances.All these good actors and all Crystal\\'s sass and witty candor can\\'t bring back the heyday of Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges. Or even, most of the time, their off-days.Save for a few crackling wisecracks from Billy Crystal, and some moments of delicious is-she -acting-or -is-it-real insanity from Catherine Zeta-Jones, the fine cast sleepwalks through this film.The film is longer on one-liners than inventiveness, focus, and sharp characterization....it never rises above the level set by the routine, predictable screenplay...Wide parched vistas of monotony separate scrabbly oases of amusement and the payoff for a gag almost never matches the time devoted to its setup.Not so much a terrible movie as a tryingly bland one, the star-stuffed America\\'s Sweethearts actually manages to make Entertainment Tonight seem dangerous by comparison.A fairly hilarious inside-Hollywood farce.Nothing overly special, new or particularly insightful about off-screen romance in Hollywood, but above average for what it\\'s attempting to do and be.The movie has no sparkle, no charm, nothing to sweep us off our feet.A purely forgettable romantic comedy.A terrific romantic comedy about narcissism, insincerity, lunacy and glamour.Like a bottle of lukewarm Champagne -- an expensive one, judging by the label -- America\\'s Sweethearts opens with a promising burst of effervescence and quickly goes flat.Often funny but not that engaging.[Crystal] nearly sinks the medium-sized comedy boat they\\'re all trying to occupy. Still, it\\'s funny enough and forgettable enough that you probably won\\'t mind, especially when Julia shows off her teeth.[T]he jokes mostly fell flat.The flick\\'s got enough charming moments to offer a sweet, if not great, time.It has the misfortune of being both too inside for outsiders and too unlikely for those in the know.For a film that attempts to be a breezy farce, it\\'s a remarkably sour affair with a thinly veiled contempt and self-hatred for just about everything associated with Hollywood these days.You go away reasonably satisfied - not filled up, not delighted, but pleased that your expectations have been met again.A slam-dunk for Julia Roberts.It reminded me of a stand-up comedian who\\'s not sure where his next joke is coming from.Imperfect but entertaining, this self-deprecating film flirts with the public\\'s perception of the Hollywood machine. And flirts are fun.A mildly amusing mess.America\\'s Sweethearts would have been greatly helped by some rat-a-tat banter, but instead you get blather, and plenty of it.It\\'s dull, two-dimensional, and totally toothless.Enormously engaging in its opening segments, it\\'s unable to sustain that good feeling over the long haul.While there are some laughs, this thing misses the mark too many times.Opens with terrific promise, reaches a few dead ends but usually redeems itself.Surprisingly little of the film rings true, as the stock comic situations pile up so quickly that its insider credibility is undermined.Do you wonder how this movie will turn out? As with most romantic comedies, the joy is in the journey.When Sweethearts runs out of sharp gags or crafty in-jokes, it leans too heavily on misplaced, cartoonish slapstick.Disappointingly pedestrian for a movie with such ripe and easy targets for much sharper satire.The ultimate irony is that a film that preaches about the promotion of a dud is itself a dud.I can\\'t recall the last time I\\'ve seen this many supremely talented actors frittered away in such a slight romantic comedy.It\\'s entertaining and funny enough, but like your average quote whore, shows you what you\\'d like to see, even if it\\'s not entirely what is deserved.A Billy Crystal shtick-fest masquerading as romantic-comedy, though it\\'s hardly ever romantic and only occasionally funny.Hollywood may be the dream factory, but this probably isn\\'t the dream the filmmakers had in mind.As romance, America\\'s Sweethearts is as heartfelt as a sitcom; as Hollywood satire, it\\'s as pointed as an issue of Mad.An enjoyable night out.Pleasant old-school comedy with a few modern, edgy twists.One of the most caustic and hilarious looks behind the scenes of movie-making since Bowfinger.A miasma of vanity envelops America\\'s Sweethearts where wit ought to reign.Yawnsville.A deft, old-fashioned combination of jokes and sentiment, the cinematic equivalent of one of Crystal\\'s opening monologues at the Academy Awards.America\\'s Sweethearts begins as a smartly promising, gently farcical comedy of manners and ends as sourly and haphazardly as the lives it is poking fun at.Has its share of memorable funny moments. Why would I want any of these jerks to be happy?Trite, unfunny, boring and a waste of everyone\\'s talent.Leaves you shaking your head over a lost opportunity to make a really great comedy.Creative and extremely fun to watch.nannannannannannannannannannannannannannanA lot of the themes and language in the movie haven\\'t aged well...the soundtrack is amazing, though.To be admired rather than enjoyed, but a considerable achievement nonetheless.Outside the rap slams, either the acting or the persona is a bit joyless. The best review I can give a drama or an actor: When the film ends you still believe the character lives on.While not exactly wow, Eminem is solid and credible in a role which could so easily have screeched like chalk across a wet blackboard.A refreshing way to build a story that is ghoulishly overfamiliar in nearly all its particulars.It\\'s easy to like Jimmy Smith as well as to admire him, because Mr. Mathers lets us in, with no sign of calculation, on the kindness, even tenderness, that Jimmy conceals from most of the people around him.What saves all this from being purely conventional is the filmmaker\\'s keen sense of Rabbit\\'s essential solitude as an artist, even when surrounded by friends.Director Curtis Hanson puts a new spin on the familiar \"triumph against the odds\" theme with this slick showcase for the talents of superstar rapper Eminem.It ain\\'t Eminem: The Movie but it does showcase Eminem: The Actor -- easily the best rapper-cum-thesp since Tupac Shakur.Despite the predictable formula, screenwriter Scott Silver wisely avoids taking the easy route every time; there are several small twists you may not expect, and the ending isn\\'t entirely a happy one.Because it rejects easy victories, this may be one of the few inspirational movies that could actually inspire someone, somewhere, sometime.The movie has some of the braggadocio of its white-trash hero, building to its competitive climax as if it were a gladiatorial sporting event, and it carried me all the way.While no masterpiece, it is infinitely superior to the sad movie debuts of Britney Spears and Mariah Carey.Another fine effort from a director currently on a critical roll. Hanson is great at teasing the audience with little samples of his star\\'s lyrical dexterity as he builds towards the finale.Eminem\\'s edgy, graphic quasi-biopic is not for kids.I was able to guess what would happen to most of the characters most of the time and come through perfectly.... Rocky with a rap beat ....You can\\'t stop him or crop him/He\\'s in widescreen and large/He ain\\'t playing when he\\'s baggin\\' Curtis Hanson for Sarge... [Blu-ray]Ends on a high note, but it doesn\\'t negate the tedium of the number of false and mostly flat ones that precede it.Eminem is quietly effective without ever displaying much emotion. It\\'s a commendable film debut and he never falls into the vanity trap that many artists find when transferring their talents from the music stage to the screen.The film is really no more than a two-hour prelude to a climax in which our hero ... rhythmically tells people off.It is more just a pleasure to watch Eminem perform. He is fiercely talented and has a natural charisma; the camera loves him. But, like most of the story, we knew that before we saw the film. A hesitant presence whose vulnerability pulls you in, Eminem emerges as a mainstream movie star and effectively lays to rest the spooks of Slim Shady: impressionable parents will love this eminently responsible film.The movie doesn\\'t feel authentic and I think it\\'s because of all the white folks involved.Like his wizardly lyrics, Eminem\\'s performance and his film have unexpected depth.Eminem does a credible roughed-up urban ghetto impression of James DeanHanson\\'s enthusiastic participation in the project is bewildering given how pedestrian the story is: poor, white kid keeps getting beaten down before a final showdown...This Eminem melts in your hand and not in your mouth.Following L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys, this makes a remarkable hat-trick for Hanson and is a personal triumph for Eminem.Better than average rags-to-riches story, but expect to get pinched for a special edition DVD later.Una buena pelcula, un ms que digno debut actoral para una estrella de rap, y una estupenda banda sonora. Nada mal, eh?If not strictly autobiography, the movie is close enough to Eminem\\'s story that he knows how this character feels. If this turns out to be the only role he ever plays -- which I doubt -- he can be happy that he played it to the limit.Despite the weak story, Hanson commands a strong performance from Eminem and showcases both the rapper\\'s newfound acting abilities and his musical talent.Director Hanson skillfully creates the oppressive nature of urban poverty with the dirt, grit, and darkness that remains prevalent throughout...There are brawls enough to provide the flavor of how life in the darker reaches of Motown can be.Eminem summons things from deep inside himself to shed away ego and portray a calm, frustrated, worried kid who doesn\\'t even talk too much.The problem is Eminem himself, who has clearly been drilled by the director to play to what will have to pass as strengths: stillness, cool, control.It\\'s a movie that showcases director Curtis Hanson working at the very height of his craft, but only to break even.Who could have predicted that a rap movie starring Eminem would, at its best, be one of the year\\'s sweetest joyrides?What screamed a ridiculous idea or vanity project when you first read or head about it is the exact opposite - a well thought out and realised film which never thinks too much of itself.Eminem\\'s skill still lies in turning an inventive phrase: filled with characters who lack depth, his film debut falls victim to its own modesty and is often insubstantial and boring.Eminem is such a commanding visual presence, diversely eloquent of patience, ire, and weariness, that his silent poses and solitary interludes become many of the film\\'s most effective scenes.Everything that happens feels inevitable, achingly obvious -- the abuse, the betrayals, the arguments, the reconciliations, the tiny defeats, the bigger victories.The script is uninspired, the picture\\'s characters are stick figures, its dialogue is lackluster and the star\\'s performance seldom rises above the adequate.There\\'s no power fantasies here, no ego trips or fairy tale stories about a loser made good. In this case, the persona serves the story, not the other way around.The story is all right: The picture\\'s real excellence is its portrait of the society in which it takes place.A solidly built, rather old-fashioned yarn about a plucky underdog who triumphs in the face of adversity.Eminem manages to take all that we think we know about Eminem and inject it into his character without turning the character into a simple screen version of himself.Extremely enjoyable film, with a winning performance from Eminem -- essentially this is the Hip-Hop version of Rocky. In a good way.That the final rap battle feels so electrifying rather than merely coming across as the usual rah-rah climax taps directly into the energy emanating from Eminem as he gives his character a real presence.Not since Rocky brought Silvester Stallone to virtually instant stardom has there been a more effective attempt to repeat the phenomenon.Eminem gives a focused, intelligent performance.Eminem proves himself on the big screen with this extremely well-made film loosely based on his own life in innercity Detroit.The unique format of the motion picture shows how valuable it can be, for what else can be used to so vividly capture the most important element in a story like this -- its cultural setting?It\\'s disappointing, sort of like if Madonna had released her \"Sex\" book without the sex.Even [Eminem\\'s] most devoted admirers likely will be surprised by his ability to keenly render and compellingly sustain a character throughout a feature-length film.If this movie had been directed by someone other than Curtis Hanson; I\\'m talking some nobody shmoe or some flashy music video director, critics would have dismissed this as just another singer-turned-actor star vehicle with no more depth than a shot glassEm\\'s lowdown, dirty diatribe may sound like treason, but you might discover that his rhyme is the reason.First Adam Sandler\\'s in an art film. Now Eminem\\'s in a \"sports\" movie...go figure.However you view it, it\\'s a story that\\'s been told before. And yet, it works.A decent, American, inspirational, Rocky-esque story.If Eminem is a genius then Tiny Tim must be God.A powerful film that shows us the frustration and desperation of an entire emotionally neglected sub-class, its bravura \\'rap battles\\' offering up the strongest prima facie connection between hip-hop\\'s chest-thumping and adolescence\\'s shoe-gazing.Eminem plays a guy named \"Rabbit,\" and he doesn\\'t get any respect. Maybe going by the name \"Rabbit\" isn\\'t the route to respect, yo.Then there are the rap sequences where Eminem displays an energy close to unrivaled by any performance this year. In these scenes, he and the film show what they\\'re really made of.We\\'ve seen these character types before, but through the lens of Curtis Hanson, we suffer, carouse and dream right along with them.A brilliant, engaging examination of people who dream of escape.If the part is not much of a mental or emotional stretch for him, [Eminem] acquits himself well enough for me to want to see him in other films.Can Eminem act? Yes, I am happy to report.Rabbit\\'s story is galvanizing and Eminem is a superstar. But hiphop has more and other stories to tell.Who wastes time watching Tiger Woods/When real action comes from the boyz in the hoods?There is a quietude to the film, even though it is punctuated by a lot of music and even more yelling. Its mood is soft and even humble.A movie that will capture the attention of anyone who remembers what it was like when music was a crucial component of their daily existence.Certainly the best first film ever by a musician crossing over to the acting world.So paper thin that the former \\'king of controversy\\' was able to cram the entire plot into one little crossover rap song that\\'s currently playing at a radio station near you.Packs as much humor, hard truth and vitality as the rapper\\'s LPs.A by-the-numbers storyline, complete with character actions that don\\'t make a lick of sense because of how underdeveloped they are.[Eminem] does a lot of things right. So does the movie.The payoff comes after an hour and a half of a long, criminally tiresome setup.Eminem steals the picture from a cast with snap down to the smallest parts.What\\'s most disappointing is the thoroughly cliched story.Underwhelming.Both in film and music, he tantalizes us with autobiographical detail while dazzling us with wit, grit, insight, profane humor and mind-boggling wordplay.The triumph here is that Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver have found a fresh way to tell this story.Funny, well-acted and surprisingly engaging.Is Eminem a movie star? Only when he raps.The film is emotionally charged, almost naturally so, with Hanson\\'s direction stressing the pop rapture that music can provide in a world that\\'s dirty and ugly.Eminem delivers a performance of considerable passion and depth.Essentially a downtrodden-teen -makes-good film ... That\\'s not a bad thing, but it\\'s nothing to rap home about, either.Merely a solid, conventional drama, because it ultimately loses sight of one very important fact: Eminem is at his best when he\\'s making people angry, not when he\\'s asking for their sympathy.It\\'s raw, it\\'s intense and it\\'s very engrossing.[Eminem] goes the mile demanded of him and he emerges a certified winner this time out.While it\\'s doubtful that Eminem could run out and perform Shakespeare tomorrow, his talents on screen -- in this role -- are astounding.Uneven but watchable.Rapper Eminem\\'s film debut is far better than you\\'d think -- and a pure demonstration of the power of charisma.After just a few years in the spotlight, Eminem has accomplished something Elvis, Madonna, Michael and Mariah have not: He\\'s made a great movie.Is it worth a look? Sure. Is it begging to be parodied? Without a doubt...somebody alert the Wayans.Say what you want about Eminem, but the guy has passion and a gift with words - the finale at the battle simply rocks the house.Elegant and tough, unpretentiously directed by Curtis Hanson, it doesn\\'t for a second pander to what is supposed to be the star\\'s target audience.Eminem wipes away his hubris, revealing a trembling, self-doubting kid on the way up.[Nothing] more than an Elvis film, except there\\'s a lot more sex and violence than Blue Hawaii and the music video sequences feature creative profanity instead of surfboards.All this hoopla about Eminem\\'s so great, is it any more of a stretch than Prince in \"Purple Rain\" or Babs in \"A Star is Born\" or Woody in any movie where he\\'s having an affair with a younger woman?The movie is a success on its own terms because the director doesn\\'t condescend to pop music.A fascinating, surprisingly entertaining stand-off that has adroitly managed to satisfy both of its constituencies, allowing all sides to legitimately claim victory.What saves all this from being purely conventional is the filmmaker\\'s keen sense of Rabbit\\'s essential solitude as an artist, even when surrounded by friends.What\\'s pretty amazing here is that Hanson has managed to take Scott Silver\\'s lameass script and mediocre acting and turn it into something special.Backed by a smart story that avoids easy answers and pat endings, the rapper may be in line for some real acting recognition.You have to question the time and care you want to invest in a character whose goal is to excel at insultsThe way this movie is made, the way this story is told, this is what is meant by the phrase \"keepin\\' it real.Middle-aged folks may not be attracted to the film\\'s rap base but the built in youth demographic will love it.Basically recycles all the old, tired cliches that abound in every story about the rise to stardom of poor but talented youngsters who overcome terrible obstacles in their drive to succeed.This movie is all about the dingy glamour of self-pitying rage.Wounded and enigmatic, Eminem is a worthy focus.Eminem is magnetic playing a version of himself.Eminem proves capable of carrying the lead, at least when the material is tailored to fit. Rather than show great range in his first outing, he gives an effective slow burn.Qualifies as a cinematic event by tapping into the roots of Eminem and the fury and feeling that inform his rap.O.K., so I\\'m the wrong audience for this teenage junk.Gritty and electrifying.A movie that will satisfy hip-hop and Eminem fans in ways they never expected; even more significantly, it will touch people who thought they hated hip-hop and/or Eminem in ways they would have never expected.Tony Manero, Rocky Balboa, Eminem. It\\'s a dazzling debut and an important movie.The dialogue sometimes gets so silly and redundant when trying to push Bunny Rabbit\\'s talent that I expected to see Waterboy\\'s Rob Schneider pop out and shout \"You can do it Eminem\".Eminem kept his cool, and his new movie was straight dope.Effective, if not more than a little dishonest. Think Blue Crush with swear words.As a vanity project, the film is more tolerable than Purple Rain but it\\'s every bit as obvious and redundant.Eminem\\'s performance as the struggling actor is very impressive.A canny, and largely successful, attempt to broaden the star\\'s appeal.Writer Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson dig deep into the subculture to deliver a terrific movie.I would imagine most of the exaggerated praise Mile has received is in direct correlation to the stupid pictures most rap-rock-pop stars have made in vain attempts to become movie stars.nannannannannanComic action, appealing hero, splendid dogs; some scares.Horrible acting, horrible script, and horrible direction plague this fiasco of a movie.Snow Dogs\" doesn\\'t offer much, but to be fair, it had the youngest viewers at my screening cheering and laughing until the end.Whoever let the dogs out should probably consider a career change....As fleeting and insubstantial as a snowflake, and about as much fun.While kids will probably eat the whole thing up, most adults will be way ahead of the plot.What Faustian bargain did Gooding make, forcing him to star in this insipid fish-out-of-water comedy that paints him as a Bolton fan?This is a family film like they used to make, where the humour balances the drama, the personal tragedies are life lessons and the animals are so darn cute, by golly.The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did.A movie full of gestures that would look over-the-top in primary school plays.Gooding is so pleasant and likable, it\\'s hard to get mad at him for wasting our time....this isn\\'t even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels.For some reason, Disney keeps making really, really crappy live-action films.There\\'s not much to like or dislike in this ride; it\\'s the kind of all-season, live-action amusement that the Disney studio has been churning out for decades.If I told you that your children DESERVED this movie, you\\'d slap my face.Large doses of slapstick humor and Gooding\\'s vitality keep Snow Dogs from slipping into dull \\'family entertainment.\\'Releasing a film with the word \\'dog\\' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults, and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them.Slapstick stunts, silliness, and shallow sentiment, with little else to satisfy moviegoers who want more than Cuba Gooding Jr. falling down and mugging for the camera.This may be the worst movie to star two Oscar winners since the heyday of the studios when actors had no say in their projects.It\\'s all very cute, though not terribly funny if you\\'re more than six years old.Pre-packaged dog crap, a dumb movie made by dull-witted adults who clearly believe that just because some viewers currently reside at the lower end of the age spectrum, they don\\'t deserve better.If the restless children in the movie theatre are any indication, the movie is just as uninteresting for them as it is tiresome for the adults.Two Oscar-winners are no match for irresistible dogs in this so-so slapstick comedy.Instantly forgettable.Phoned-in business as usual.If you have a soft spot for man\\'s best friend, it\\'s a pretty good throwaway movie.This silly youth-targeted comedy goes strictly by the book, which should give you a clue as to its quality.Sure to test the patience of even those adults who will appreciate it simply for being an innocuous enough film that most of the family can see together.There\\'s little to recommend Snow Dogs, unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity.The picture may be light as five inches of new powder, but it\\'s still good for a family romp.A film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers.Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot, no real conflict, no real point.Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance.A movie set in the frozen north that just idles, endlessly, in the sitcom hothouse where convention slowly but surely becomes moldy cliche.Show me the mugging.When in doubt, the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack, throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip. Or else a doggie winks.Manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state.Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs, but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy.A ripoff of Northern Exposure.The corny jokes and the tired plot will make any self-respecting adult grimace.Amiable and full of good cheer, [Gooding] warms this cold-weather comedy.Like shave ice without the topping, this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless.Perhaps the movie is working with the theory that if you do a schtick a million times, it eventually becomes funny. In this case, it really doesn\\'t.With its unimaginative slapstick sequences, Gooding\\'s toothy mugging and an unforgivable plug for Michael Bolton, Snow Dogs is adrift.Snow Dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than himThis amiable, old-fashioned family film is ... a straightforward fish-out-of-water tale with lessons for the little ones and a surprisingly earnest and moving performance from James Coburn.Forget the dogs; who let this movie out?It\\'s playful, corny, silly, adventuresome and enjoyable.Disney\\'s latest update of the lame live-action B comedies that have been among the studio\\'s more dubious contributions to American pop culture.Director Brian Levant, who never strays far from his sitcom roots, skates blithely from one implausible situation to another, pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you\\'ll find on a French poodle.Its aims are modest -- to make kids laugh as Cuba Gooding falls down a lot and to show how thrilling sled dogs are -- and it achieves them.This is a fine example of old-fashioned Disney movie-making magic at its best.Poor Cuba Gooding. As if it were not humiliating enough to play a guy so clumsy that he can\\'t walk in the snow without pratfalling, he also has to do jokes about being a black man in the Great White North.All actors anxiously awaiting Oscar nominations in hopes of a career boost should go to Snow Dogs and gaze upon Cuba Gooding Jr.Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners, a fact which, as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs, seems inconceivable.If you\\'ve never read the book, Snow Dogs may simply be a stupid waste of your time. But if you know the source, it\\'s an abomination.A mongrel of a movie--scruffy, obvious and slightly disreputable...the best one can say of it is that it could have been worse.The movie just doesn\\'t take any of its situations far enough. Resulting in let down after let down.The huskies are beautiful, the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent.A hodge-podge of buffoonery and bad animal jokes the late Jim Varney would turn his nose up at.This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane, inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions.Adults, other than the parents...will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild.the type of broad, fish out of water comedy where each crossed signal is telegraphed a mile away and the lead character falls down a lotJanuary is the month when the studios like to dump their dogs, and this film is a real mutt.As distressed as a comedy can be without qualifying as a snow emergency.Frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances...keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease.A fast paced comedic race through the wilds of Alaska. Cuba Gooding Jr. and the dogs provide solid entertainment for the whole family.Despite the usual pratfalls, a cute snow job.Gooding is the energetic frontman, and it\\'s hard to resist his enthusiasm, even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences.nannannannannannanThe narrative is clunking and lazy, there to get characters from A to B without any respect for coherence or us, the audience. I like the actors, but the movie did them no justice.A Tyler Perry movie for white folks. Couples Retreat is a lazy, unimaginative comedy that, with the talent on show, should have been a whole lot more than another boring rom-com to throw on the pile....an utterly incompetent comedic affair...A bit of a guilty pleasure. But, most of the humor falls flat. Interesting that it\\'s a Vince Vaughn vehicle that doesn\\'t give Vaughn enough to do. Paul Chambers, CNN.full review at Movies for the MassesInstead of being a sharp, witty comedy about married couples experiencing vacation therapy together, it\\'s more of a pinheads-in-paradise routine with only a few funny lines.It\\'s some kind of trick when a film can make Jason Bateman look unsubtle.Somewhere in all of this, there is the potential for a pretty good comedy, but this movie isn\\'t it.Couples is so formulaic, so fake and relentlessly bland, it\\'s hard to care if any of these pairings get a divorce, drown or are eaten by sharks. It has neither the ring of truth nor the fun of fantasy.Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, wrote the witless script, so have only themselves to blame.The debutant director is done no favours by a screenplay from Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau which gives him little to play with and them few chances to shine as actors.A patchwork collection of derivative gags and relationship drama that seems leftover from old \\'thirtysomething\\' episodes.Retreat as quickly as possible.For all its visual splendor, to say nothing of its likable cast, the movie never feels as liberating as its locale.Why couldn\\'t Couples Retreat have been lighthearted and zany throughout, instead of trying to push across a message about picket-fence monogamy?Couples Retreat comes across as a movie that was made... because it was felt that if the right buttons were pushed, this might make money.That the wonderful French actor Jean Reno plays the therapist is a sign that his agent is not doing a good enough job finding him film roles in American movies.This couples-in-conflict comedy starts strongly but then slips into the turquoise water of paradise lost.Bora Bora was a beautiful location to film at and added that much needed taste of paradise to a rather bitter sweet subject of a troubled marriage.A rom-com short on romance and even shorter on laughs.Expectations of farce are stymied by long stretches of mid-life navel gazing.Rather like an unsuitable partner, Couples Retreat starts out fun before gradually getting annoying and then becoming downright aggravating. While it\\'s not the worst film ever, there are times when it feels as irritating as sunburn.It is this vanity, this overweening self-regard, that makes Couples Retreat such a chore to sit through.A loo book written by Pol Pot would have more laughs than this chillingly unfunny, cynically prefabricated non-comedy.The only thing that will keep your attention for the duration is the stunning Tahitian scenery that acts the films setting. On reflection this is probably what swayed most of the cast to sign up to this inane guff of a film in the first place.Entertainment on a par with sitting through your neighbours\\' holiday slideshow.Universal\\'s latest is merely adequate, and will likely be best enjoyed by the happily indulgent and mildly inebriated.About as much fun as having a holiday ruined by bickering, self-involved couples, this is one romcom you really should retreat from.A trip to the innermost circle of comedy hell.A comedy deserving to be buried up to its head in sand, drizzled in cooking oil and then left to fry until crispy.Fewer laughs than the average episode of ITV\\'s Benidorm.Sadly for us though, Favreau and Vaughn are likely to continue their profitable relationship for some time to come.If it were a send-up of couples therapy and its absurd language the film would at least be about something, but it hasn\\'t even that much intelligence.Vaughn manages to grab more screen time to showcase his charisma but do we really need to watch his midlife crisis unfold over the course of nearly two hours?The script for this comedy is so half-baked that we begin to wonder why it was made at all. Not only is it resolutely unfunny, but it never dips beneath a superficial examination of relationship cliches....truly dismal...This is a movie to avoid.Floundering, only intermittently funny. Wait for the dvd.Hugely disappointing, painfully unfunny comedy that completely wastes its talented cast and then compounds the misery with a dismal script.Couples, retreat: this movie has the power to make any date feel as endless and soul-sucking as the lifetime\\'s worth of defective, hateful marriages that doom the film\\'s protagonists.It\\'s too easy to say that Peter Billingsley shot his eye out with this inept comic trifle, but...well, he shot his eye out.The actresses are so wasted, they\\'re even demoted to fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth billing under every one of the dudes. At least the guys aren\\'t having fun either.Good for some laughs and some likable characters; Vaughn and Favreau stand out while Bateman fades into the backgrounda Tyler Perry movie for the rest of America, without so much melodramaA bit like getting relationship advice from a clown. A really, really unfunny one.Although it has its moments, Couples Retreat isn\\'t so much a movie but rather a giant excuse for some real-life BFFs to hang out in South Pacific.Tawdry and tedious, \\'Couples Retreat\\' is a retread of the almost equally unfunny \\'License to Wed.\\'Mandatory marriage counseling ruins vacation in battle-of-the-sexes sitcom.With Couple\\'s Retreat, we\\'re hoping for a Wedding Crashers redux we can turn into a date night. But all we get is something else to bitch about.I feel no pity for Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau who co-wrote the piece. For their co-stars...we hope this career-killer is worth the paycheck.The secret to a happy marriage involves falling in love over and over again with the same person. \\'Couples Retreat\\' offers an amusing illustration of that old saying.We have another durable candidate for a slew of Razzie Awards... Vaughn plays the same persona in every movie. He has a blustery, cocksure swagger on the outside while hiding his deep-seated insecurities.The former swingers settle for standard gags in the moderately amusing Couples RetreatFor a great deal of its running time it is raw, uncompromising and very, very funny, and even when things hit a dry spell I was still moved and amused enough to not particularly care.The twosome that sparks most agreeably is Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau. ... The humor isn\\'t always highbrow, but it works.Couples Retreat is like watching somebody\\'s boring vacation videos, except that they\\'re filled with big stars.This is one of those films, like last week\\'s Whip It and so many others of late, that looks like it was a lot fun to make. It\\'s just not all that much fun to watch.The \"retreat\" in the title is surely a warning to any potential ticket buyers.Couples Retreat is a comedy/drama mix, but it\\'s mostly the comedy parts that work.There are also scenes, the disjointed kind that wander off aimlessly in the vague hope of finding a movie, not to mention a laugh.Couples Retreat is a comedy of exhaustion. But it is the comedy itself, in both concept and execution, that seems tired.Greatly silly and unexpectedly wise at times.This deeply unfunny film is further proof that movie comedy these days -- in its acting, writing, directing -- is far below the average sitcom.Has nothing to offer but a lively ensemble cast and beautiful scenery while falling flat as a comedy that\\'s painfully low on laughs and high on juvenile, asinine and uninspired attempts at humor.during the shark attack . . . the sympathy was not necessarily with the humans in the waterAt least Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and their fellow cast and crewmates were able to spend time on a gorgeous tropical island while making this mirthless, half-hearted relationship comedy.Instead of capitalizing on some original issues, the tired standards are glossed over and solved, but not in a funny way.All the marriage-mending becomes really tiresome when all we want is some laughs.A loud, crude, dreary misfire that feels like it was cobbled together from material cut from other lousy comedies.The only way to look at Couples Retreat as a bookend to Swingers is to note how far these two talented stars have fallen.By the time it starts getting dramatic, I was rooting for each one of them to get a divorce.The whole production just comes off as a paid vacation at Club Med for Vaughn and friends.A giant black hole in the center of the comedy universe sucking in the best ideas and situations from other entities into an inescapable ride to nothingness.For those of us who were weened on the idea that we\\'re all \"money, and we don\\'t even know it\" Couples Retreat is a little difficult to see, but is it bad? Not entirely. It\\'s not entirely good either.Couples Retreat is neither funny nor honest. The exact opposite of a retreat, it\\'s merely exhausting.Beneath the ham acting and the relentless banter is a serious movie about relationships. We\\'re being sold laughs, but a few sober thoughts are delivered.It\\'s too bad Couples Retreat is so poorly written and conceived, given the talented cast and chemistry between Vaughn and pal Favreau. We\\'re meant to relate to these hapless folks or laugh at their foibles, but more often we wince.Earnest, not particularly funny, and ultimately unforgivably sentimental. Somewhere along the way someone forgot humour.Vaughn, Favreau and company phone it in - all the way from Bora Bora - in this lame relationship comedy.The film maintains a sufficiently pleasant comic vibe as the couples bicker and pick away at each other, but director Peter Billingsley never really brings matters to a satisfying boil.The cast\\'s enthusiasm goes a long way toward keeping the whole mediocre affair from becoming completely intolerable.This is what passes for middle of the road comedy these days, safe without being prudish, never too disturbing, never too funny.Couples Retreat turns out to be a sloppy, choppy mess.If an easy watch is what you\\'re after this will do the trick, simply keep expectations at a modest level and it won\\'t be a waste of time.Despite the potential for humour from the couples and their relationship problems, the script relies on lame situation jokes.Couples Retreat is ridiculous and whorish, but the minds behind it are too sharp to simply leave it at that.Doesn\\'t have either the guts or wherewithal to follow through with the humor and stick to its setup.Couples Retreat is an unending parade of offensive scenes, a tedious cavalcade of miserable, shallow people with whom we are no doubt supposed to identify but with whom we should hope to see nothing in common.Vaughn/Favreau marriage comedy has lots of sex, drinking.The end result, sad to say, is just about as entertaining as watching someone else\\'s home movies for two solid hoursParental Content ReviewKinda stupid, kinda funny. It\\'s the ultimate fall film.It\\'s not that the laughs aren\\'t there, it\\'s just that they\\'re telegraphed.What\\'s depressing is that there\\'s hardly a creative spark in this sour, offensive, contrived story, and its sloppiness is more consistent than its comedy.Offers nothing new to the tropical vacation comedy ... not even the funniest bits from the commercials really stack up to much of the cast\\'s weakest work to date.A marriage-renewal comedy with a decent cast, a few good ideas and no clear grasp on what to do with them.Enjoy the stunning South Pacific views, but don\\'t expect some enchanted evening.The acting is a mixed bag. Jon Favreau and Faizon Love, who never hit a false note, are the standouts.If you must, go for the scenery.The various therapies -- talk, yoga, massage -- serve only to set up tired insult humor and smarmy sight gags.Trouble in paradise. That\\'s the overly familiar premise of this sun-poisoned comedy.Ever go on a vacation where most of the people around seem to be having more fun than you? Then you already know what it\\'ll feel like to visit Couples Retreat.There\\'s only one winner in this film, and it\\'s Applebee\\'s. Take my word for it and watch some Travel Channel instead.The cast got to spend a month shooting on Bora Bora. So that explains why they\\'re in the movie. Why you\\'d spend good money for a ticket to watch them have all the fun and not have any fun yourself passes understanding.Couples Retreat is a pleasant, undemanding, middle-of-the-road comedy, and really, were you expecting anything else?Billingsley does a good job on selling the beauty of the island, but only a serviceable one in telling this story. Then again, there isn\\'t all that much to tell.We just keep wishing they would get out of the way and let us enjoy the pretty scenery.Imagine that you are listening in on the marriage-counseling sessions of the dullest couple you know. Multiply that by four, and you\\'ve got a pretty good approximation of the experience of watching Couples Retreat....may be set in Bora-Bora, but it\\'s about as much fun as a lock down with an obsessive religious cult.Watching Couples Retreat cowriters Favreau and Vince Vaughn play schlubby husbands is like showing up to your high school reunion to find that the once-sharply dressed cool guys with the fake IDs are now fat and bald. And married.The only really funny moments in Couples Retreat are bits that were clearly ad-libbed by the film\\'s stars, Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau.Yes, there\\'s pointed human comedy to be mined from the very real stresses of married life, but this bonehead idiots-in- paradise farce raises issues only to gloss them over.It\\'s hard to know if more convincing relationships would have made a difference in a movie so committed to funny accents and potty jokes, but at least it would have shown some effort.After traveling to Eden with the shallow, self-involved, unpleasant twits that populate Couples Retreat, you\\'ll be wishing they\\'d all have packed their bags and gone straight to hell, instead.Might be funnier with several rum punches in hand.It\\'s one bland scene after another, played at medium pace with middling creativity, punctuated with a near-desperate attempt at a laughCouples Retreat leaves a good cast stranded without a script, although the cast isn\\'t in much of a position to complain.Every time the performers insinuate some fresh response, the concepts close in on them. I began to dread even the funny bits, because I knew director Peter Billingsley would milk them to death.Before booking a ticket, I urge you to retreat.A comedy without any identifiable humor. Retreat is dreadful, but to consider just how many gifted performers are here treading water makes the heart sick. Ralphie, how dare you.Predictable, but humorous.Couples, retreat.Though I enjoy nearly everyone on-screen in Couples Retreat, I found it pretty meager and more than a little depressing.Couples Retreat is essentially Vaughn and Favreau\\'s baby, and it is absolutely, inexcusably terrible.Maybe it\\'s pointless to complain about the shocking lack of elegance to an instantly forgettable bit of multiplex fluff like Couples Retreat. It\\'s like complaining about the food at Applebee\\'s...On the surface, \"Couples Retreat\" appears to be a quickly stitched together comedy that places a bunch of likable actors in a tropical setting for some cheap laughs. And that\\'s exactly what it is.The scenery makes you want to be somewhere other than a movie theater, and the movie has the same effect.It contains little comedy, except for free-standing one-liners, and no suspense, except for the timing of the obligatory reconciliation. It doesn\\'t even make you think you\\'d like to visit its island paradise.Has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and makes extra effort to insult its audience whenever possible.A few funny lines and ideas emerge here and there, but Couples Retreat mostly feels repetitive and overlong at nearly two hours. You wouldn\\'t mind getting voted off this island.This intermittently funny tale of four couples undergoing relationship therapy struggles hard for its occasional laughs.Those involved got to spend weeks at a Bora Bora luxury resort; all we get is this not lousy but unmemorable tropical-vacation comedy.Couples Retreat plays like the NBA All-Star game: What seems like a dream-team exhibition of pros at the top of their game too often turns into an undisciplined mess.Couples, a sputtering if sporadically amusing misfire, packed a lot of actors off to a pretty location and gave them nothing funny or deep to do.Thanks to Vaughn, Favreau, and the stray sharp lines that pop out of everyone else, the film at least offers the lively sound of egos that still know how to swing.If you feel like a date movie with a little romance, big laughs, witty dialogue, appealing characters and a spectacular location, this is not it... [an] embarrassment and an insult to audiences who might be conned into thinking it\\'s escapist fun.Mean, miserable married men. Not funny. A toddler easily steals the movie.nannannannannannannanWhat makes Knocked Up stand out is not just the fact that the jokes are side-splittingly funny but that nearly everything that happens to the couple rings so true. The very fact that some clearly juvenile filmmakers have hit on the truth that a baby in the womb is as much a life as the one cradled in its mother\\'s arms is encouraging.What really sells it is a fantastic support cast featuring Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill and Leslie Mann.... Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl have great chemistry onscreen and they are hysterical together.[Apatow] makes responsibility and commitment funny; no mean feat.What makes most of Knocked Up work is its ability to squeeze big laughs out of real-world situations.Knocked Up proves that hit comedy doesn\\'t have to dumb down for its demographic.With sparkling performances from Rogen and Heigl, Apatow once again shows his sharp eye for talent and continuing knack for hits.The jokes, which are in the absolute poorest taste, remain hilarious, while a newer, deeper humanism, sensed in momentary flashes in the earlier film, is now fully on display.The movie is a decisive breakthrough for Apatow, whose comic instincts go hand in hand with an unfashionable empathy.It\\'s a hysterical, well acted, and wonderful glimpse at impending parenthood from a man\\'s perspective...It\\'s a movie with heart and with balls, and it knows when to use each of them.If Apatow was seeking to make a film that\\'s smutty and funny, but also romantic and realistic about relationships, he\\'s succeeded admirably.Knocked Up is possibly the best comedy of the year.For all of its filthy tirades, Knocked Up is perhaps one of the more sentimental and honorable morality tales this year, featuring more educational value and entertainment than all of the after school specials in the world.There are also surprisingly few subplots for a movie that lasts more than two hours. What is on display, however, is very fertile stuff.Apatow\\'s cockeyed Citizen Kane, merging goofball, pothead jokes with a plausible story of unshakable relationship discomfort; a broad mismatch of personalities and body shapes glued together by the cruelty of insemination.Interesting blend of frat-house smarm and emotional incisivenessThe film seethes with misdirected and unrecognized anger.Knocked Up is like a Hallmark Greeting Card with crude verse. It\\'s is an uneasy mix of ethnic humor, slacker humor, and human drama -- some is amusing, some is indulgent, and some is strained.[A] very funny Peter Pan-and-Wendy- get-preggers story.A pleasant enough comedy that doesn\\'t take the \"gross out\" too far and presents a complex, if egotistical view of pregnancy and responsibility.Apatow simply knows funny when he sees it, and he gives his actors\\' ample opportunity to plumb all possible comic depths.Knocked Up really comes alive when it has something to say about the thorny responsibilities -- and unexpected blessings -- of adult relationships.For all its avowed interest in life -- as in, you know, the biological imperatives of our existence -- its characters seem acquainted only with television.Apatow\\'s talent for accurately portraying his generation at their most self-absorbed doesn\\'t quite go as far at justifying the script\\'s patchy, haphazard conflicts at it does toward explaining the film\\'s bloated running time.everything about it is greatThere is always something to smile about and identify with. If you\\'re a slacker, condescending or extremely hormonal this film has someone for you to worship.Somehow, some way, Apatow has crafted that rarest of gems -- equal parts heart and crass.Knocked Up is an instant classic, and cements Apatow\\'s status as the top comedic director in the businessStupidest and most overhyped piece of garbage since \"Little Miss SunshineRaunchy but tender comedy about sex and parenthood.A fun, relevant, raunchy and often hilarious movie.Although this story about a mismatched couple expecting a baby strains credibility and sometimes pushes the limits of good taste, it delivers plenty of belly laughs.I chuckled some; I smiled a lot.The professionally ambitious Alison and the unemployed slacker Ben are the ultimate odd couple, both likable though unsuited in every way.If Judd Apatow is going to set the gold standard for American screen comedy, it\\'s only natural to start expecting more.Apatow\\'s hardly the first filmmaker to go all gooshy on the subject of kids after becoming a father himself, but with his comic talent and flair for character, you\\'d think his movie would be more insightful about impending parenthood.It\\'s hard to deny the fact that, all this considered, it\\'s a work of art, even with that title.Now that he\\'s tackled the topic of sex, Apatow continues his exploration into the world of relationships with the next logical step -- pregnancy -- and in doing so, has created another cult classic.Maybe I\\'m being a little harsh on this movie, because there are a couple of funny scenes here and there, but they are so outweighed by the ones that bored me silly, they\\'re not the ones that I remember.It\\'s just too refreshing to see a well-made, genuinely funny comedy that is actually about something meaningful.Ultimately it\\'s a refreshing, amusing, and surprisingly touching comedy.A mostly funny, occasionally charming, steadily foul-mouthed, frequently well-written, otherwise downright stupid comedy, enjoyable in spite of its unaccountably overblown length of over two hours.Finally, a breath of fresh air arrives in the stale summer of sequels.Given that I like everyone involved, it is puzzling to me that I did not enjoy it, but such is life.You will recognize Ben Stone, in all his potheaded, work-fearing glory, and the laugh of recognition is surely the purest of all laughs.Extremely funny, well written and sharply observed comedy with strong comic performances from its talented cast.Funny, rude and with a heart of gold that surprisingly doesn\\'t grate.This is a rare thing - a comedy for both him and her.If the essence of great comedy is truth then Knocked Up falls some way short.Very funny for an hour, Judd Apatow\\'s script and direction are finally mugged by a gang worse than any of these.

The best rom-com in a long time.Knocked Up touches places most comedies wouldn\\'t dare, some of them scarily biological, some of them scarily accurate. It\\'s the sleeper hit of the summer, but don\\'t worry: it\\'s much better than that.There\\'s no doubt director/writer Apatow is supplying a national service by allowing the inept to feel adequate about themselves.As with the best comedies, the film mines its laughs from recognizable human traits.

I was prepared for an offensive natured film, but I was very surprised. This film was clean and had taste.Knocked Up\" is one hilarious moment on top of another...[Apatow] sees love as something that can slip in the back door when the front door is barricaded by common sense.The movie gets a lot of mileage from the boys\\' bonding over shared fears, frustrations, and yearnings.It is hilarious, heartwarming and an absolute delight from beginning to end.It is not easy to walk that tightrope between clever, witty, insightful humor and bawdy farce, but Apatow seems to walk it with ease.Knocked Up isn\\'t going to help change the world or anything, but at the very least it may help take one\\'s mind off the relentlessly dismal headlines. I don\\'t know what greater service a mere movie can perform these days.Engagingly raunchy, but strip Apatow\\'s films of their vulgarity and they\\'d warm the heart of a Production Code censor from a half century ago.The film simply can\\'t and doesn\\'t live up to the lofty expectations created by its \"Virgin\" predecessor.Brush aside the crude formula and bathroom humor and you\\'ve got yourself a surprisingly delicate social commentary.Not only is it hysterically funny, but it\\'s refreshing to see a movie about adults that\\'s not dumbed down for kids.Knocked Up is an ambient, funny movie more devoted to enjoying the journey of its characters\\' world than it is bothered with its destination.An unlikely but likable comedy, bigger on sweetness than it is on belly laughs.As observational satire, it lacks the outcast verve that comes with real outrage.One of the best scenes in the film belongs to Harold Ramis as Ben\\'s dad. When Ben goes to his father with concerns about his own impending fatherhood, the two share a lovely heart to heart.With equal measures of raunch and sentimentality, Knocked Up explores the minefield of imminent parenthood for two people who don\\'t know each other very well.Although I loved this movie, I\\'m getting tired of the King of Queens world where attractive, capable women fall in love with/end up mothering shlubby, childish men.It\\'s all about pushing the envelope and scoring one for less attractive, socially awkward males.Its best and worst attribute is how nice it is.Apatow\\'s ability to wring laughs both large and small out of ordinary situations is enviable.A hilarious family values flick which manages to convince you that it\\'s possible to transform a misogynist into a doting father on the guilt of an unplanned pregnancy.Run out and see this baby.A refreshingly frank, funny odd-couple comedy with engaging leads and too many belly laughs to count.Knocked Up is a knockout.... a genuine honesty and realism that lets R-rated hilarity ensue from the truth instead of mere spectacle.Follows the standard crude romantic comedy formula, but it does so with remarkable intelligence.

This is a picture that refuses to fetishize either the ability to conceive or the significance of our place in the universe once we\\'ve done so.There\\'s value in films about supernatural heroes and bigger-than-life villains, but the ones that stick with us feature characters we can relate to. Apatow has given birth to that sort of film, and he should be a very proud papa.What makes the movie so winning are its endearing and relatable characters who spout believable dialogue and amusing banter, steeped in clever pop-culture references and sharp observations of human nature.Beginning at the end of the traditional meet-court-marry-impregnate chain of romantic events, Apatow\\'s clever comedy is a romance in reverse, and it works.Knocked Up is a different kind of movie, a refreshing mix of the whip smart and the heartfelt.One of the raunchiest, dirtiest, most hilarious movies in recent memory and, hands down, the best American comedy of the year so far.It\\'s hard enough to find comedies like this at any time, so it\\'s a small and welcome miracle to come upon one in the midst of a typical movie summer, richer than ever in over-budgeted, underwhelming inanities.Apatow shows how a comedy should and can be more like life, without sacrificing a laugh.It\\'s what makes Apatow\\'s comedies so interesting: old-fashioned notions of love and commitment, delivered with honesty and without too much sentiment, decorated with a contemporary taste for the vulgar.Apatow has a gift for earthy, snarky humor and for making heroes of the lamest of doofuses. His wit is sharp, his feel for a wide range of characters is deep, and his ability to coax random hilarity out of an improvising cast is precious and rare.Knocked Up is a knockout.Apatow\\'s dialogue is so good, the undercurrent of his story so inherently sweet, and the performances so engaging, that you surrender immediately.Something about its portrait of the battle between men and women rings familiar and true, and it has a sweetness and innocence that elevates the best of the genre.[C]elebrat[es] as charming and inevitable and amusing and sweet what anyone who is that apparently rare specimen -- an actual, genuine grownup -- should be decrying as deplorable.What ultimately makes the film so satisfying is the seriousness and affection with which Apatow treats his characters, no matter how drug-addled or misguided they may be.I\\'m not saying this is a John Cassavetes film or anything, but the movie\\'s ability to uncork one great line after another that evokes both a laugh and an uncomfortable feeling of recognition is masterful.It\\'s the Sideways of the Something About Mary subgenre, a raunchy cartoon laughfest that takes its emotional issues dead seriously.As he did with Virgin, Apatow here pulls off the not inconsiderable feat of making the crude seem somehow endearing. There\\'s something in the Apatow style that makes palatable material that in the hands of other directors would be tasteless.Already a hilarious filmmaker, Judd Apatow is maturing into an emotionally resonant storyteller.While Apatow\\'s movie isn\\'t perfect, it\\'s still a fumbling and funny valentine to the shock of pregnancy, the reality of love and the chaos of all that comes after.Look at what else is playing in multiplexes across North America at the moment and, if you can find a film that entertains and touches as effectively, give us a call.Knocked Up is full of huge laughs and witty pop culture banter but also offers insightful and honest explorations of marriage, relationships, friendship and parenthood.Even if it goes on past full-term, it never seems like labor: more like a big bungle of joy.It\\'s a very simple movie that ends up making room for some invitingly complex ideas.Knocked Up is half goofball guy-movie and half sentimental chick-flick, and it works on both levels, even if it does overstay its welcome.[Helmer] Apatow and company\\'s latest endeavor has a lot going for it, including heart and intelligence.Blisteringly hilarious from start to finish, a relationship comedy built on sturdy emotional conflict and not a series of flimsy gags.Here is a movie loaded with raunchy jokes about premarital sex and getting stoned that is not just soda-out-the-nose funny but also one of the most life-affirming and pro-marriage movies ever made.Knocked Up has a really surprising sweetness to it amidst some truly raunchy jokes.Knocked Up\" has an elegance of form, a generosity of spirit and a mad determination to take things too far - and then farther -that approaches comic perfection. And in the end achieves it.Takes a worn-out plot and give it a surprisingly warm and fuzzy, yet very R-rated face lift.The situations are so painful sometimes that its almost as if Apatow sat down and made a list of the things that create friction between men and women and then wrote a script around that.A sex comedy with a large heart and a generous spirit, Judd Apatow\\'s Knocked Up is a thrilling piece of work - a character-driven story rooted in adult reality that\\'s the funniest film since, uh, what? Maybe ... ever....suffers from an aimless, overlong sort of vibe that often threatens to negate its many positive attributes....the latest movie in one of the odder hybrid genres: the cross between the romantic comedy and the gross-out fratboy farce.[Apatow] dampens any impending slapstick with his brilliant, deceptively ragged dialogue; the situations live and breathe via his finely tuned talk.Judd Apatow is making comedies but also wants to tell relationship stories and get more serious at times, for better or worse.[Apatow] makes these basic situations as humane and as funny as you\\'d expect, and he makes it look effortless.A very lovable and witty comedy that should be a welcome friend in this sequel-heavy summer.Marks a more mature worldview and understanding of relationships from [Apatow\\'s] last film.You can\\'t go wrong with Knocked Up if you just want to laugh, and feel a bit dirty about it later.Not only does the film treat its characters with respect and without condescension, it does so even when their actions border on the indefensible.It may be a bit, um, premature to say so, but Judd Apatow\\'s Knocked Up strikes me as an instant classic, a comedy that captures the sexual confusion and moral ambivalence of our moment.Either an act of subversive genius or a strangely conservative scolding in the guise of a dumb comedy.Apatow knows growing up is a rough patch of grass but he wants to understand it. Such lofty ambitions seem to have been largely banished from romantic comedies, but here, it gives Knocked Up an honest timelessness.An attitude bazooka full of sex, drugs and raw language, yet so high on babies and family values that this must be the first R-rated film for both sleazoid slackers and earnest right-to-lifers.Apatow has an original wit and golden touch that seems to cry out for more sophisticated material: It will be very interesting to see what he does with the free rein that the enormous box-office success of this movie is likely to bring him.It\\'s not that Knocked Up is misogynistic -- if anything, Apatow is uxorious to a fault, scrupulously respectful of chicks and the chick stuff they do. He just doesn\\'t seem to get exactly what that stuff is.Apatow\\'s marriage of guyville and girlworld is not one made in heaven -- he\\'s too pragmatic to observe the rom-com conventions. What\\'s potent about Knocked Up is its down-to-earthiness.Apatow\\'s gleefully raunchy movies are, in an odd and charming way, extremely family-friendly.I doubt you\\'ll see a funnier movie this summer than Knocked Up.

Knocked Up proves that the nine-month ride can also be pretty damn fun, too.While Seth Rogen\\'s no Steve Carell, he\\'s perfect for Knocked Up: Both the star and the movie are flabby, immature and almost always funny.If you want to hate on Judd Apatow\\'s Knocked Up -- and the anti-crowd-pleaser contingent will surely ding it -- then get ready to be drowned out by the sound of laughter from the rest of us.Unlike so many comedies that rely on plastic characters based on no one from this universe, Apatow studies society and what truly makes us laugh -- which often turns out to be ourselves.Knocked Up has more heart than any of the Hollywood blockbusters released so far this year ... combined.Knocked Up is so enamored of Ben and his insouciant charm that it fails to wonder what it must feel like for the girl.Knocked Up is a good film.

It\\'s the relationship comedy of the summer and likely the best boy-meets-girl movie of the year.An uproariously frank treatment of pregnancy and adulthood. Movies about family chaos are generally the province of PG-rated Steve Martin comedies, which makes the raw candor of Apatow\\'s film not only refreshing, but more honest in its sentiment.Like most of Apatow\\'s work, Knocked Up walks a perilous line between sarcasm and sentimentality, and though it\\'s extremely funny in bursts, the movie flirts once too often with schmaltz before toppling into melodrama in its third act.Good as a nutty anthropology of marginal living and as an illustration of how much energy it takes to do nothing in a work-obsessed society.Finds humor and pathos in sex, friendship, relationships and the relentless process of growing up.Has some sporadic laughs, but Ben and especially his roommates are just too gross to be the kind of charming free spirits Apatow thinks they are.Judd Apatow makes me want to be a dude.A film that manages to be uncommonly thoughtful and sensitive to the complexity of its very faulted characters while still being relentlessly, brilliantly funny.Uproarious.

Other filmmakers embarking into the comedy minefield could learn a thing or two from him. He\\'s two for two.Lewd, crude and straight from the heart...It\\'s a sincere meditation on adulthood, accountability, and fidelity -- and, yeah, getting high.a winning combination of wit, physical humor and bawdy sight gags.Knocked Up feels very now. The banter is bruisingly funny, the characters brilliantly childish, the portrait of our culture\\'s narrowing gap between children and their elders hysterical -- in all senses.Because its central character is a meticulously architected dude, Knocked Up is a contrived male fantasy.Dabbles in the improbable loony male-driven fantasy of flabby slacker sex appeal, while taking pot shots at the snobbery of upwardly mobile gorgeous women who wouldn\\'t give them a second look in actual life.Judd Apatow\\'s raunchy and realistic look at sex, marriage and responsible parenting is one of the most consistently funny movies of the year.Relatability is certainly a key component of Knocked Up\\'s inherent appeal.A mega-laugh comedy about the messiness of change with lovable characters whose humor and flawed humanity make them very appealing.You expect it to be crude, rude, profane and hilariously vulgar - and it doesn\\'t disappoint.Though some, including the filmmakers, might find this sort of material smart and real, others might consider it middlebrow and not particularly representative of the complex and interesting people they know, some of whom are even men.What do I already know after just one screening? That this belongs on the short list of the best comedies of the last twenty years.Filled with real characters, great pop culture references, foul-mouthed jokes and with a gooey sweetness right at the center, Knocked Up is a comedy classic.I wondered why there aren\\'t more films -- especially comedies -- this sharp, this clever, this good.It\\'s not just about growing up, it\\'s the kind of movie that helps you grow up.Knocked Up is uproarious. Line for line, minute to minute, writer-director Judd Apatow\\'s latest effort is more explosively funny, more frequently, than nearly any other major studio release in recent memory.nanIts plump chickens maintain that strange, haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them.Even without Wallace and Gromit, most of the trademark joys are here: the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery, the wide, open-ended rictus of a toothy smile, and the great Parkian gulp.It coaxes you to laugh and cry, flatters your intelligence, and practically guarantees a cheap night out: at dinner afterward, no one\\'s going to be ordering anything but salad.It\\'s a warm-hearted and amusing entertainment that your children will enjoy.Chickens are inherently funny, like nature\\'s idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans.Chicken Run is a charmingly conceived entertainment. But it\\'s a little bit twee.What gives this movie its oddly strong grip on a viewer\\'s heart is a physical tenderness inseparable from the nature of claymation.The claymation comedy Chicken Run is eggsactly what the doctor ordered.

It\\'s as if the clay figures kids make have managed to take on a life of their own.This first feature by Nick Park and Peter Lord, the team that brought you Wallace and Gromit, is a diabolically witty piece of work, a haymaker.Most of the laughs stem from the peculiar appeal of claymation -- something about a raised eyebrow or other subtle bit of expression just seems funnier at the stop-motion speed of claymation.Apart from looking like no other type of animated film, Chicken Run stands alone in its unwavering determination not to play down to the kiddies.Chicken Run isn\\'t just chock-full of references to classic prison-break movies and some witty inside Hollywood jokes, but is filled with a secret ingredient sadly missing from its super-digitized, merchandise-driven counterparts: heart.Chicken Run, Aardman\\'s first full-length animated feature, finally makes good on the promise of the studio\\'s award-winning shorts.It is not only an amazing technical accomplishment, it\\'s also the wittiest and best-voiced animated movie to come along in years.Chicken Run boasts the most delicious collection of desperately funny Brits since The Full Monty.

When it comes to clever and fun entertainment with a twist, it\\'s the cock of the walk.The sophisticated humor of Peter Lord and Nick Park\\'s very funny comedy is more likely to strike a nerve with adults.Thoroughly endearing family entertainment.Exactly the picker-upper this macho-movie summer needs.Park\\'s love for all his characters, good and evil, is literally palpable: These characters have been forged of clay, fussed over, posed, photographed over a period of years.That rare animated film that can easily please all age groups.It\\'d be churlish to carp about this triumph of craftsmanlike technique.I know I\\'ve seen a good funny animal movie if I stop eating the animal in real life.Inventiveness taken to new levels...simply a marvel.I don\\'t think two minutes went by where I wasn\\'t laughing out loud.It has intelligence, humor, drama and tragedy, dance numbers, amour and more, any of which will have appeal to someone out there.It\\'s a wonder to know that each frame of this film was handmade, not orchestrated by a computer.Insufferably twee.Something about Nick Park\\'s characters is intrinsically hilarious... Maybe it\\'s those teeth.A sharp, witty movie that finally answers the age-old question: what do chickens do when you\\'re not looking?It\\'s hard to make bits of clay flutter like feathers, but somehow they do.The lavish coops, detailed pie machine and realistic lighting are just a small thread in a beautiful canvas of stirring images.The poultry cast are capable of an extraordinary range of expression, especially during the sad or mildly scary scenes.I highly recommend you check this out on the big screen. The deeply ironic undertones will keep adults and kids entertained alike.Full of humor for every age group, capped off with the message that perseverance and teamwork pay off.What really makes it special, more than the impressive animation, is the endearing characters and involving plot.Filled with heroism, humor and heart, this wonderful film is a treat for the entire family.Like the computer animators at Pixar, the stop-motion wizards at Aardman realize their technical prowess would be wasted without a worthy script.Gets by on the elements of fun and frivolity common to all the Aardman animations.Apresenta um visual arrebatador.May not maintain quite the same frantic level of invention as the Wallace and Gromit shorts, but it has more heart.Fans of the more subversive Wallace and Gromit tales are almost bound to be somewhat disappointed by this safer, more mainstream effort.Clever, funny and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.Fowl by no means, this film is no feather in the cap, either.In short: It\\'s everything you could hope for from an Aardman feature.Chicken Run Movie Review Pure poultry.The real magic of Chicken Run is how personable it is, how easy and effortlessly it tells its story.There are last minute rescues and incredible visuals.For adults, it can get mushy and repetitious, though the overall sweetness and ingenuity shoveled into it makes you want to love the movie more than you\\'re able.When Mel Gibson passes on to that big screen in the sky, don\\'t be surprised if he\\'s best remembered for playing a flirtatious rooster.mostly good, lighthearted entertainment with more than its share of bad chicken punsChicken Run is one of those movies that plays well to children, but also has plenty of dry jokes that will keep adults entertained as well.Playful, infectious, and totally extraordinary.Oh, Chicken Run is a good movie, no doubt.

Now, imagine Mel Gibson in feathers.Does the Nick Park charm work for a feature film? In my opinion, not really.Chicken Run should be seen by the whole family. Actually, it should be seen by everyone.One of the most entertaining vehicles of the year.It\\'s an entertaining warm-up, a few bits of brilliance packed in disposable kiddie fluff.nannanDirector David Yates deals with this change of tone skillfully.Director Chris Columbus has pushed the envelope farther, made a sequel that is pacier and more swashbuckling. Yet it still feels cautious and reined-in.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is darker, funnier and finer than its forerunner Harry Potter and the Philosopher\\'s Stone.Chamber Of Secrets is funnier and more exciting than the first Harry Potter movie, and adorned with some of the most stunning special effects ever.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets isn\\'t perfect, but it\\'s everything it should be: fun, exciting, humorous and stirring.Have no fear, you legions of Potter fans: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a solid step forward in the movie adaptations of J.K. Rowling\\'s much-read novels.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is good enough to satisfy hard-core fans, even if it falls short of being truly transporting moviemaking.Columbus\\' pacing is still murderously slow, his ideas as pedestrian as the worst TV.Despite its sophomoric awkwardness, the Chamber of Secrets is a welcome delivery of childlike wonder for a planet of ever- increasing ugliness.Although it\\'s unlikely to make converts of the uninitiated, fans of the series and its characters will find the movie to be a worthy entry.It appears that the production has learned from its mistakes and managed to put together the kind of film that deserves to be a part of young adult film folklore for generations to come.This new Harry Potter has its flaws, but it\\'s better, as well as darker, than the first.Two down, presumably five to go, and already the franchise is entering dangerous territory: if you aren\\'t one of the many who know their Harry Potter chapter and verse, prepare for a nap.Columbus carefully avoids overly replaying the visual wonders of his first episode, and heedfully edits and amplifies Rowling\\'s story for the screen, preserving its spooky darkness.Better story, better acting, better characters and better effects. All they need is to sort out the dialogue next time, and everyone\\'s a winner.The three main child actors, including Emma Watson as Hermione, have gained in confidence and grown nicely into their roles and all of the regular ensemble from the first film return.It doesn\\'t help that Chamber is pretty much all business from the opening shot, trading in Stone\\'s sometimes-clunky exposition for full-steam-ahead action.A good entertaining film with a lot of imagination...Possibly second only to Goblet of Fire of all the Potter films to date, Chamber of Secrets should please fans and muggles alike.Those who adore the books may bemoan the flat emotional landscape of the films, which are less easy to engage with. Fans of the first film will be suitably entertained.Like many children I\\'ve met, director Chris Columbus seems never to have heard the word no.Scary spiders, impressive effects and a barnstorming Branagh add pizzazz to Potter.Action- and creature-packed Potter sequel.Everything about The Sorcerer\\'s Stone pretty much applies to the adaptation of the second novel in the series.Allow yourself the luxury of discovering this enchanted world for yourself.The exciting second chapter in the Harry Potter chronicle that in many ways surpasses the original.Though these films are trifles, they are at least high quality trifles.May just be the most quintessential Steven Spielberg movie Steven Spielberg never made.This second effort is even better than the first go around.An enjoyable sequel.It\\'s good enough that I might just start taking an interest in the books after all.Back is Chris Columbus, whose direction this time around has a purposely darker, more ominous look.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, satisfies as a film adaptation, but it doesn\\'t cast as enchanting a spell as the first movie.The second film to spring forth from J.K. Rowling\\'s popular series of children\\'s books goes a long way towards amping up the dramatic tension promised by the source material.This is as rousing and faithful an adaptation as was possible.It\\'s a depressing reality to face, but the second of J.K. Rowling\\'s boy-wizard books was the least interesting read... and hasn\\'t fared much better on film.The franchise is showing no fear at exploring the novels\\' darker moments, but needs to judiciously pare down the time it takes for the lights to come up.Blood is splattered on walls, pre-teen students are turned to stone, a Poltergeist-ian tree tries to smash our heroes, spiders rampage across the Dark Forest and a giant snake cruises menacingly through dank catacombs.The humor and the villainy have bite, the acting has conviction, the effects look far less cheesy, and the storytelling actually conveys the imagination and emotional power of Rowling\\'s prose.Before it degenerates into Indiana Potter and the Chamber of Doom, the movie holds promise.Punishingly long and slow in parts.Director Chris Columbus and company have done a stand-out job of capturing the imagination if not the detail of those books....provides wondrous surprises around every turn.I still don\\'t understand how J.K. Rowling could have made such obscene gobs of cash off of such a simple and overwrought premise ... I\\'ll stick with LORD OF THE RINGSAn effort that is full of gosh-wow moments.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets surpasses Sorcerer\\'s Stone as a crisper, more action-packed film, which will more than thrill the billions of Harry Potter fans everywhere.It\\'s fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn\\'t feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark.No less magical, no less engaging, and no less kid-pleasing than its record-breaking predecessor. It\\'s also no shorter...Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets works the kind of magic that Hollywood rarely displays: It\\'s a sequel that\\'s better than the original.Represents a lost opportunity to give children, not to mention adults, a movie experience that would widen their eyes as the justly beloved Rowling books did.An enchanting spectacular for Potter fans anxious to ride the Hogwarts Express toward a new year of magic and mischief.This film is basically one big Scooby Doo episode.Offers a more imaginatively colourful world than almost every other children\\'s film out there.... the script is tight enough and moves along with such blazing speed that it suffers from the only failing grace of the original did: can audience members who haven\\'t read the books keep up?The Chamber of Secrets,\" while more visually striking and entertaining, still suffers from many of the same problems that plagued \"The Sorcerer\\'s Stone.One of those rare sequels that is as good as the original movie.How desperate is Columbus if his creepy spiders look, act, and sound just like the Eight Legged FreaksSequentially and tonally, it\\'s so derivative of the last movie that it not only fails to build upon its predecessor, it\\'s stuck covering the very same ground.Slick and sophisticated, if same-y.Where the first film was the exposition, the follow-up is the reward - taking our heroes on a darker, more rewarding journey as we watch them deepen and mature with time.A rich and rewarding family entertainment experience that teens and adults will thoroughly enjoy more -- as will the kids.The film is muddled by its slavish dedication to the minutiae of events and at the same time, erases those aspects of the book that gave it real social and political urgency.Lots of fun and action, laughs and mystery, and really, isn?t that why we love Harry Potter? Branagh brilliant.I stopped thinking about how good it all was, and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations, thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled, feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness, gasping at its visual delights.After struggling interminably to bring the first of the obscenely popular Harry Potter novels to the screen, director Chris Columbus finally cracks the code with his second effort.Unnecessarily lengthy and repetitious, but still has a certain charm that can offer entertainment for both children and adults.This second succulent serving of Harry Potter may be all over the map like a feeble-minded person looking for interstate highway directions, but it does lend itself to do what it\\'s suppose to do...whisk diehard moviegoers away to another dynamic dimensionChris Columbus\\' shortcomings in ingenuity and imagination don\\'t seem terribly detrimental since the material he\\'s working with is so infused with magic and witDirector Chris Columbus has made a darker, quicker movie of it than he did of The Sorcerer\\'s Stone, with particularly fine settings and atmosphere.In all fairness, I must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed, fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks.Desta vez, Columbus capturou o pomo de ouro.Like the first \"Pott-ah\" movie, the scenery was amazing and the music was great. Throw in the story that everybody loves and these movies really have the whole package.The special effects enchant all -- no matter what your age.The magic of the books seems to be having trouble making the transition to big screen.Though the lack of nuance is regrettable, there\\'s much to enjoy.Grab a broomstick and sail along for the ride.In fact, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is darker than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, slightly, especially in its sideways engaging of race prejudice.This is a vastly superior movie, capturing all the things that I felt were missing from the first.Made so well that all ages can appreciate it.Snappier than the first.The second chapter of the Harry Potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year.Doing away with the formalities helps Chamber of Secrets immensely, allowing it to concentrate on unfolding its involving mystery, using the running time to pace the action and the development.Simply put, if you liked Sorcerer\\'s Stone, you\\'ll like Chamber Of Secrets.Contains little of the first film\\'s exciting fantasy appeal....an imaginative, often entertaining journey into self-realization that\\'s well worth the trip.These Potter kids have grown up a lot in one year. At this rate, their next adventure will be Harry Potter and the Octogenarian\\'s Enlarged Prostate.Now that\\'s more like it.Where Chamber of Secrets will be viewed a success is in accurately, and occasionally imaginatively, bringing the book to life. As a movie, judged on its own merits, it\\'s too long, too slow and too unfocused.This overlong sequel is short of magic.Progress was made in all departments, despite an apocalyptic occurrence that looked likely to close Hogwarts for ever.Not great, but worth seeing.Terrific fun, a sequel with more self-assurance than most original films can muster.A pretty wondrous creation.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a solid work; it\\'s effortlessly entertaining, generously faithful to J.K. Rowling\\'s book -- and thrilling.Most viewers, especially the younger ones, will reap its joys.Big, dull and empty.Just as there is more magic conjured up in Chamber of Secrets the book, Chamber of Secrets the movie weaves a more powerful spell over its audience.Chris Columbus makes the novel\\'s transformation into a big-budget feature look effortless, and the film\\'s darker tone is more satisfying than that of the first, a somewhat forced happy ending notwithstanding.Much of what made the first film so enchanting remains firmly in place, from the strong ensemble performances through Stuart Craig\\'s magnificent production design.The best blend of human activity with computer animation since \\'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\'This time out, director Chris Columbus waves his wand in all the right directions. The funny scenes are funnier. The scary scenes are scarier.Just as often the film is as monotonous and despair-inducing as three hours on an airplane with nothing to read but the in-flight magazine.The result is better than The Sorcerer\\'s Stone, but still feels slightly bloated and unfocused.The Godfather II of family films.Once again, director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours.The magic still sparkles in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Doesn\\'t dally around and far more action-packed than the first.A lot more nimble than the first movie.The whole Harry Potter thing may not be as fresh for moviegoers as it was last year, but thankfully Chamber of Secrets is well-crafted.Secrets is pretty much a wash with the first Potter movie: not much in the way of captivating magic, but all the expected notes are duly played.It\\'s a fun flick, even though its wizardry is more technical than imaginative.While it still falls short of becoming the classic fans so badly want it to be, the film is livelier and better overall than The Sorcerer\\'s Stone, mostly because J.K. Rowling got all that tiresome exposition over with the first time out.Although very much like the first movie based on J.K. Rowling\\'s phenomenal fantasy best sellers, this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing, headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude.There are enough pleasures here to guarantee a diverting time to all but the most curmudgeonly Muggles.Darker, scarier, funnier and more fun-filled.The film is quite lengthy, but so brisk and busy at all times that it quite flies by.This movie, like the first, is more of a translation than an adaptation. It\\'s the visual equivalent of an audio book, slightly abridged.This is a critic-proof film. How nice that it doesn\\'t need to be in order to succeed.Dark, resonant, inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement.So-so entertainment.Not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved, and Daniel Radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as Harry, but the film conjures the magic of author J.K. Rowling\\'s books.The weakest of the four Harry Potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins.Entertaining and moves nimbly enough to keep your way-back seat from turning to stone.Just as Harry and friends are fighting the forces of darkness, the film\\'s great elements are struggling toward the spotlight.It\\'s, well, spellbinding.If you were like me and didn\\'t particularly care for the first installment, I don\\'t think this one will completely reverse your opinion.Where \"Stone\" was a pretty bauble all dressed up with nowhere to emote, \"Secrets\" is a genuinely scary sequel that remembers to bring its heart along, too. Scratch that. It brings its guts.It\\'s not always lovelier the second time around, but still, this \"Harry\" shows some magic when neededThe special effects and CGI, uneven in Sorcerer\\'s Stone, are all spit-shine and shoe-polish in Chamber of Secrets. There isn\\'t one hair out of place.Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans. But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm, this is the opposite of a truly magical movie.It\\'s still easy to fall for this sorcerer\\'s spell.I can\\'t think of a movie this long that has left me so starved for a movie.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superior to its predecessor in every way: It\\'s more thrilling, more entertaining and, yep, more magical.Two-and-a-half hours of unadulterated fun.The kids will be just as wild about Harry the second time around, but adults had better be ready to take the multiple-choice quiz in advance.Overall, the movie feels brighter, smarter and sleeker than the first.As a companion piece to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets makes for effective viewing.Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling\\'s marvelous series into a deadly bore.The first movie was the setup, and this one is the payoff.Despite a potpourri of minor delights, the film ends up a disappointment.The Chamber of Secrets may not be a classic, but it\\'s more eventful than its predecessor.Chamber of Secrets is not quite the magical mystery tour that the first one was. Despite some major improvements, the movie is often sluggish in pacing and intrigue.The continuing story of everyone\\'s favorite boy wizard is a visual feast -- and darker than the first installment.Returns the original\\'s cast and director, and retains that film\\'s winning combination of limitless imagination and exhilarating adventure.Swims in mediocrity, sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then.When it comes to the imagination scale, Harry Potter has everything it needs. But what does it all really amount to in the end? Not much of a payoff, I\\'m afraid.As with the original film, there\\'s little to offend the most myopic fan of the books, but also little room for the imaginative extension of the author\\'s universe that distinguishes an inspired adaptation from a merely workmanlike one.It captures all the magic, mystery, excitement and wonder from J.K. Rowling\\'s book in a way that plays extremely well on screen.Bigger, faster, funnier, and darker...[but] lacks the deep soul and character nuances of its predecessor.It\\'s good, genuinely good, not just as a cultural sensation but as a movie all its own.About on par with the first from a pure entertainment standpoint.A little better than Sorcerer\\'s Stone.If you liked one, you\\'ll like the otherLike the first film, it cleaves too faithfully to the source material, but it always fills the screen with spectacle.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again, and while that is a cliche, nothing could be more appropriate. It\\'s likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you\\'ll likely think of this one.As The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars, so Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is to last year\\'s freshman introduction. In short, it\\'s bigger and better.If the kids are more serious in their play this time around, then the grownups are just having a blast.Whisks us away for more adventures that keep us on the edge of our seats cheering for these three young wizards whose resourcefulness in the face of the unknown is awesome.Deepening and widening an imaginative world full of cleverly detailed creatures, much as J.K. Rowling has done in her books, Chamber is a speedy, funny winner.Faster-paced and more chock-full of adventure than the original.It\\'s smartly produced and slightly more streamlined than Sorcerer\\'s Stone, its predecessor, but at almost three hours it\\'s still too slavishly faithful to its source and will no doubt try the patience of Muggle moppets.In his second year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the cinematic Harry Potter shows improvement. But he has a ways to go before earning top marks.From screaming mandrake plants to animal transfiguration to ethereal letters literally hanging in the air, [Columbus\\'] approach to the books\\' enchanting elements is marvelous to behold.Darker, scarier and somewhat better than Sorcerer\\'s Stone.Ironically enough, Chamber of Secrets has more of a narrative arc, but consequently lacks much urgency. It does retain the wonderment that made the first film fun.Chris Columbus\\' sequel is faster, livelier and a good deal funnier than his original.Once again the production values -- the sets, costumes and props -- are pure perfection.It remains an expertly assembled companion piece to its source material, with charms you can\\'t overlook. But the great Harry Potter should be casting a more powerful spell.Even though Chamber of Secrets is a vast improvement, Columbus\\' directorial touch remains more caring than inspired.Proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books, they can\\'t go wrong. Better effects, better acting and a hilarious Kenneth Branagh. An excellent sequel.Mercilessly padded, the movie drags us through ages of all-too-familiar territory.There\\'s just enough of the old to feel at home and provide continuity, just enough of the new to keep things fresh.The series has progressed from reciting J.K. Rowling\\'s source novels to paraphrasing them.When it was all over, I could easily proclaim The Chamber of Secrets as a vastly superior film on every level, one that I\\'ll be willing to devote more time to again and again in the future.Exactly what you\\'d expect from a movie that features a self-mutilating house elf.All the things that made the first film a hit with its target audience.Columbus overcomes several of the first film\\'s problems with this much darker, slightly more edgy sequel.It nearly overwhelms its own inherent magical wonders and characters with an emphasis on action, but the movie also manages to work its way out from under the heavy hallowed aura that partially smothered the fun of its predecessor.Their thoughts were how to make the book into a movie, not how to make a great movie.Kids will have nightmares for weeks and adults will be entertained for hours...An improvement on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone.More dutiful than enchanting...terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat.Exactly the kind of slam-bang adventure that\\'s certain to please audiences of all ages.For the time being, the Harry Potter thrill ride is whizzing along very satisfactorily indeed.Chamber of Secrets is fairly fun despite its length.Another successful wild ride, thanks to a very entertaining source, a keen and fairly faithful adaptation, and top-notch special effects.A vast improvement over last year\\'s film, bloated as it was with Quidditch matches and monster moments that didn\\'t advance the plot one iota.That the film is a worthy swan song for Richard Harris is first a surprise then an incalculable relief--and destined to be the proudest legacy of the picture: a beautifully crafted dark fable.Chamber\\'s charm lies in the sheer visualization of Rowling\\'s weirder inventions.This time, the hype is quieter, and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first, it\\'s still a rollicking good time for the most part.This one does for the series what The Wrath of Khan did for Star Trek.A watered-down, CG-saturated nod to moviemaking convention.Lots more of the same isn\\'t better.Harry\\'s latest adventure has enough snakes, mandrakes, phoenix tears, Cornish pixies, climaxes and denouements to scare the J.R.R. Tolkien out of you.A good sequel and should please all the Potter fans who made the first film a blockbuster.The second installment is scarier, darker, longer and even better than the first. It\\'s an enchanting, enthralling, eye-popping miracle of moviemaking.Without the newness of the first film to give it some electricity, this Harry Potter outing comes off as harmless but flat.Once again, Chris Columbus stays out of J.K. Rowling\\'s way, sticking to the text and hitting each narrative beat cleanly and vigorously.Chris Columbus, the director, does a real wonderful job of being faithful to the story but also taking it into a cinematic era.Incredibly, once again, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus deliver a movie without passion.The special effects here will have you reclining in your seat, admiring the spectacle. Unfortunately, the film\\'s pedestrian pacing won\\'t get you on the edge of it.It is on every count a better movie than last year\\'s first film installment.The sense of discovery, that initial encounter with the stories\\' vivid characters and whimsical parallel universe, is missing. In its stead comes frantic activity.Boy wizard and his faithful friends battle evil in a magical boarding school. You know, like last time.Gives Columbus the chance to indulge himself with fascinatingly realistic special effects and riveting action sequences.Mostly fun, somewhat enchanting, and at a few turns -- surprisingly spooky.nanScenes that should have been uproarious are weaker than many of the movie\\'s smaller moments, whose everyday humor isn\\'t specific to the plot or characters.Star-driven comedy at times offensive and funny....large swaths of the proceedings feel as though they\\'d be more at home within a garden-variety sitcom.What gives the film its special kick is the match of Stiller and De Niro.Nobody plays put-upon quite like Ben Stiller.Alas, poor Focker. He can\\'t help himself. And we can\\'t help ourselves from falling about, equally helpless, at this superbly antic movie.Packed with cringe-worthy moments from beginning to end, Jay Roach\\'s comedy is for anyone who has ever endured a weekend in the company of potential in-laws.Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers films keeps the pace brisk, and the script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high.Stiller portrays a human accident better than anyone and he definitely knows how to extort laughs and sympathy from his audienceContains enough belly-laughs and sly jokes to become one of the bigger crowd-pleasers of the fall.Astutely observed, subtly played and consistently hilarious...Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffes.A definite must-see that\\'s perfect for a guys\\' night out or a relaxing date.An entertaining little outing, but not something that will stay with me.Does the usual Hollywood bit of setting up the gags way in advance so that even a coma patient can spot them.As far as one-joke movies go, this one has its guffaws.Stiller plays a familiar character with a nice energy and presence, making the most of all his character\\'s asides and observations.Guaranteed to put you off suggested Sunday outings for life.This film is almost too real to be funny. It is one uncomfortable moment after another - and that is what Stiller does best, but director Roach would have done well to tone it down a bit.Stiller has a gift for looking funny effortlessly, when he\\'s doing nothing physical. With no mugging, no physical contortions, he turns his face into a palette of pain and confusion.What saves the movie from remaining an exercise in self-parody for all involved is director Roach\\'s feel for the material.This is, unquestionably, the best comedy currently on release. Highly recommended.Great filmmaking this is not, but if you\\'re looking for an amusing, undemanding couple of hours, give this a try.Overbearingly cruel and only modestly funny.This simple but well-constructed comedy picks a situation that naturally causes anxiety - meeting your in-laws - and turns it into a walk through hell.I\\'m eagerly awaiting a sequel.Too many actors make the error of thinking that being funny involves lots of hysteria and hyperactivity, but De Niro knows that good comic acting is no different than good dramatics: The performance must be grounded in truth.Consistently more fun than it has any right to be, Meet the Parents is an example of how sometimes it really is all about casting the right couple of stars.This truth doesn\\'t hurt as much as the infamous franks-and-beans scene from There\\'s Something About Mary, but the pain and the laughter last longer.When the script puts its faith in the audience, allowing us to find the laughs on our own, the film is irresistible, a bright lark. Yet when the writers panic, upping the antic volume and shifting into crazed sitcom gear, the lark stops.Solid, sadistic Stiller fare.One of those cruel-yet-very-funny crowd pleasers.It was a well-acted, likable and benignly amusing film.Ben Stiller is simply fantastic, and this DeNiro kid could be big someday.A non-stop riot headed up by the first rate pairing of Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro.A hilarious hodgepodge of The In-Laws and Annie Hall, in which De Niro gives his best comic performance to date.A straightforward romantic comedy that doesn\\'t take a lot of chances, but still manages to deliver the goods.Stiller, who is shaping up to be one of the most adept comic performers of our time, does a terrific job of building sympathy for the hapless outsider.A five star hoot.The sight-gags and verbal repartee hinge upon uninspired, lowest-common-denominator hijinks.Meet the Parents generates most of its laughs in the give-and-take between Stiller and De Niro....highly amusing...at times leaves most of the men in the audience throwing their heads back and realizing exactly how realistic the situation at hand is.A brilliant comedy in which we laugh that we do not cry -- although we do wince, as every expectation the main character has of things turning out okay crumbles and his face gets ever the redder.Deliciously funny and warmly poignant, it\\'s a treat to Meet the Parents.Ben Stiller, an excellent comic actor, does some of his best work here, matched up with one of the all-time greats, Robert De Niro.None of the jokes are forced, which makes Meet the Parents a singular achievement.Even with Stiller and De Niro, Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it\\'s available on video.[Roach] does know how to stage discrete comic moments, taking mildly humorous nightmares and turning them into nicely wrought miniatures.Meet the Parents builds brilliantly on interlocking comic situations.With current comedy obsessed with oh-so-clever ironic gestures and tricksy pastiche, Meet the Parents\\' dedication to consistent, straightforward belly laughs is totally refreshing.The jokes work, because they are so relentless and absurd.Meet the Parents gets its best moments in the friction between De Niro and Stiller. Their screen personas -- the intimidator and the hapless smart guy -- are a perfect mismatch, and the spark between them ignite plenty of laughs.Stiller is brilliant.Most of the humor here is pretty clever.Meet the Parents doesn\\'t sparkle like Vincente Minnelli\\'s Father of the Bride. But with bubbly adult comedies at such a premium, it goes down like a flute of Champagne, leaving an aftertaste of giggles.There is a sub-category of comedy ... in which we laugh at the hideously humiliating experiences of some poor sap. If this is your kind of humor, than this is your kind of movie.Funny bits abound, overstuffed to the point of tearing at the seams, the film might have benefited from a bit more cutting. A string of non-stop humor.Flat-out hilarious.DeNiro is the real pleasure to watch.If De Niro\\'s mafia comedy Analyze This went for cheap laughs, Meet The Parents develops real depth.An unfathomably awful film that will undoubtedly be a smash hit.Meet the Parents might not be sophisticated comedy, but it\\'s certainly enjoyable.Though Meet the Parents features a capable supporting cast, the laughs come almost exclusively from the tussle between Stiller and De Niro, and both deliver.I haven\\'t laughed this hard since the trailer for Billy Elliot.Very fun and very entertaining.An entertaining comic nightmare, but like most bad dreams, it disappears once the lights come up.In many ways reminiscent of There\\'s Something About Mary.With all due respect to giggles, though, you would do better to rent Raging Bull.An adult-oriented comedy that, while hardly reserved, rests its very funny foundation on well-conceived characterization, lively dialogue and good acting.With near-Swiss precision, director/producer Jay Roach ... and his writers make sure familiarity breeds hilarity.Passable movie entertainment, but like most future in-laws leaves a feeling of something still desired.De Niro delivers.This is one hell of a funny movie, folks.Whenever the movie is about to go wrong, something happens to set it right -- usually instigated by the coldly mean De Niro or the hot, nervous Stiller.Wonderfully funny.Meet the Parents is much too herky-jerky to be completely successful, and it follows each laugh-out-loud scene with one that is completely -- or is at least a bit -- cringe-worthy.I literally found myself gasping for breath during Meet the Parents\\' most comic moments, wishing I could rewind the film.I had a good time at Meet the Parents, even though the ratio of clinkers to yucks is disproportionately high.The film is uproarious without ever becoming nasty or mean-spirited.High concept that aims for the middle and meets its mark emphatically and satisfyingly.I can\\'t remember when I last laughed so hard during a film. DeNiro and Stiller are a perfect match and I walked out of the theater wanting to see more of these characters.Quite simply, this Focker has us laughing out loud frequently and abundantly.Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller give the comedy of disaster a nice little workout.More often than not, the movie\\'s tension gets in the way of its giggles, falling back on its stars\\' comedy instincts and over-extended running gags.The real comic bite comes from the combustible energy between the two lead actors.A very funny movie that is able to combine a great premise with ideal actors, laugh out scenes with a sentimental touch and over the top sequences with a believable story line.A crisply paced romp featuring pitch-perfect performances by adversarial leads Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.While it\\'s a truism that all comedy has an element of sadism, it doesn\\'t necessarily follow that all sadism is funny.A comedy that has likeable, human characters as well as consistent laughs.Watching Ben get the girl or be seriously injured trying always has its dry, keening pleasures.It\\'s warm and humorous and avoids being mean-spirited, which alone makes it special.Plays like a thirty minute sitcom that overstays its welcome for more than an hour.This fall\\'s pleasant surprise.Jay Roach, best known for the broad farce of the Austin Powers films, shows an unexpected flair for directing character comedy.With Meet the Parents, mainstream Hollywood reclaims one of its former strengths. It proves that it still knows how to provide audiences with a good time.It never quite gets going.Great fun.I didn\\'t laugh so often as many of the people sitting around me at Meet the Parents, but I laughed enough to think: Yep, not bad.Once again, Roach smokes. Meet the Parents is an extremely pleasant surprise, a high-concept romantic comedy that actually works.The gross-out factor is surprisingly low, and the combination of Stiller and De Niro is inspired: No father could be more formidable, no prospective son-in-law better equipped to squirm.Roach ... knows to play to the movie\\'s twin strengths: Stiller and De Niro.De Niro, once again proving that he understands comedy as well as urban psychoses.Possibly the most amusing mainstream live-action comedy since There\\'s Something About Mary.Unlike most family squabbles, you\\'ll find this one an amusing diversion.It\\'s funny. Really funny.Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffs.Even better than There\\'s Something About Mary.A very funny movie.There\\'s hardly anything surprising about Meet the Parents, except that it\\'s much funnier than you might expect.Meet the Parents has all the elements of either a bedroom farce or a Hardy Boys mystery. Turns out it\\'s the former, and a mighty funny one at that.You couldn\\'t do much better than to pit De Niro at his most humorlessly imposing against Ben Stiller at his most anxiously eager to please.A refreshing change from the current trend of gross and grosser humor.It never runs out of steam or ways of inflicting more ignominy on Stiller.Meet the Parents is a one- -- well, maybe two- -- joke idea that starts out goofy and fun, but soon runs out of verbal or visual ammunition.This isn\\'t Ernst Lubitsch or anything, but the movie is consistently funny without the calculated gross-out moments that have been dominating mainstream comedy in recent years.If you can just accept the fact that real human behavior has been thrown out the window like the baby in Andy Warhol\\'s Bad, then you\\'ll have a really good time watching Stiller and De Niro square off.Within its formulaic confines, the humor works uncommonly well from time to time.If ever there was a movie that felt like it was built backward, it\\'s Meet the Parents.A clever situation-comedy that delivers quite a few laughs.You feel you\\'ve seen it all before: There\\'s Something About Mary did it funnier, and The Heartbreak Kid did it wiser. But when Stiller is let loose, you never feel that Charles Grodin did it drier.Uneven in tone, often trite and certainly neither De Niro nor Stiller\\'s finest, Meet the Parents is nevertheless a funny and sometimes substantial movie.See it with someone you love -- and maybe with his or her parents.It\\'s the prom night scene from There\\'s Something About Mary stretched out over an entire movie - just not as funny.Has all the elements for a memorable farce and succeeds more often than not.A good-spirited comedy.Meet the Parents is hysterical.Don\\'t go to this movie if you\\'ve recently had hernia surgery, because the expression \\'bust a gut laughing\\' might go beyond metaphor in your case.A comedy that works for the most part while in other sections has the audience waiting for a TV laugh track that doesn\\'t come.A hilarious comedy about the ridiculous lenghts a young man goes to in order to prove himself to his girlfriend\\'s family.Stiller and De Niro play off well against each other, and neither goes too far off the deep end.It\\'s laugh-out-loud funny.Follows a rather predictable, well-worn path, but the sheer joy of performing on the actors\\' parts sells the film as a whole.While it doesn\\'t quite live up to its potential, it\\'s still a heck of a lot funnier than what usually passes for comedy in these days.That the film works in spite of the people behind the camera says a lot for the people in front of the camera.There is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy. Certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written.nannannannannannannanStreamlining Larsson\\'s clunky storytelling, Zaillan injects a welcome streak of humour into events, giving Craig - and the rest of the superb cast - a chance to be both funny and icily ominous.A mesmerizing thriller anchored by a brilliant, revelatory performance by Rooney Mara.When you watch the film, you\\'ll understand immediately why people are obsessed with its story. Fincher\\'s movie, far truer to the novel than the Swedish version, will be a treat for fans of Larsson\\'s series.Filmmaker David Fincher is extremely conscious of the details he needs to exhibit to keep each isolated moment at a highly concentrated level.Overall, Fincher\\'s version is a chilly crime procedural, worth a watch but not world-burning in any way.All in all, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a good film and worth a visit. But do yourself a real favor and watch the original Swedish version before, after or instead of this one.Larsson was a natural heir to Mankell\\'s style, but unlike his progenitor\\'s work, both the book and film versions of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo lack Wallander\\'s good heart.overall the movie does take allegiances with both the book and original movie, but it comes into its own to unravel a truly alluring story.Deep down, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is sheer pulp.An elegant balance between light and dark, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo benefits from Fincher\\'s ascetic treatment, and will silence any of the naysayers who felt the whole American version was little more than a money grab.I can\\'t help but puzzle over the new Lisbeth and what, exactly, this film is lacking that doesn\\'t make it Fincher-level great.Steve Zaillian\\'s script trims some the novel\\'s fat, keeping the film a lean, mean and frightening beast.Whilst Fincher doesn\\'t exactly blow the original out of the water, he does add enough to make the project feel less like an unnecessary retread than it otherwise may have.Fincher takes repeated stabs at creating depth but seldom draws blood in attempting to flesh out characters that just aren\\'t that interesting. David Fincher\\'s Hollywood take on the Stieg Larsson bestseller is a sleek yet somehow soulless adaptation.A compelling ride for die-hard fans of the book series, dramatic thriller enthusiasts, as well as anyone who enjoys Fincher\\'s darker works.While this film is a brilliant, dispassionate rival to the also-brilliant Swedish original, the films that could really use the Fincher treatment are the two sequels.Fincher\\'s The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo manages to build on the original film without copying it, reinventing it or ignoring it.Feels surprisingly tame thanks to weakened characters and story changes that rob the mystery of much-needed suspense.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo can\\'t quite transcend its junk foundation or...the familiar beats of the other adaptation.A very moody, well made retelling of Stieg Larsson\\'s book, but the film also lacks much purpose and sometimes focuses on the grim with an exploitative eye.It\\'s ultimately David Fincher\\'s perfectionist talent for creating a gripping aesthetic that raises this film above your average James Patterson adaptation.Was it really worth the effort? For all Fincher\\'s famously fanatical control, he can\\'t dispel the stench of half-baked cheese that hangs over the source material.I may be one of the few who prefers the original Swedish TV version, but Fincher does a nice job of staying faithful to the Larsson novel and infusing it with his own sense of style.If you enjoy a good mystery that\\'s as grimy as a stomped on cigarette on the pavement then this film will have you hooked. Fans of the books should be pleased.It\\'s an effective, if unfathomable, entry in the Fincher canon.I could not take my eyes off the film and never once wanted to exit the theatre, all of which are attributes I don\\'t want to diminish or dispute in any way whatsoever.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" will leave its mark on you. Dark, brutal and intriguing, this version is as troubling and memorable as its Swedish counterpart. Its disturbing tone begins in the opening credits and continues to the last frame.David Fincher never lets his movie devolve into a petty revenge fantasy. The filmmaker clearly got the novel and, consequently, gets the most out of the novel. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is just what the fans were demanding.This stylish film soars; it\\'s a remake worth seeingWhat Fincher brings to the table is a particular talent for atmospheric, highly stylized mystery. What he can\\'t really fix is the fact that the source material is, structurally, a mess.This is still a slick, gripping thriller and Fincher\\'s stylish fingerprints can be seen all the way through.Fincher takes time to build the mystery slowly, showing the numbing amounts of research as well as details like freezing-cold cabins and bad vending machine coffee. Fincher\\'s film is dark and twisted, bleak and brutal: everything the book\\'s fans would want.This is a finely honed genre thriller, but it also continues Fincher\\'s preoccupation with the persistence of age-old urges in the modern world.I liked it a lot.Fincher has delivered a visually striking, well-acted, at times stomach-churning thriller, but I still can\\'t help but wish that he had taken a curve ball and continued exploring new territory rather than taking a big swing at an easy toss ...an entertaining yet somewhat disappointing effort from Fincher.As he proved last year, David Fincher can make the inherently uncinematic into thrilling cinema. Fincher is the right director to make a movie where two people rifle through endless amounts of paperwork and old photos suspenseful.A waste of a great director\\'s time.It is extraordinarily bleak. I mean, it\\'s not Requiem for a Dream bleak, but it\\'s on up there.No one could fail to enjoy this movie, but it\\'s the product of an art and an industry that went in different directions with the coming of sound, and popular English-speaking audiences never became accustomed to reading subtitles.There\\'s nothing wrong with David Fincher\\'s remake. Was it strictly necessary? That\\'s debatable.Fincher\\'s chilly, precision filmmaking knows how to tease, while still looking head-on into the abyss.A tense, unsettling plunge into a dark, toxic world where the bleak Scandinavian setting isn\\'t the only thing cold, cruel and unforgiving.Shockingly sexual, brilliantly acted, and overall strangely appealingA very impressive bit of storytelling and style that only steps wrongly in its final third.Everything else we\\'re meant to care about is an afterthought compared to the sketch of a relationship at the fringe of the film which somehow benefits from not being at the center.Mara\\'s performance stands on its own and likely gives birth to a new star.For Fincher purists, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is lumpier in plot fluidity than his other, sleeker work, but his call sign is still very much present ...The logic of a Hollywood adaptation, for the benefit of a largely untapped domestic market, is clear, not least for the film\\'s corporate sponsors: step forward McDonalds and Apple; two brave companies who\\'ve tethered their brands to incest and murder.Vengeance is the ace card in this rough game of acquiring justice in a cloaked system with degenerates at every turn. And, it\\'s a heavyweight component of the Trilogy\\'s impact no matter the medium used for its telling.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is everything you would expect from Fincher\\'s version of the book and that is the good and the bad. Slick and entertaining throughout, there is absolutely nothing in it which surprises.The bottom line is that if you were too lazy to read the subtitles in the original, you won\\'t miss Blomqvist\\'s lack of Swedish intellect this time.Handles the material competently, but not exceptionally.A hypnotic cocktail of haunting visuals, strong performances and mesmerizing score. Take the best bits of this captivating new work and cut them into the negligible flaws of the original film and you\\'d have a perfect story.The remake everyone\\'s been talking about doesn\\'t disappoint.The ultimate poseur movie... [A cinematic] temporary tattoo, a way of feeling underground without ever committing to anything real.Entertaining if blatantly sexual and sado-masochistic, inducing thrills and chills.Fincher\\'s Twilight-like Hollywood heroine is shy and moody. Not the venal, alternate lifestyle lesbian-punk hacker from the beloved book. Anybody else think Mara\\'s sex scenes with Craig were done by a body double?[H]ow else are you going to tap into that lucrative market consisting of folks who read the books but are too lazy to read subtitles?Just as I couldn\\'t stop turning the pages of Larsson\\'s novel, I couldn\\'t take my eyes off Fincher\\'s movie. Unable to make sense of Larsson\\'s already confused source material, Fincher\\'s film soon lapses into hypocrisy.... grim but striking ... Still, Fincher\\'s remake is not up to the Swedish adaptation, which was creepier and more exhilarating, especially as the Old School/New School investigatory methods kicked in. The movie feels like a cartoon, brilliantly achieved but utterly shallow.Charismatically played by Rooney Mara in David Fincher\\'s coolly executed, moody rendition of Stieg Larsson\\'s book, this tattooed girl really does kick a hornet\\'s nest. While it isn\\'t clear if another version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is necessary, Fincher couldn\\'t make it boring with all this lurid material... But in any language with anyone at the helm, Lisbeth is still a killer.Fortunately the book is virtually foolproof if you leave it to speak for itself, as [Fincher] has done, thereby delivering a decent movie.Fincher\\'s version oozes style, delivering an eye catching cinematic experience, while editing of the action is snappy.If you\\'re about to enter the world of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo for the first time, this is a terrific place to start.Can\\'t think of too many times a Hollywood version is so much superior to a European original.Rooney Mara isn\\'t quite as in-your-face as Noomi Rapace was playing Lisbeth in the Swedish films, yet she is both tough and sensitive...The master of the thriller genre, Alfred Hitchcock, knew that even the nastiest stories need light as well as shade. Fincher\\'s too busy darkening his garish source material to care.Unmissable.It\\'s certainly worth seeing if you missed the original. If you saw it, however, there\\'s no way of unseeing it, and nothing in the new one to top it.Fincher\\'s Dragon Tattoo rockets through the freezing northern European landscape like the most powerful car on the market.Fincher delivers a seedily compulsive glimpse into a cold, brutal universe seething with twisted passions, even if the story is little more than a slick, sick potboiler.We know what will happen and it\\'s still riveting.I\\'ve read the books and seen the better Swedish version and still found this interesting and tense, despite the fact that the sex and violence are considerably toned down from the original.Reminds us why murder mysteries and investigative procedurals -- useful parables about the certainty of death that have pretty much migrated to television -- can be especially compelling in a darkened theater.Elegantly, confidently made, though it\\'s so similar to the Swedish movie it does seem kind of beside the point. An astonishing blend of dark allure and damaged brilliance, Mara is compulsively watchable as Lisbeth Salander, while Craig effectively embodies quiet integrity as the humiliated reporter fleeing the limelight while sharpening his investigatory skills.What transfixes here isn\\'t the labyrinthine plotting -- we\\'re almost overly familiar with that by now -- but Mara\\'s Lisbeth, surely one of the most incendiary antiheroines in all of cinemaFincher\\'s Dragon Tattoo is a faithful adaptation that brings the dazzle but shortchanges on the daring... It\\'s gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark.Fincher has succeeded admirably. His Girl With the Dragon Tattoo improves on both the book and the first movie.Director David Fincher has crafted a disturbing dazzler of a thriller, embellished by sharp acting. Extremely well-made, ably acted, beautifully shot and has a plot full of hairpin turns and twists. It is an entirely engaging and occasionally gripping film. It is also completely unnecessary.Fincher is perfectly suited to the material, with its voluminous clues to be organized and parsed, its emotional austerity, and its serial murder, rape, and sundry sick plot twists.Fans of the original will like this version, but many will ultimately see director David Fincher\\'s film as more cookie cutter than classic. Larsson himself would probably have loved this classier interpretation of his rather pulpy narrative.Suitably stylish remake from director David Fincher, which succeeds thanks to a strong script, striking photography and superb performances from Craig and Mara.Fincher maintains a steady tension throughout. He also adds his own tweaks to the twists at the end.Location is Fincher\\'s strongest quality, and every log cabin, train station and archival vault here feels lived-in, bone-chillingly cold and full of surprises.It\\'s a rough haul at times, but expertly executed and entirely worthy of the anticipation leading up to its release.Rooney\\'s Lisbeth takes matters large and small into her own hands with a ferocious self-sufficiency that leaves the audience gasping with both horror and a provocative delight not entirely undiluted with envy. Likable, no, but impossible to easily dismissWhat he has delivered is adequate, but it doesn\\'t have any flavor - and of all the things Fincher is, \"bland\" is not usually one of them.David Fincher\\'s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a tense thriller that unfolds with all the twists and turns one could hope to have.Highly satisfying and smart thriller, which should quiet all the naysayers who might have thought this much-anticipated zeitgeist remake project wholly unnecessary.Mara\\'s efficient, straightforward physicality and her watchful but implacable expression are just right for the character who is about to kick the hornet\\'s nest. Even though the film boasts A-list talent both in front of and behind the camera, at heart this \"Dragon Tattoo\" is pulp that\\'s just as nasty and visceral - and entertaining - as its predecessors. Immaculate style, questionable substance.Utterly engaging, a transporting bit of cinema that immerses viewers -- uncomfortably at times -- in a riveting detective story.Hollywood managed to not only not screw this one up, but actually made it one of the best movies of the year.Yet another faithful adaptation...Those fortunate enough to be making Salander\\'s acquaintance for the first time will want to hold on.David Fincher\\'s adaptation of the international best-seller is a triumph of craftsmanship over material.Practically screams out that it wants to be cool, and succeeds most of the time. Probably the best possible movie version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.The title sequence alone is the single coolest thing you will see at the movies all year.The American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is well-made, well-cast, tense and exciting. I just wish I hadn\\'t seen it all before.Dragon Tattoo offers a handsome package built on rickety foundations, hoping to pass inspection on good looks alone.The land of the midnight sun has never looked darker.The problem is that even Fincher can\\'t renew the impact of Larsson\\'s original twists, unless you have an aversion to long books or subtitlesRooney, Noomi?I love both \\'Dragon Tattoo\\' girls.An altogether leaner, meaner, more high-powered, stylish, and deftly directed affair, though similarly hampered by a too-long narrative fuse.Even Fincher\\'s elegantly gruesome style can\\'t turn this Swedish noir into the meditation on evil and corruption that it fancies itself to be.Unfortunately, Fincher doesn\\'t add much to Niels Arden Oplev\\'s Swedish version: more Googling and plot-compressing montages and an altered but still convoluted ending.A dark thriller that mines the meanings of family skeletons, power, corruption, sex, and misogyny.I can tell you that as a virgin to the story, this version of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo completely drew me into Larsson\\'s beautifully constructed, terrifying world.Provides all the jolts and forward motion that any good airport novel gives you, but it\\'s the film equivalent of the book that kept you awake from Chicago to Baltimore, only you don\\'t feel bad about leaving it on the seat next to you after you land.When it comes down to it, this is Rooney Mara\\'s movie, and I don\\'t care if the second and third stories are any good as long as they are full of Lisbeth Salander.This is what a movie adaptation should be: a film whose base narrative has its roots in the source material but whose soul can be identified through the images that unfold on screen.I wanted more pizzazz and deeper, more nuanced characterizations from Fincher and co., but for those who have no context regarding pervious Larsson presentations this story-driven procedural may be well be good enough.Surprisingly sanitized version of the Swedish blockbuster has little resonance in this Americanized form. Stick with with Swedish version - both book and film.I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen an actor do more with deadpan expressions than Mara does in this movie. Her face doesn\\'t move but, whether she\\'s tasing a man or standing in front of a mirror watching a cigarette dangle from her mouth, we respond to her.Mara\\'s Lisbeth can be brashly young and impossibly smart. It\\'s a performance that should well serve the upcoming sequels.Mara\\'s bristling, unbridled performance gives the film the ballast it needs to pull off that curious, undeniably engrossing, balancing act.The Swedish version was sloppier and trashier, which suited the material. If that movie was more lurid, it also packed more genuine emotion.It\\'s stylish, if not exactly subtle, and daringly brutal for a Hollywood movie. It\\'s also so uneven and overlong that it may leave non-fans wondering what all the fuss has been about.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that rare hard-R rated studio film that expertly weaves story and character development into the lascivious subject matter.A satisfying thriller and welcome counter-programming for the Christmas season.This is some pretty raw stuff to gift-wrap under the Christmas tree this holiday movie season. But it is also a great story for awards season, when adults can finally see movies for adults.This Dragon flies, but it never really breathes fire.The kick in this material, especially in this new version which plays down Mikael\\'s surliness, is Lisbeth, a pixieish polysexual outlier who seems equipped with her own portable storm cloud.She\\'s fascinating and tough ... wish the film was a bit more like her. It\\'s a warm dragon, rather than a fiery one.The Fincher version doesn\\'t actively negate the presence of the earlier one - it doesn\\'t have to - but its confidence and bravado are like a strong blast of sunlight with the ability to fade the memory of whatever came before.The stellar, English-language take on \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" burrows so deeply into the heads of its characters that even when they\\'re just thinking, it\\'s deeply thrilling.Seeing Fincher\\'s version is like getting a Christmas gift of a book you already have.While it feels churlish to complain about a genre piece that\\'s been executed with such precise craft, I have to confess that, in both versions, I\\'ve found Dragon Tattoo\\'s plot profoundly boring.The dynamic between Craig and Mara in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is so sensational, it instantly propels the movie beyond glossy, high-toned pulp into something far more affecting.This is an ingenious and engrossing work of pop cinema. That said, when it was over I felt a wave of ennui wash over me upon reflecting that we\\'ve got two more of these to go.The new \"Tattoo\" is buoyed by Fincher\\'s peerless craftsmanship. Never has a director been better suited to photographing winter scenes near the Arctic Circle.A solidly crafted, creepily suspenseful thriller.A visually impressive, well acted adaptation of the book, with significant differences in tone from the Swedish film.Even those who know the torturous story by heart will be impressed by the intense focus, attention to detail and fidelity to the original material that director David Fincher brings this jagged little tale.Fincher\\'s electrifying storytelling makes the most of unsettling visuals, large casts, complex plots and sharp dialogue.This film\\'s cold, almost robotic conception of Salander as a twitchy, anorexic waif feels more like a stunt than a complete character, and so the best part of the reason we care enough to endure all that mayhem has gone away.Once the hype dies, this movie will be best enjoyed as a drinking game. Down a shot of Absolut every time Craig whips his glasses on or off and you\\'ll be blitzed by the halfway point.The film hits a nice groove in the interplay between Craig and Mara, together and apart, and Fincher displays his usual mastery at explicating the finer points of an investigation.In the incendiary performance by Rooney Mara, one of the year\\'s best, you have all the incentive you need to drag out the Dragon Tattoo gun yet again.This is never the kind of movie where they\\'re going to fall in love. That she even smiles is a breakthrough.Larsson has whipped up something unique - Agatha Christie with techno Goths - yet this is unremarkable. If anything, the mixing of elements feels clumsy.This studio version is, oddly enough, far less commercial and only about a quarter as lushly mysterious as the superior overseas original. Exquisitely crafted, curiously uninvolving.Fincher has made a movie that is not only wholly redundant in light of the original but also one that is worse than its already problematic predecessor.An incredibly well-executed thriller that transcends its admittedly pulpy and occasionally ridiculous source material with an extraordinary degree of technical skilDaniel Craig and Rooney Mara are fine in the leads, but when it comes to the actual plot, one does get the feeling that it didn\\'t need to be told again. Newcomers to the story may disagree.A rarity in that it is an improvement over the Swedish language original, this intricately-woven, edge-of-your-seat whodunit is as graphic and grisly as it is cerebral and mind-bending. Projects and directors are rarely better matched than The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and David Fincher.Dragon Tattoo\" knows precisely how to achieve its look, rhythm, sound and spirit. It\\'s extremely well made by a genuine and reliable talent. But I thought he was done with this sort of thing.Not too surprisingly, Fincher doesn\\'t bring his auteur A-game here, though his crafty B-game is better than most.With great pizzazz, Fincher\\'s creative team\\'s original style wrings suspense from the aspects that are a pastiche of other thrillers.Fincher pushes the tale of serial killing to the blackest depths of noir depravity.There\\'s powerful craft here, and Larsson\\'s story has more than proven its ability to grip.Mr. Fincher\\'s impressive skill is evident, even as his ambitions seem to be checked by the limitations of the source material and the imperatives of commercial entertainment.Justifies its existence by improving on Niels Arden Oplev\\'s serviceable but unspectacular Swedish predecessor, though it can\\'t overcome the flaws of the original book.I\\'m not sure I\\'ve seen a more superfluous film that Fincher\\'s pointless second take on a story that was served supremely well onscreen so recently...Mara\\'s performance has a ferocity that will linger in your mind long after the two or three endings have faded.Throbs as a tale of good people wanting to right wrongs with the truth if possible, and violence if necessary.I\\'m not impugning Fincher\\'s intentions; I\\'m just saying that, as good as his film may be, it\\'s redundant and unnecessary. A tough, post-punk Tintin-meets-Klute for the Occupy Wall Street set, this kinetic, hard-edged thriller is the perfect festive comedown for Fincher fans and dysfunctional families everywhere.[Fincher] never abandons his meticulousness -- it\\'s what allows him to position you in the exact right spot to deliver the blow. Despite the riveting Lisbeth reinvention and Fincher\\'s visual prowess, source material problems remain in the form of creepy sexual politics and patchwork storytelling.By focusing on the strongest part of the best selling novels, David Fincher and Steve Zallian have delivered a stylish, mesmerizing thriller. David Fincher\\'s first-rate direction effortlessly wipes the floor with the soporific Swedish counterpart. In the end, though, even Fincher can\\'t froth up some of the novel\\'s more procedural killer-of-the-week fancies.In less experienced hands, this would surely have wound up as lurid, trashy pulp. Yet Fincher plays it straight and keeps it serious.Ultimately it\\'s Mara who has to pull it off and deliver Lisbeth\\'s unique brand of cunning and power fueled by revenge. She\\'s a knockout.Hypnotic at times, masterfully evoking locations and blurred headspace through precise imagery -- pure silver screen math. Fincher respects the clue-gobbling tonality of the story, but he also keeps his directorial fingerprint fresh.A mesmerizing movie that veers towards an unbearably tense climax, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo benefits from invigorating direction and superb acting that allows the old-fashioned mystery to unravel in a hugely satisfying and captivating way.Every decision made here, from how the novel was refined to the controversial casting of Rooney Mara to one of the best technical teams of the year was the right one.David Fincher\\'s American version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a powerhouse of a picture. And, in an incredible feat, Rooney Mara wrests the role away from the unforgettable Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version -- Mara and Fincher make it her own.The great screenwriter Steven Zaillian\\'s elaborate, convoluted script, so muddled that even after it\\'s over you still don\\'t know what it\\'s all about, is a drawback -- but the movie is a master class in sinister style, tense and deeply uncomfortable.[VIDEO] David Fincher can do a great re-make. Now, let\\'s hope he never does one again. Though Fincher hits all the right emotional beats and does all the memorable set pieces, his exquisite craft can\\'t distract from a number of troubling questions at the story\\'s core.Crisp, stylish and well-acted English-language adaptation. Rooney Mara rocks this role.Fans of the book and film should rest easy at how this \\'Dragon Tattoo\\' is still inherently a Swedish tale - set and partly shot in Sweden - and Fincher doesn\\'t flinch from the sexual violence at their core.Fincher fires on all cylinders to save this story from itself, exhibiting the propulsive energy of Fight Club and the storytelling mastery of Zodiac and The Social Network.[Fincher] has made The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo into an electrifying movie by turning the audience into addicts of the forbidden, looking for the sick and twisted things we can\\'t see.It\\'s easy to see why David Fincher wanted to make it, but hard to shake the feeling that perhaps he shouldn\\'t have bothered.Craig is an anchor of cool rationality and judiciousness around which Mara revolves like a demon.Changed ending aside, Fincher\\'s take is as faithful as it is fearless. And Mara rocks.Yep, that\\'s \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.Fincher synthesizes the best of both of his two previous serial killer movies, but combines them with a maturity that shouldn\\'t be mistaken for boredom with the material. David Fincher\\'s much-anticipated return to serial-killer territory is a fastidiously grim pulp entertainment that plays like a first-class train ride through progressively bleaker circles of hell.Fine American version of the literary sensation delivers everything except that something extra.This darker, slicker and more humane re-telling of Swedish crime thriller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo improves upon previous adaptations, thanks to David Fincher\\'s vast skills as a master of dark suspense. Monstrously skillful and powerfully engrossing. This is a taut thriller that sadly overstays its welcome with an extended finale that isn\\'t nearly as satisfying.Turns out- Fincher was right all along. Rooney Mara is a perfect Salander. Her performance, combined with the Reznor/Ross score, makes this a perfect adaptation of Stieg Larsson\\'s entertaining novel. A must-see. ...a good enough thriller with fine production values, but it\\'s not top notch Fincher. Where it should have shrieked and howled it only occasionally rattles the windows.Subpar material gets a tonal and aesthetic - and, by extension, thematic - boost from directorial virtuosity in David Fincher\\'s American remake.You\\'ll be happier with the film if you don\\'t expect fidelity to source material, but that doesn\\'t mean you\\'ll hate it if you loved Niels Arden Oplev\\'s movie.As played by Mara, Lisbeth is the ultimate badass; a formidable force of hyperintellect and raging sexuality. ... if you love these books, then consider this a Christmas present.A bracing and completely absorbing thriller.The most handsome funeral procession ever mounted--which is, in the end, better than feeling like you\\'re the corpse lying inside the coffin.This is a bleak but mesmerizing piece of filmmaking; it offers a glancing, chilled view of a world in which brief moments of loyalty flicker between repeated acts of betrayal.Hollywood\\'s motivation for trying to cash in on a hot title is clear. It\\'s not so easy to divine [David] Fincher\\'s reasons for signing on.Schwarzenegger is never going to make the De Niros and Hoffmans of this world lose a night\\'s sleep, but he has acquired a new confidence as an actor under Verhoeven\\'s guidance.Total Recall is slick, sly and subversive, and if some of the special effects have aged somewhat, that only adds to the charm.All told, Total Recall is a powerful brew of mordant humor, keen wit, refreshing originality and graphic violence.As Quaid, Schwarzenegger continues to stretch beyond his reach as an actor, relying on physical prowess to keep him in character.Total Recall went through four directors before Verhoeven finally took it on, and four writers worked on the script. It\\'s no wonder the finished film emerges without a unifying style, or a single performance worth mentioning.If the movie sometimes seems overwhelmed by its budget and its legendary third-act problems, it\\'s still entertainingly raw and brutal, full of whiplash pace and juicy exaggeration.If Total Recall isn\\'t as much fun as I\\'d hoped, it\\'s not as dreary as I\\'d feared. I wouldn\\'t call it totally awesome, but it\\'s far from being a total loss.The movie is a cartoon, though a mammothly enjoyable one.This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator.Arnold Schwarzenegger brings an effective blend of machismo and innocence to his role. Too bad director Paul Verhoeven lets brainless violence and tricky special effects swamp the cleverness of the tale itself.Total Recall begins to self-destruct not long after Schwarzenegger arrives on Mars, and the story degenerates into a violent, stunningly foul-mouthed enterprise.If you don\\'t ask too many questions, or just accept that it\\'s all a dream so logic and science don\\'t matter, then this is an enjoyable romp.Paul Verhoeven\\'s version of the original story packs a real sense of intellect and brilliant ambiguity beneath the seemingly surface science fiction action tale...A wickedly violent, action-packed old school piece of warped, twist-filled sci-fi and Schwarzenegger cheese. You\\'ll wish you had three hands to hold this one.Total Recall\\'s caricaturing of Schwarzenegger, its flip ribbing at his stocks of action-hero cache, signal the deep, almost atomic level at which its satire functions. When the leader of the rebels turns out to be Baby Herman from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it\\'s clear that the satirical bull\\'s-eyes Verhoeven nailed in RoboCop have here been turned into a more benign state of rib-nudging.Verhoeven\\'s version of Philip Dick\\'s story is vigorous, exciting, and inventive sci-fi thriller, combining pulp savviness, ultra-graphic violence, and Oscar-winning special effects.It\\'s still a guilty pleasure - though the guilt quotient is a bit higher - and that\\'s down to the still-extraordinary presence of the massively gym-built Arnold...Still a ripsnorting yarn with lashings of sex and violence that hasn\\'t aged a day.Overall, the movie\\'s imaginative effects and ideas win the day.An absolutely superb sci-fi film and a true modern cornerstone of the genre not seen since the deeper though less entertaining Blade Runner nearly ten years previous.Total Recall is too much -- but it\\'s too much of a good thing.Total Recall is fine entertainment, complete with breathtaking action sequences and special effects that impress even in these computer-generated times.The fierce and unrelenting pace, accompanied by a tongue-in-cheek strain of humor in the roughhouse screenplay, keeps the film moving like a juggernaut.Ugly, stupid, loud, offensive, and pointlessly violent.A worthy entry in the dystopian cycle launched by Blade Runner, this seems less derivative than most of its predecessors yet equally accomplished in its straight-ahead storytelling, with plenty of provocative satiric undertones and scenic details.Say what you will about Verhoeven\\'s penchant for extravagant theatrics, when he\\'s not yanking the arms off people or putting bullets in their forehead, he tells a good story.The future doesn\\'t come any better....people are allowed to change their mindsOh for the days when Verhoeven was still in Holland.Mediocre sci-fi. Gained a cult following, for some unknown reason.Melding the ever-more-workable Schwarzenegger mystique with a better-than-average science-fiction premise, the director Paul Verhoeven has come up with a vigorous, superviolent interplanetary thriller that packs in wallops with metronomic regularity.While it may seem dated today, the film showcases Sharon Stone, evil wife to Schwarzenegger. You may want to take notice of how precious air is after seeing it.This is a very interesting film and is also successful as a headlong roller-coaster ride of a pure action film.This futuristic science fiction is based on a Philip K. Dick short story, and features award-winning special effects.A cheerfully reprehensible bloodfest, spiced up by Verhoeven\\'s imaginative mayhem.Mindless, harmless popcorn flick. Emphasis on the mindless.Mind-bending psychodrama.Watching it now especially, it seems even more ahead of its time with it\\'s altered-reality storyline.Ridiculous, but also plenty of funPerhaps it goes without saying that Total Recall is no The Terminator, but let the records show.Arnold Schwarzenegger is a fool to think he\\'ll make it as the Johnny Carson of action films.Worryingly satisfying in a purely gruesome, beat-em-up kinda way.Neither Arnold Schwarzenegger nor Paul Verhoeven have stretched their talents here.There may be people who overlook the Arnold Schwarzenegger performance in Total Recall who think he isn\\'t really acting. But the performance is one of the reasons the movie works so well.A gratuitous explosion of vainglory and guts, the movie is all firecrackers and giblets and broken glass. The overall effect is like wading through hospital waste.Schwarzenegger has enough inherent charm and likeability that he\\'s better off when he just lets the story pull him along, as he does here.Until director Paul Verhoeven allows the violence to reach the berserk level, Arnold Schwarzenegger and a spectacular special-effects team seem on their way to a futuristic classic.Verhoeven keeps the whole thing chugging along neatly with a huge dollop of ultra-violence and gore. Schwarzenegger is at his best ever.It should please pretty much anyone who likes science fiction films. It should have a broad range of appeal on many levels.[A] well paced, entertaining and thought-provoking piece of science fiction cinema, a truly superb, yet disregarded gem of that particular genre.nannannannannannannanThere\\'s just a gripping story and a tremendously talented cast. Craig takes Bond seriously, and he\\'s a pleasure to watch.The film makes Bond feel relevant and new without forgetting what made those old Bond films work.It doesn\\'t celebrate the glamorous lifestyle of a dashing spy so much as it makes you worry about him and his Ma\\'am.Bond can be forever reinvented, reinterpreted, updated. And as Skyfall is showing, he\\'s more popular than ever.The theme of Skyfall is that the world must remain safe for white Englishmen to run around shooting people who aren\\'t white and English.What ultimately hobbles Skyfall is its dramatic imbalance at both macro and micro levels.This is a gorgeous film to look at, and a highly entertaining one to watch.A stirring addition to the James Bond franchise.Britain is quite diverse right now, feel free to reflect that anytime, Mr. Bond.James Bond has been relegated to cinematic stupidity before, but demoting the character to this degree of slightness is even more deflating.Skyfall gets off to a fast start. I can\\'t recall when I\\'ve enjoyed a pre-title sequence more. It achieves an effective balance between the ever-escalating action sequences that each successive Bond picture apparently demands, fresh use of charismatic talent, and nods to the legacySkyfall elevates the Bond genre to a new level of A-list refinement. But it\\'s a game-changing movie in more ways than one.Mendes and Deakins have] created the most beautifully deep focus context for Bond yet, pushing and pulling him into landscapes... that each promise the physically compromised spy nothing less than the most cinematically gorgeous sort of doom.Urbane yet never too serious, and beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, this all seems a good fit for director Sam Mendes, who\\'s made his career imposing a sort of British pretense on American movies.A Bond film should feature a menacing villain who\\'s also just a touch daffy; Javier Bardem has more fun than anybody else onscreen as a rogue agent with a mommy complex and a come-hither leer.Everything is heavy and dark, but Bond plus terrorists is damn entertaining.It stands up with the finest work that Deakins has ever done, which pretty much means that it\\'s as gorgeous as film gets.Skyfall acts as though every new James Bond adventure needs to earn our belief that he still matters, and that a secret agent with a soul can be just as compelling as an exploding pen.It seems engineered to please fans old and new, and tells a clever -- but not too clever -- story with wry humor, well-conceived action sequences and depth and meaning for the character.It\\'s certainly smarter than the last few Bonds that have zipped in and out of the viewer\\'s mind. The impact of this espionage adventure lasts after it has ended.If Casino Royale changed the dynamics of Bond, Skyfall\\'s cemented them.Locationwise, there is stunning photography of Shanghai and the wilds of Scotland by veteran Roger Deakins.This is the true reboot of the franchise, the film in which, three movies into his tenure, Daniel Craig becomes the best James Bond there ever was.Expertly shot by the unlikely genius Roger Deakins -- who does spectacular work in the film\\'s Shanghai chapter -- Skyfall is one of those movie movies that manages to impress you with its heft.Most Bond films have flaws but few Bond films end up as enjoyable as this.Make no mistake about it, Bond is back on top form, and won\\'t be hanging up his tuxedo yet.Skyfall is the kind of film that makes it easy to love Bond the way you probably did as a kid.It\\'s never dull, occasionally surprising and unafraid to delve into Bond\\'s life more than any film since On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service. Unfortunately, all of that comes at the price of gaping plot holes and staggering lapses in logic.Skyfall is not simply one of the very best Bond films, it\\'s one of the year\\'s best movies, period.From the very first shot of Skyfall, it\\'s clear that this isn\\'t just another James Bond movie.Skyfall is the smartest Bond film for many years, and though aficionados will enjoy the many nods to past films, this is a film that sets out a future path for Bond.You leave the theatre thinking less of the spectacular action and instead ponder the complex heart and soul that make James Bond such an indelible and truly iconic figure. This spectacularly entertaining epic takes several risks and yet, nevertheless, pays off splendidly.Skyfall is indeed the best Bond film ever. And maybe even better than that.As the James Bond film franchise continues to get a vigorous shaking, consider this critic sufficiently stirred.At times Skyfall is simply sensational.During it all, Bond and M indulge in enough soul-searching conversations to create a real personal drama, and that alone might make this a different and, in some ways, better Bond film.If a Bond movie is essentially a string of sequences, Skyfall\\'s contributions delight.This latest installment, which firmly cements Daniel Craig as one of the best Bonds ever, feels more serious, less gimmicky, more geared towards mature adults.All we can reasonably be sure of what they\\'ve been telling us since From Russia With Love: James Bond will return. He\\'s welcome back any time.Some Bond films show their age. Not Skyfall. It\\'s super sky-high entertainment and brimming with excitement.Craig has relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness.As an attempt to fill in Bond as a character, rather than just make the same film over, Mendes has succeeded, I think.One of the year\\'s most crackling adventure films, one of Bond\\'s most satisfying outings, and proof that you can indeed teach an old horndog new tricks.In a late-year picture that ordinary moviegoers really cared about, with good reason, Judi Dench\\'s M rivaled Daniel Craig\\'s James Bond in screen time and easily outdid him in complexity of motive.In Sam Mendes\\'s first Bond movie, dazzlingly photographed by Roger Deakins, the sequences shot in wintry London and Scotland stand out.The franchise\\'s signature elaborate action sequences are fewer and shorter, making for a more intimate, personal story.Director Sam Mendes can\\'t decide if he\\'s shooting a chilly noir or a Roger Moore camp classic.Visual elements draw from a theatrical vocabulary, such as a besorrowed M overlooking gray London at a window slashed with billions of cold tears, match-cut to wounded Bond cascading over a waterfall like a spent package.It\\'s not just a terrific Bond movie; it\\'s a terrific movie, period. Mendes has embraced the general super-ness of Bond and taken his inspiration from the best superhero flick of recent years: The Dark Knight.One of the better bonds, but it isn\\'t as good as Daniel Craig\\'s first outing.Solicits swoons like the best Bonds ever did, even if Bond\\'s dangerously close to decommission.A very British Bond, and also a very personal one. Sam Mendes revitalizes the James Bond franchise with a slick and action-packed entry. Daniel Craig proves yet again why he\\'s the best Bond yet.Bond traditions haven\\'t just been updated -- they\\'ve been intelligently modified and rethought, giving us the franchise\\'s inherent pleasures in a new package.Skyfall proves that a long-standing series can deliver the expected fundamentals while keeping the new films fresh and unpredictable.It\\'s been a long time since I enjoyed a Bond movie so much.It\\'s a pity Fleming never lived to see Craig\\'s hyper-masculine yet vulnerable Bond: he\\'s well on his way to being the best of them all.Skyfall epitomizes what a Bond movie should be, and its director, for once, justifiably deserves much of the credit.James Bond looks broken and weary, an embodiment of a traditional model of international spydom, the one premised on national borders, white-Western-wealthy entitlements, and excessive consumptions of alcohol, cars, and women.I have no compulsion whatsoever in declaring Skyfall, in terms of cinematography, the best looking Bond film ever ... Action movies simply don\\'t look like this - but ... this is no ordinary action movie.Sentimental touches underscore the fun and frivolity of Bond\\'s past while relishing the brutal landscape of the modern day super-spy.Sam Mendes has done a magnificent job, creating both a relevant and timeless entry into the Bond canon, while deftly adding homages to the series\\' past....tough and grim but still spry ... feels like something of a rearguard action in the case of the British Empire.Sometimes the old ways are the best. This is a theme and repeated line running throughout the new James Bond film Skyfall and never has it been more true.Not the best Bond movie ever but a very good one; a little darker but still unsettled as to what type overall it wants to be.Too often this martini is sloppy, not smooth.Skyfall is not, of course, \\'\\'darker\\'\\' or more serious than previous Bond films, but it\\'s more knowing about its own conventions.Fabulous entertainment.Breathes fresh life into the genre.A lot of critics are claiming this to be the best Bond film ever made; they may well be right-to some degree. It\\'s certainly the most poignant-which, in what is ostensibly an action film, is a feather in Mendes\\' cap to be sure. Suffers from unconvincing plotting, and a third act so bad it brings the roof of the whole endeavour caving inEven die-hard Sean Connery fans will have to admit there\\'s another actor who can portray James Bond when they see \\'Skyfall.\\'Mendes does a superb job maintaining tension - and releasing it from time to time so we can take a breath, have a laugh, sit back from the edge of our seat - as he shows how seriously the James Bond character can be taken, without breaking itSkyfall is inconsistent, displaying Bond at its blandest and Bond at its best.Best...Bond...ever.Sweeping action, solid characters, spectacular scenery, a bountiful sense of cleverness, and a pitch-perfect tone of self-reference to the long line of Bond pop-culture mythology. Mendes and Co. has an astutely cunning way to keep our blood pumping every minute of the latest and, arguably, best time we\\'ve had with the enduring Bond in years.Better than the average Bond, but not the greatest.a crackerjack Bond film that cannily mixes the harder, more severe edges of the previous Craig films with a sly sense of humorThe latest James Bond adventure proves, at least in my opinion, that Craig has grasped the role better than any of his predecessors, including Sean Connery.Skyfall succeeds in providing epic escapism with just the right balance of action, art-house aesthetics and melodrama. I had more fun with it than I didn\\'t, which is more than I can say about a lot of these big budget event movies.\\'Quantum of Solace,\\' was a dour, dire letdown. This picture\\'s a substantial bounce back, and easily the best Craig Bond picture. Emotional depth and all.Bardem\\'s Silva and the spectacular image-making breathe new life into the old firm. Bond-age has rarely been so much fun.This is a strong, fast, and sexy action story that gives us something different from the Bond films we have seen before.While [the film] gets more emotional and resonant as it goes on, it also gets much slower and narrower in scope.Traveling the world, solving a mystery, hunting people down, killing some of those people...everything that you want James Bond to do. Then it takes an interesting turn.Skyfall might stand as the lone example of a satisfying, standalone narrative blending with all those tried-and-true Bond tropes. Adele tune aside, Mendes makes nary a misstep....just as Marc Forster went off the rails in Quantum of Solace during that silly horse-race juxtaposition, so too does Mendes go overboard with the deconstruction/dysfunction. Nothing Like A Good VillianI wanted to like Skyfall more than I did, which is funny because after the opening sequence, I felt sure I would love it.In more ways than one, Bond is back.This is one of the better Bond films in the franchise.A key aspect of any movie is how quickly it can reel you in. In the case of Skyfall, this box is ticked in the opening few minutes.never a better villain than Bardem, blonde and mincing with a scathingly brilliant intellect at the service of a twisted, raging mother complex, and there has not been a better mother complex in film since PsychoSkyfall returns Bond to Solid GroundIt\\'s an old-fashioned Bond movie--or at least promises the next one will be--and that\\'s good news for many.A bloated, tedious, uninspired, sluggish and vapid bore that can only be enjoyed by very shallow, unctuous philistines.Who pays the price for Skyfall? Bond fans do, of course. But so does Daniel Craig. He\\'s not going to be around forever - not in this shape, anyway.... the best-looking Bond movie ever made. Roger Deakins\\' cinematography is full of striking silhouettes, some stark and simple as woodcuts, others multi-layered and illusory.Tough and taciturn, Craig has re-energized the franchise after the shaky Brosnan years, definitely demonstrating that the series has once again earned its license to thrill.Skyfall may not be another Casino Royale, but it ranks higher than almost anything else the franchise has had to offer for over a decade. What Mendes delivers is a mixed blessing: a Bond film so self-serious it condescends to the frivolities it pretends to honor.Skyfall is a great movie. It\\'s a welcome sight to see it bring the franchise into modern filmmaking.An espionage thriller mixed with a revenge story wrapped in a character study about the world\\'s favorite secret agent.Old and new, Skyfall follows the well-worn patterns of its predecessorsDoes Bond still have it?The franchise has refashioned itself by never once forgetting its glorious history, including a certain \\'Goldfinger\\' car.Among the most ambitious imaginings of Bond to date: dark, supple, and punctuated with moments of unanticipated visual brilliance. ...a combination of the old and the new, the predictable and the completely unexpected.Now with Skyfall the sweet spot is back; the movie unspools as a thrilling action flick packed with witty little touches that Bond fans will recognize as big, fat valentines to the franchise\\'s past.Is Skyfall the best Bond film yet? No. Is it a smart and engaging Bond film? Absolutely.SKYFALL returns to basics. The plot and economical but riveting action sequences are secondary to the film\\'s cinematography, direction, acting and writing.Mendes\\' approach to action is classical and elegant - no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here - but what makes the movie special is the attention he pays his actors. Bond returns for more racy, action-packed thrills.The opening sequence is very Bond-esque, but the film itself is way too long, and actually tedious halfway through. While it is a typically ambitious James Bond venture, the movie is far too long. Ninety-five minutes would have been fine. But for my money, there isn\\'t anything else Bond can do to thrill movie audiences. It is time to retire.A sly, deconstructionist approach to Bond combined with a climactic sequence that is hands-down the best, most gorgeously shot, and most breathtakingly thrilling in the franchise\\'s history make this one of the most satisfying and well-made entries.When the credits declare, as they traditionally do, that \"James Bond will return,\" you\\'ll be eager for that return to come as soon as possible.Skyfall is visually impressive from beginning to end, offers what feels like the closing of one exciting Bond chapter and the opening of another, and features some of the most blood pumping action sequences of the Daniel Craig Bond films.Skyfall\" is thrilling, it\\'s funny, it\\'s moving and it\\'s the one thing that James Bond movies never, ever used to be - surprising. So Skyfall may not be the film you are expecting from the franchise but it\\'s a film that will prove more satisfying with each viewing.Daring to broach the subject of how dated the characters and the series are, Daniel Craig, Judi Dench and director Sam Mendes make one of the best Bond\\'s of all. If this proves to be a transitional film, let it be as an introduction to an agent who comes back with his sense of humor intact. This sensitive new Bond world is really not enough.Quibble here and there over a sequence or a subplot that occasionally drifts off course from Skyfall\\'s narrowly focused story, but this is a film that roars with enthusiasm, guts, and a sense of freedom from genre conventions.The whole franchise has been given a new shot of vitality and vigor.Its canny blend of ingredients is sure to entertain any audience but I think Bond enthusiasts will relish it most, as it draws on our familiarity with the series\\' many touchstones.One of the best Bond movie ever, this thriller offers up great action sequences and a smart dialogue. This is a movie that raises the question of Bond\\'s origins in a way we\\'ve never seen. Yes, Skyfall really is as great as you\\'ve been hearing.The last scenes reshuffle the deck with a tipped cap to tradition and a clear eye on the future. They suggest Bond has learned all he must to persevere. Perhaps he can go forth defined less by those he\\'s lost and have a little fun in doing so.In the span of three films Craig has made the character his ownIt\\'s a fine action film. I just wish I could say it was more fun.Skyfall\" is a different kind of Bond movie, one that works just fine on its own terms, but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise. One \"Skyfall\" is enough.Great heroes are often enhanced by the villains they face, and such is the situation here. To really work, Bond needs great bad guys. Silva is bad at its best....because of all the mindless action, it\\'s OK as an entertainment even though it\\'s much darker and devoid of the bon mots that highlighted most Bond films.Skyfall leaves you wondering whether this incarnation of the character has anywhere left to go. It\\'s the portrait of a spy at the end of his rope by an actor who seems close to his.The movie\\'s smartest suit is emotional intelligence: Skyfall keeps us caring, intensely, for a hero who, by any rational measure, is a vestige of a vanished era.This is the movie in which the newest Bond finally eases into the part of the bon vivant for-Queen-and-Country horndog who likes his martinis shaken and not stirred.The director, Sam Mendes, has taken a pop concept and solemnized it with Freud, which is not, perhaps, the best way of turning Bond into grownup entertainment.Craig has settled into a well-suited, grim-reaper role. Even when James flirts and trysts, his creased face suggests an unmovable weight.This is it -- this is James Bond in all of his glory -- in what easily ranks up there with the best Bond films of them all.There\\'s a gritty, real-world feel to Skyfall that makes good use of Craig\\'s down-to-earthiness.One of the best Bond pictures ever...a satisfying blend of the old and the new.Skyfall is a rollicking good Bond and Daniel Craig\\'s best.Craig\\'s working-class, grim Bond is compelling, and \"Skyfall\" tries to give, in its third act, some insight into how he got that way.After all the hopes that I had for this film being the return to greatness for the franchise, I am sad to report that Bond has once again misfired.This is a smashing entertainment, but also one that feels over-engineered and constrained by its origins.While \"Skyfall\" obviously has a great fondness for the past, it\\'s not trapped there. It also anticipates Bond\\'s future. In this immensely satisfying movie, so do we.A disappointing James Bond thriller.Despite a lack of complexity, \"Skyfall\" is a respectable chapter in the Bond saga.Skyfall\" may be the most intimate Bond film yet.The new Bond thrills but falls short of greatness.What propels this grisly chapter is the characters\\' keen sense of agency.Noted killjoy Sam Mendes might seem like a counterintuitive addition to the series, but it turns out he\\'s aces with action staging and set-pieces soaked in local flavor.The filmmakers expertly balance historical homages and modern action.Craig\\'s most effective Bond movie yet.Fueled as much by Daniel Craig\\'s vulnerable portrayal of Bond as its crisp action sequences, Mendes offers a rock-solid entry in the long-running franchise.This is Bond like you\\'ve never seen him and a dynamite Daniel Craig, never better in the role, nails Bond\\'s ferocity and feeling. Skyfall is smashing, just smashing.Skyfall is as satisfying as a great martini.Bond. James Bond is back.Daniel Craig\\'s greatest Bond adventure yet... A shining example of what can be achieved when you combine blockbuster filmmaking with prestige talent.With spectacular action sequences, a rock-solid star and a ration of cheese that\\'s good English cheddar, \"Skyfall\" is a gift from above.It\\'s a modern twist on a classic series and just when you might be wondering about yet another iconic Bond element - bingo, the filmmakers deliver with an ending that leaves you wanting more.Sam Mendes adds freshness in this smart, character-driven film, as middle-aged Bond thrives in today\\'s terror-ridden world. Still loaded with action, the best Bond in years. James Bond goes home in every sense in this ravishingly entertaining entry in the series. Five decades later, it all of a sudden feels fresh, fun, and utterly engaging. As much as Casino Royale felt like a game-changer six years ago, Skyfall moves the ball further down the field. It is both grander and grimmer. A clear and unequivocal improvement over the reprehensible Quantum of Solace...Gets Bond back to the basics: bullets, babes, big-time bad guys and bawdy humor.From the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by Adele, it\\'s clear that \"Skyfall\" will be both classic and of-the-moment.It\\'s a terrific movie that will work just as well for Bond fans and Bond newbies.Skyfall doesn\\'t forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all, but from its first scene, it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action.This is a full-blooded, joyous, intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon, with Daniel Craig taking full possession of a role he previously played unconvincingly.Playful...the most conspicuously repeated word is \\'game,\\' the most dangerous of which Bond typically is, pursues, or plays.Skyfall is an awesome James Bond movie until it gets tired of all that, goes a little crazy and turns into a not-so-awesome Home Alone movie. This is perhaps the most visually stunning Bond movie ever made. Too self-serious for its own good and attempts at giving it a lighter edge fall flat, but there is the suggestion at the end that this new, remodeled Bond is still only getting started.The movie makes a claim that can\\'t be matched by many Bond films: It\\'s actually about something.Skyfall\\'s fatal misstep is its slavish hewing to event-movie trends.In \"Skyfall,\" Mendes has given us a thrilling new chapter in a franchise that by all rights should have been gasping for air - which really makes him the hero of this saga.[Mendes] and screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan have managed what feels like the best possible thing that could have happened to Bond: They\\'ve made him fun again.We get the gadgets, the nods to previous Bond films, the martinis and all but \"Skyfall\" succeeds by not resting on its veritable history but by adding more depth to the celebrated franchise.Skyfall is easily one of the best films in the series -- a cracking thriller molded to a shrewd study of Bond and his domain.The best of Craig\\'s adventures; a superbly mounted, clear-headed adventure with enough delicious oddity and exhilaration to help forget there ever was a Quantum of Solace.Mendes distills the Bond ethos in a single sequence: it\\'s sex and death as irresistible surface and sheen.Skyfall stands out by bringing Bond into a real world milieu. For many reasons, things aren\\'t so comfortable and secure anymore.Whether Mr. Mendes is deploying an explosion or a delectable detail, he retains a crucially human scale and intimacy, largely by foregrounding the performers.More than anything, Skyfall is about the Bond girls. They\\'ve come a long way, baby. Fully-formed, strong-thinking, and smart, pivotal characters, Skyfall focuses firmly on M, and rookie Eve.Some of it is terrific. And some of it is spectacular.Take the plunge. Bond is back, and so is high-octane entertainment.I\\'m happy to report that Bond is back, and he\\'s bad. And that\\'s good.The stripped-down, slightly grittier feel of the movie carries us along - and, perhaps, even announces a direction for the series that\\'s both new to young fans and as old as \"From Russia With Love.With stunning cinematography from Roger Deakins, a stirring music score by Thomas Newman and another charismatic villain from Bardem, SKYFALL ranks as one of the best Bonds yet.Outlandishly ambitious, this sure-footed re-boot isn\\'t just among the best of the Bond series, but among the best movies of the year.The best Bond movie in decades.Bardem\\'s Silva is a throwback to a more traditional Bond villain, with equal parts creepy sensuality, intelligence, and psychopathy, and a touch of physical deformity for good measure.This is a brilliant reboot of the canon, mixing a sense of melancholy, the shock of changing times and the darkness of loss with thrillingly staged chase and fight scenes and clever references to all that has come before.Skyfall has the feel of both a ceremonial commemoration and a franchise-rebooting celebration ...Skyfall can take its place alongside From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service as the best Bond can offer.Mendes and Deakins are so busy trying to be visionary that they don\\'t notice that characters are wandering too far from their roots, and half the time you can\\'t see what\\'s going on.These are truly tedious stakes for an action movie. The franchise isn\\'t worried about world safety. It\\'s fretting over whether to start wearing Depends.This is Bond as interpreted by the British director Sam Mendes and shot by the renowned cinematographer Roger Deakins, and one of the first things that strike you is how sumptuous it looks.Casino Royale remains the best of the recent Bonds, with Skyfall just a notch below it.A super-suave but softer Bond, with Craig barely wrinkling his gorgeous suits. Bardem, as a dandyish villain, works up a good, greasy sweat.Skyfall\" is so good you almost forget it is a James Bond movie.With the onset of the sublime Skyfall, Daniel Craig officially wrests the title of \"Best Bond Ever\" from Connery, the British bulldog delivers a brilliant, bulldozing performance in a cinematic spectacular more streamlined than one of his Tom Ford suits.A series that gloried in wit, irony and sex has been reduced to a generic spy thriller.The emphasis here is on the human factor...this is a movie that\\'s as much about what happens between the action as the action itself.Skyfall represents the new standard in one of cinema\\'s longest running franchises. It is a deeply personal, exquisitely shot film that had me mesmerized from the opening scene.Parental figures and familial legacy are central to the importance and impact of Sam Mendes\\' story and Ian Fleming\\'s stylish protagonist becomes a more real but no less exciting figure because of it.Aptly demonstrates you can have a blockbuster of thematic depth and emotional significance that is still loads of fun.Better brace yourself for the best Bond episode in ages, thanks to Daniel Craig\\'s coming of age to make the role his own.SKYFALL has everything you love about Bond from yesteryear; and infuses the modern elements that resuscitated the character.A new Bond film, we are assured in the closing credits, is on its way -- Skyfall provides reasons to look forward to more.Thrilling, sexy, and beautifully photographed.Conveys the melancholy of loss, mortality, and future-shock anxiety, while at the same time leaving us plenty of space to enjoy one of the most complexly unhinged villains in Bond history.Not only one of the best James Bond movies in the five-decade history of the beloved character but it\\'s one of the best action movies of the last decade. The best Bond film since I don\\'t know what ... never less than gripping.Few things get better with age. Among the things that do: a good Scotch and, in his latest incarnation, Bond... James Bond.Craig manages to get out of the shadow of Connery.Skyfall abounds with bum notes and unfortunate compromises. But Mendes has found many fresh things to do with this dusty old machine.Skyfall doesn\\'t have the layers it needs to strut so casually for so long. Bond\\'s latest is a remarkable high watermark for the series: at once solemn and deeply funny, sexy and sad, self-conscious without all the rib-bruising elbowing.Bond really is back.Mendes wants to combine a Bourne-like lack of quips and frippery with Christopher Nolan-ish solemnity and gigantism ...Skyfall is a brilliant Bond.Mendes and his team have done an extremely canny job of combining old-school Bond with new innovations, showing respect for the series\\' heritage while also delivering some audacious surprises.... director Sam Mendes manages to pay sophisticated, sincere homage to the conventions that define the Bond series while remembering that one of the things that makes the series such an enduring presence is fun.It\\'s exhilarating, in a violent sort of way. It\\'s witty. And it\\'s completely engaging. One hell of an action movie. But yes, its goals are high enough, and perhaps even misguided enough, that meeting them may create some potential problems for the franchise.Squint at Skyfall and you\\'ll swear you\\'re watching Bruce WayneEvery time a Bond fan extols the virtues of the Bond films I wish I could see what they saw. I finally have, and I saw it in SKYFALL.Overall, Skyfall is an accomplished action movie which allows Bond a little more psychological complexity and stronger emotional beats. While Skyfall might explore the past, its real success is in looking to the future; the movie promises that James Bond will return, and, as a result, the whole franchise feels re-energized, relevant and ready for action.Enthralling, explosive and often very funny, Skyfall doesn\\'t just exceed expectations but shatters them.Nothing can beat a landmark, classic James Bond picture. They don\\'t come around all that often. The real question is not if, but when, you should see this film, and the answer would be as soon as physically possible - before somebody spoils the twist...It won\\'t diminish Sam Mendes\\' extraordinary achievement to say that those wanting a Bond film by way of Christopher Nolan shan\\'t be disappointed. The pleasure is all ours, James.The Daniel Craig era comes of age with a ballsy Bond that takes brave chances and bold risks. Guess what? Turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks.For all the pre-release chatter of Skyfall being \\'Bond with a capital B\\', steeped in \\'a magical Goldfinger feel\\', it\\'s a film that fights surprisingly shy of the franchise\\'s time-honoured rites.By keeping the plot relatively simple, Mendes has given himself room to expand the characters, lend them a certain depth and just have a bit of fun.A Bond movie that boldly struts forward while looking back over its shoulder to the past.Mendes\\'s film certainly stands out, and there\\'s a sense that things may be slightly different from now on. This is no reboot, more a recalibration of the format, or perhaps even, as Bond himself deftly puts it, \"a resurrection\".It\\'s Premium Bond.If not a full blown triumph, this is certainly one of the best Bonds in recent memory.The new outlook, fresh cast and leaner chassis suggest that the franchise can really kick on from here, but it\\'s hard not to feel that Skyfall itself is something of a missed opportunity. Better luck next time, James. Again.It\\'s outlandish fun, dramatic and exciting, too - pure entertainment with a capital E.Pointedly eschews the spy gadgetry of earlier Bond films to focus on human circuitry.Skyfall could be the most enjoyable Bond yet. One thing\\'s for certain; Bond has never scrubbed up better. Tom Ford now exists to make Daniel Craig suits.The Bond movie every James Bond fan, new or old, will want to see.Skyfall is still a vast improvement on Quantum Of Solace, but it\\'s no Casino Royale.Skyfall isn\\'t just a great Bond film, it\\'s the character\\'s resurrection.Feels more seriously connected to real-world concerns than any previous entry, despite the usual outlandish action scenes, glittering settings and larger-than-life characters.Thrilling opening sequence with implausible feats of derringdo? Check. Scenery chewing psychopathic villain? Check.Works terrifically well up to a point.Skyfall shakes together familiar elements of the Ian Fleming canon - the cars, the guns, the exotic locales with the dames to match - into a blistering comic book escapade that the old Bond, and one suspects Fleming too, would find altogether alien.Undoubtedly Daniel Craig\\'s best outing; this is a new kind of Bond film....has half the racing scenes, twice the plot and none of the Vin Diesel.Loads up on colors, cars and characters to distract from what\\'s missing under the creative hood, yet this spirited sequel is fun as it rarely takes itself too seriously.Death by sequel. Extremely violent sequel.The philosophy here is when you can\\'t make high art, make high trash....ultimately doesn\\'t fare as well as its mediocre predecessor...I\\'d go so far as to say that if you really liked this film, you have a career working in fast food to look forward to. Get it? Fast food?... it provides enough sexy rides, blacktop fury, screeching hairpin turns and crashes to keep the celluloid humming ...This is not a movie about people. It\\'s about cars going very, very fast.It\\'s all curiously rote, though: The cars go really fast, and then, for a change, they go really, really fast.Just because you give an old car a new paint job doesn\\'t mean it runs better.Whatever charms the first one had, the sequel badly misses the Diesel-injection.The film relies on kinetic energy as its entertainment hook. There is plenty of action, no doubt, but hardly any of it inventive.The movie is not going to bring many new fans to the following, but hey -- it gots colour, speed and sparks.Its engines-without-attitude approach isn\\'t just boring, it establishes Singleton as the anti-Walter Hill.If you feel the need for speed in John Singleton\\'s sluggish sequel to The Fast and the Furious then remember: just say no.If the souped up, day-glo cars could have driven themselves, the movie could easily have done without the actors.Singleton\\'s movie is as ingenious as a cop in a car chase movie.Not a good movie or a consistently solid action flick, but it is a big step up. I guess that\\'s not much of a compliment considering what it is an improvement over, but take it for what it\\'s worth.... The quintessence of the mainstream summer sequel: loud, slick, preposterous and thoroughly disposable, where any potentially damaging sugar of invention is quickly, safely flushed out of its engine so the machinery of manipulation and the Law of DiminA genuine guilty pleasure.Director John Singleton once promised greatness with Boyz N the Hood. Here he\\'s going through the paces with a story that was old by the second season of Miami Vice.Walker and Tyrese go for a no-frills style, giving the antiheroic protagonists solid emotional underpinnings before all the fancy driving gets started.A feature-length demolition derby custom-made for members of MADD - Moviegoers with Attention Deficit Disorder.Like Smokey and the Bandit for a younger, more fly, urban generation.About as anachronistic and generic as an action sequel could be.Worth seeing only if you\\'ve seen all the better movies now in release.A summer movie that offers sporadic thrills and spills with nothing but dead air surrounding them.It\\'s about as lightweight as a cars-and-crime action movie should be.It makes you wonder if this trip was really necessary.Singleton\\'s \"Baby Boy\" discovery, Tyrese, steps on the gas and leaves former star Diesel in the dust.Where\\'s Roger Corman when you need him?A disappointing step downward ... betraying what simple vision the original film had.It\\'s a terrible movie, stuck in plot idiocies and big, noisy set pieces like a tire mired in mud.Never title a movie the same way a junior high girl signs her yearbook.A fun enough ambiguously gay carsploitation flick even though it\\'s instantly forgettable.This John Singleton-directed sequel provides a breezy enough joyride,but it lacks the unassuming freshness of the economy-priced original.Just another retread.How could we possibly reconnect with the primal urges of speed-demon street racers, without Vin\\'s din? The answer, in two words: Vroom. Vroom.Superficial? You betcha. But eye candy, attitude and humor abound in what amounts to a glorified Miami Vice episode complete with an undercover lawman who lives aboard a boat.Nothing says summer film fun like explosions, guns and cartwheeling cars -- and that\\'s all here.It\\'s fun. That\\'s all.The pic is closer to the PlayStation experience of Gran Turismo than to a movie. This is not to say that it isn\\'t fun, only to say that it is more about sensation than sense.It\\'s not every movie that would announce its shortcomings right in its title.We expect Pamela Anderson and her VIP crew to come traipsing out in their high heels and cheap props. It\\'s a shame they don\\'t -- the film would be significantly improved.Without Diesel, there\\'s not much gas, at least not from the nonvehicular elements.A film for people who like really loud car sounds, who get breathless when tires squeal and clutches pop, who dream of a special button near the steering wheel that takes your lemon- yellow Skyline from super fast to super super fast.Still as high-octane the second time around, even if it\\'s firing on a few different cylinders.Singleton has a great visual sense, but he seems to be overthinking the action, and the result is an almost studious approach that tames the wildness of his stunts.What\\'s not to like about a movie where the actors are as model-perfect as the cars?Essentially a series of street races.Even if you resist recklessness, these car catharses surge with noise, energy and adrenaline.A mediocre film that could have been much worse.A chaotic blur of a movie with only one discernible objective: to rev the idling engines of a mostly youthful audience.Even more of a joy ride than the original.Has its fair share of adrenaline, but the plot is shot through with more holes than Christina Aguilera\\'s favorite awards outfit.It\\'s pure formula from start to finish, but that was obviously the goal from start to finish.It doesn\\'t have a brain in its head, but it\\'s made with skill and style and, boy, is it fast and furious.. . . pretty enjoyable if you look at it as the B-movie it really ought to be, rather than the E-ticket major studio release it actually is.Director John Singleton seems to have finally found his niche: meaningless movies full of girls in tiny outfits and boys in tiny cars.This is better -- though less culturally interesting -- than the movie that inspired it.Energetic if empty sequel.Very, very cool and very, very dumb.It\\'s ridiculous and knows it. It\\'s the Dukes of Hazzard for the rave/glowstick generation.A crude, sloppy, four-wheeled extravaganza; the best thing about this sequel is that it\\'s not quite as bad as its ridiculous title indicates.It\\'s far too lazy to explore any new levels of stupidity. It\\'s happy to simply loll around on the surface, recapturing already charted levels of stupidity.You would think the producers would have hired a director who could put together an exciting action sequence and not the guy who made a hash of Shaft.For those who were less than impressed with The Fast and the Furious, the sequel offers up some kinetics much more in keeping with the franchise title.The movie delivers what it should -- cheap thrills -- and serves them up with skill and economy.The ride looks tricked out, but it sure is clunky under the hood.For the DVD special edition, they might consider removing everything but the races and chases, including its Smokey and the Bandit scramble; fast-forwarding may be just too much effort.About as anachronistic and generic as an action sequel could be.Plays like an unusually bad, overblown episode of Miami Vice, and has virtually none of the pleasures of the original....doomed to the dreaded obscurity of films so bad, they don\\'t even get made fun of on Saturday Night Live.It\\'s as much of a guilty pleasure as the loud, adrenaline-fueled original -- maybe more so because it yields even lower expectations.Charged with exhilarating car-racing sequences, this movie nails the car culture scene and packages it into an entertaining summer movie.Cars-and-consumerism action flick has John Singleton behind the wheel but no Diesel in the tank, making for a lackluster blockbuster sequel.When you long for the fantasy of what Hal Needham could have brought to the material, you get the picture.What Paul Walker needed was a stunt double. To stand in for him the entire movie.It\\'s unapologetic hackwork aimed at guys who never forgave Mom for throwing out their Hot Wheels set.Instead of the multi-everything family that races, parties and thieves together, Singleton unleashes spasms of sadism and innumerable leering shots of girls gone wild, albeit -- alas -- not behind the wheel.Splashy, shallow entertainment that delivers most of what its audience expects.The film has enough wild driving to satisfy any French Connection fan or Bullitt buff, but there\\'s precious little for anyone else to enjoy.Many too many close-ups of feet slamming down on pedals, hands shifting gears, and eyes narrowing meaningfully in the rear-view mirror. I am the one who is furious at having to sit through this dumb movie.nothing more than a drive-in movie with a bigger than usual budget ... the plot is custom-made for long breaks at the concession counter, and the dialogue is anything but unleaded.This shaggy-dog sequel is ultimately satisfying for the most low-tech of reasons: The competitive bond between the two central characters.Unless you\\'re a car nut or big fan of camp, steer clear.The cars are a rockin\\' and even the friggin\\' movie screen felt like it was shaking as the cars flew by.A satisfying adrenaline rush, it is a mindless bit of escapism that speaks to the inner teenage rebel in us all.Strong off the starting line, it stalls before reaching the second reel due to a distinct lack of \"Diesel\" power.This unabashedly meaningless affair wholeheartedly subscribes to the more-is-better recipe for cinematic second installments.When the ride looks and feels as smooth as this, it\\'s practically irrelevant to complain about any lack of so-called substance.An example of what can happen when the lowest common denominator meets a director in sulky decline.Sometimes you\\'ll laugh with the film, sometimes at it, and sometimes you\\'ll be fumbling for the seatbelt.nannannannannannannannannannannannannannannanIn the end, our arrogant hero is humbled and must face the fact that he has cut himself off from real feeling, the same with our heroine. Meeting each other has rendered all their tactics useless, and they stumble blind and grateful into each others arms.Under- whelming, and predictable cookie cutter romantic comedy fluff...Will Smith charms again; best for teens and up.In a movie where the film\\'s trailer has spoiled all its best scenes, and the onscreen chemistry between our primary lovebirds is a failed experiment, it\\'s refreshing that \"Hitch\" still provides that rare buoyant romantic lift that the genre promises.Does everyone fall in love after the third date? In his world, they do.It\\'s a fantasy that will fill box-office coffers, but it makes for a movie that\\'s a little too innocuous for its own good.full review in GreekFans of movies like The Wedding Planner and You\\'ve Got Mail looking for a charming date movie with lots of laughs will fall in love with Hitch.Does a fine job of staying away from an overage of boredom and sentimentality while providing a good mix of laughter along the way.For what it is, Hitch gets the job done.Smith\\'s knockout comic performance, with its perfect pitches and pauses, ultimately saves the day.Harmless fun for the dating crowd.Sometimes cotton candy tastes really yummy, pop songs are fun for the ears, and movies like Hitch can make for a breezy good time.James comes crashing nervously into the movie like a fat guy who went through the wrong door and ended up on the fashion show catwalk. He\\'s perfect.Will Smith may be on the poster, and he may be the catalyst, but Kevin James is the star and heart and soul of this movie.All that\\'s left is Smith\\'s considerable charm and James\\'s appealing goofiness - and they\\'re not enough.Sure, it has its precious moments -- but Hitch has the smarts to defuse them with large doses of slapstick, wit, or outright silliness.The film is largely well-designed fantasy that is fun and entertaining.Those who have seen enough of these films - and who know all their tricks - will likely recognize that Hitch is nothing special.Works as a capsule -- a snapshot -- of what American metropolitan dating has become: a game of social defense.Hitch will make dorky, husky guys like Kevin James and myself feel some hope that we too can date women who look like modelsWith it\\'s share of Jerry Maguire moments mixed with real romance corn, Hitch is well worth the date. Enjoyable romantic comedy that is sharply written and frequently laugh-out-loud funny, thanks to a hilarious performance by supporting actor Kevin James.James is a gleeful crackup opposite Smith.Hitch isn\\'t a memorable date.Merely cute when it could be affecting, pleasant when it could be relevant.Reminds us, sweetly, charmingly, and humorously, what Will Smith used to be like before he became an overnight action sensation.While the last act of the film is kind of forced, most of it is just perfect....good date film........laugh yourself silly as Will Smith and Kevin James make up the screen\\'s most unlikely comic duo since Schwarzenegger and DeVito in \"Twins\".Say what you \"Will\", but Mr. Smith is one entertaining guyWhat this comedy lacks in cleverness or originality it more than makes up for with charm.I didn\\'t expect much from Hitch and, not surprisingly, I didn\\'t get much -- but I was entranced by the film nonetheless, from a historical perspective.Dating is difficult. Relationships can be tough. \"Hitch\" wants to be the Band-Aid that heals the wound.Romantic comedy is to cinema what hot dogs are to cuisine - the question is only whether it\\'s been prepared decently. And this one has.Hitch claims to spit on the importance of coded language in relationships. But these are only nice asides; the film is too comfortable with the rom-com statusquo.Agreeable if not exactly good.... while both of these performers look great together, they really don\\'t seem to belong together.Only has one thing going for it and that\\'s Will Smith, but that\\'s enough.Kevin James is the film\\'s greatest asset by far.A half-hearted attempt at a Valentine\\'s Day date movie. Blind dates are one thing, but dumb and blind movies are another.Smith and Mendes, unfortunately, fizzle rather than spark, a near-fatal flaw in a romance that depends on its leads\\' chemistry to succeed.Hitch falls predictably in place, but it throws surprises out along the way and has surprising substance.Hitch wastes both Will Smith and Kevin James with yet another convoluted romantic fableWill Smith began his acting career as a prince, and he remains one of the most engaging, adorable actors on the planet.Smith has another hit, James beats pal Ray Romano to movie stardom, and acting lessons pay off for a supermodel. With involving performance by Will Smith and Eva Mendes this Valentine romancer is certainly worth seeing. Andy Tennant may be the best marketing guru in Hollywood. It\\'s too bad he\\'s directing HitchWill Smith and Kevin James keep the whole thing going thanks to the chemistry of their oddball pairingIt won\\'t change your life, but it will keep you happily entertained for a couple hours.For a fairly typical romantic comedy, Hitch is a mildly entertaining diversion that ultimately becomes engulfed in its formulaic trappings.To play off of the Heavy D/Aaron Hall classic, now that Smith has found a love story, what is Hollywood gonna do with him? I look forward to finding out.Hitch falls into that weird gray area of movies I sort of liked, but sort of didn\\'t.I did enjoy the buddy dynamic between Smith and James, who puts kind of a cocky spin on the clumsy fat guy cliches. And there were about a half-dozen jokes that had me laughing out loud.Hitch has us from hello.Hitch doesn\\'t impress with its sophomoric observations on sexual politics.This lighter than air souffle offers little beyond Will Smith\\'s currently palatable magnetism.Looks like another love TKO.It runs out of gas about halfway through and becomes just another sitcom with silly sight gags replacing the clever dialogue.Although somewhat predictable, labored and gimmicky, Tennant\\'s narrative is given a boisterous boost by its charismatic leading rogue in Will Smith.A smart romantic comedy and a fabulous showcase for its leads and New York City setting.Smith is the stale prince of charming grins and adorable asides; it\\'s astounding that this is his first real romantic comedy, because it feels like he\\'s been doing this shtick for years.Having conquered Independence Day, Will Smith has set his sights on Valentine\\'s Day.Hitch is light and funny for audiences in an undemanding mood.Hitch isn\\'t the \\'cure for the common man,\\' as its tagline suggests; but it\\'s definitely the cure for the common.Smith and James make such an inspired comedic team ... that the movie\\'s conventional romances can\\'t possibly match the spark these two generate.This is as formulaic a comedy as humanly possible. Smith\\'s charm and his collaberation with James produce enough laughs to save it from terminal derivativity....several stories form a funny tapestry that is well woven by helmer Andy Tennant.A likable love story that keeps you engaged even when it\\'s tearing a few dog-eared pages out of the romantic comedy playbook.Smith and Mendes are terrific together. He brings her game up so high you\\'d think she has had as many good parts as Smith.Smith, of course, is so cool he can afford to pretend to be uncool; but what really works for him here is the interplay with James, whose inner-wild-man dance moves alone are worth the price of admission.In my view, Smith would do well to tweak his career a bit. How nice if he\\'d find a small, serious movie that tests his acting chops. Can the action heroes. Scrap the charm.Manages time and again to deliver familiar notes that it then jazzes up.Smith has more comic charisma with James than Mendes, not that there\\'s anything wrong with that.Here\\'s hoping this first romantic comedy won\\'t be his last. Or the best.Will Smith has always had an easy time grabbing the spotlight.Virtually hitch-free, making it a true cinema valentine.You can almost see the filmmakers flailing their arms, desperately manufacturing contrivance upon contrivance to separate and reunite the movie\\'s unlikely pair.More like a skit that doesn\\'t know when to pack it in.Will Smith proves that if he ever wants to stop fighting screen robots, aliens or drug dealers, he is more than able to fill the rom-com leading-man shoes.This is the sort of role Smith carries off effortlessly, a decent, level-headed all-American guy who\\'s more sensitive than his imposing physique might suggest.It\\'s amiable enough, but it\\'s likely that even the easiest-to-please of viewers won\\'t be overly impressed.Lame mistaken identity subplots are a staple of romantic comedy, but this one is intrusive and clunky by any standard.The streamlined plot is nothing new, but the physical comedy and trademark Smith glibness work their charm.It\\'s a good script, packed with knowing zingers about the game of love.If the muddy romantic comedy Hitch gives the hope of a Smith freed from computerized trickery and ludicrous shoot-outs, it\\'s still not the ideal vehicle for its star\\'s talents.It is smarter than your average rom-com and boasts some genuine pathos towards the end. The movie certainly has enough commendable qualities to earn referrals from dating gurus.Most of the credit goes to Smith, who is wonderfully at-ease in everything he does and here he effortlessly carries the movie.Even though a little less Hitch might have been a better thing, the Fresh Prince keeps the proceedings from becoming too stale.Faint praise it may be, but those looking for a cute date movie this weekend could do far worse. As could Smith, for that matter.There are enough laughs, winning performances, attractive people and appealing romance to make Hitch an amusing option for the Valentine season.Smith, with one tweak or twinkle too much, could become too smug, too princely, but is almost totally appealing.Director Andy Tennant and screenwriter Kevin Bisch establish a breezy tone and offer up a New York that exists only in the movies, in the best, most escapist sense.A rare studio product that earns the goodwill it smugly demands.When it\\'s funny, it\\'s truly funny and the featured couples all have an easy and believable chemistry.Forget about the predictable twists: Hitch works best when it\\'s a buddy comedy, with Smith and James having a blast as smooth Yoda and jiggly Jedi.From the very opening, when Hitch begins explaining to the camera that love sometimes needs an outside assist to get started, he owns the audience.To enjoy this film, it helps to check your brain at the box office.In the end, the two halves of the movie feel as if they are forced together, leaving messes that Tennant and screenwriter Kevin Bisch never really clean up.It\\'s puzzling that Smith has taken this long to try a romantic comedy.Marvelous Will Smith and his mostly watchable supporting cast soldier on bravely, but they\\'re marching straight into quicksand.The premise is intriguing, and for a time it seems that the Date Doctor may indeed know things about women that most men in the movies are not allowed to know, but the third act goes on autopilot just when the Doctor should be in.All of the funniest bits from \"Hitch\" are in the trailer, what\\'s left is a sweet, down to earth romantic comedy with a really likable cast.This is surprisingly funny - it has a great opening and closing montage; both quickly establish the story and mood of the movie... Will Smith swept us all off our feet.Every so often you simply want a movie set in movie-land, featuring attractive people saying things that, if not witty, at least don\\'t need a laugh track to prop them up, and you want it to play fair within the context of its tiny universe.A sweet, slick, streamlined yet, ultimately, forgettable ploy in the game of love...a klutzy, long-winded, far-fetched and not-all-that-funny affair that somehow flashes an unobjectionable charm when expectations are kept low.The magnetic chemistry of the actors ... elevates the story\\'s familiar rhythms above leagues of imitators.... Adds up to far more than the formula typically allows.Like eager kids on their first date, this romantic comedy stumbles and fumbles at times but its heart is definitely in the right place. Sometimes that\\'s just enough.[Writer] Bisch... has a fairly dim view of humanity... as easily manipulated automatons...The date doctor operates like an overly eager comic intern. That\\'s the only real glitch in Hitch. Hitch skates by on appeal and indefatigability of effort.A romantic comedy that\\'s easy to fall in love with....a facile, undemanding romantic comedy elevated from formula dreck by the considerable charisma of Will SmithWill Smith\\'s charisma helps make this sweet, slight romantic comedy about a modern Cupid a light and disposable pleasure.Will Smith is a remarkable talent, his reactive comic timing a thing of beauty.Hitch will make a great date movie.If Alex Hitchens were a green thumb, he\\'d probably be called Alex Gardner. If he were a cook, he\\'d probably be Alex O\\'Spatchula...But that\\'s how romantic comedies work.It\\'s just too bad that Smith wanted to play it so safe and so easy when Hitch could\\'ve benefited from a stronger vision and much bigger laughs.A standard-issue rom-com in almost every respect, but the irresistible charm of its lead pushes it over the top.Screenwriter Kevin Bisch emphasizes tired jokes and stock situations over anything resembling reality, something that\\'s exacerbated by a seriously overlong running time.Knows its formula well enough to run its finger along the grooves quick and smooth.Smith carries it off with his effortless charm and confidence, whether he\\'s chatting up a woman, conspiring with the audience, or instructing a client, and director Andy Tennant gives it a light gloss and an easy lilt.The film moves in fits and starts, and is way too long, but it may prove memorable, if only for the sweet, marvelously inventive performance of Kevin James.A pleasant date movie with several laughs and a couple of smiles. Smith is a gifted comic actor, and seeing him in a lighthearted comedy, his first romantic lead, is a pure pleasure.How reassuring to realize that happy surprises are still possible. Hitch is one of the happiest.Not so much movie as antidote -- to the cynicism that\\'s rampant in most Hollywood romantic comedies.Too many false endings and time issues aside, Hitch is difficult to discount when it handles the rom-com formula better than most of its insufferably dumbed-down ilk.An average romantic comedy, starring Will Smith and Eva Mendes, that is as soft and sweet as a marshmallow, and about as interesting.You know what\\'s being fed to you and yet you slurp it down just the same.Smith and sexy Mendes spar nicely, but they don\\'t spark. In movies, that\\'s the kiss of death.The sour subplot, in which Sara\\'s dark side mistakes Hitch for a cad, staggers to a gummy resolution, throwing a wet-blanket reminder that romantic comedy -- indeed, romance itself -- isn\\'t what it used to be.For women, it purveys the dream that men really, really care about what they think. For men, it holds out the fantasy that babes are attracted to geeky men who really, really care about what they think. What\\'s not to like?Hitch suffers from a good-joke deficit that even Smith\\'s charm has trouble balancing.Andy Tennant, Will Smith and Kevin James have managed to deliver a decent comedy out of a one-note idea.James and Smith are terrific together.The romantic comedy genre needs infusion of new blood, but this film is utterly predictable, by-the-number, thoigh Will Smith has charm. It\\'s an equal-opportunity fizzle.A little like being on a blind date. Bits of it are charming, much of it is awkward and several sequences plod along with the self-consciousness of a first-date stop-and-start conversation.Will Smith finally makes the leap into romantic comedies with the delightful if somewhat predictable Hitch. Will, baby, what took you so long?a pleasant enough meringue of a romantic comedy. Light, sweet, and essentially insubstantialSmith charms his way through piled-on platitudes and social faux-pas\\' with his groove intact.Forget Will Smith and Eva Mendes. You\\'ll hope for a hook-up on future films between Smith and the very funny Kevin James. Their chemistry saves an otherwise mediocre movie.Men may be from Mars, and women from Venus, but Hitch hails from the planet GetMeSome.A bright and sharp-witted -- if predictable -- romantic comedy.A warm and witty comedy that unfortunately runs itself into the ground during its final act.It makes nerds and studs alike so noble that it turns the chase into a neutered game.It is a romantic comedy, released for Valentine\\'s weekend no less, that is willing to look at the darker underside of datingthe makers of Hitch - a film that overstays its welcome by a good half-hour - seem to be the only filmmakers in Hollywood to not know how to put together a fast happy endingBy the time Smith offers up his unnecessary race-against-the-clock mea culpa, Hitch\\'s cupid\\'s arrow has already veered way off course.Good performances pump up the fun in this lively romantic comedy.The real chemistry isn\\'t between Smith and Mendes, it\\'s between Smith and James.Like a big box of Valentine\\'s chocolates that turn out to be a mite stale when you bite into them.Everything about Hitch seems off.This is a very entertaining picture.Will Smith is pure delight, as if we didn\\'t know.An urban fantasy, with florid observations about life and love...Sometimes, competent direction and a brace of star power are enough.the kind of romantic comedy that even the most unromantic lout in your life will enjoy.Hitch is infinitely preferable to rooting for Jennifer Lopez to find love with her feather duster again or watching Meg Ryan pretend not to age.nannannannannannannannanThe level of detail is awe-inspiring, and originality and charm oozes from every pixel.Rango is quite beautiful in its harsh, perverse way.Rango is a new stoner cult classic in the making.The weirdness of the film is fascinating, but there\\'s just so damn much of it.Delivers the western genre goods along with generous laughs and some impressive animation--and some brazenly warped sensibilities.Amusing in small doses, marketed to kids and not really FOR kids. An undeserving Oscar winner.Meditations on identity make Rango unique, and somewhat special, in the current animated film landscape.If the writers had dared to step a little outside the borders of the western formula or if they\\'d even just shaken up the old formula a bit, this really could have been something special, but sadly, it just ends up being pretty standard.Depp isn\\'t as annoying in this as he has been elsewhere.Packed with in-jokes, great characters and an offbeat anti-hero, Rango is the perfect shake-up the animated genre needed.At long last, a spaghetti Western for the kiddie set -- and one that doesn\\'t sell older viewers short.Oddball existential western animation.An animated walk on the dry sideUnfocused and absolutely scattered...... The best non-Pixar animated movie in recent memory ...Set in a surreally off-kilter version of the Wild West populated entirely by animals, computer-animated Western Rango is both a witty spoof and loving homage to the genre.Kudos to the director for making it as oddball as it could get away with.... this southwestern goof is really for really big kids with a love of movies, a sense of whimsy and a soft spot for the hideously gorgeous creatures of the desert. It\\'s one of those movies that will reveal more and more to youngsters as they rewatch it in years to come... and that\\'s the best kind of film.For good or for bad, this is not your run-of-the-mill animated feature.Rango is Disney by way of Hunter S. Thompson, Chinatown recast with a lizard, Blazing Saddles with existential angst, Sergio Leone\\'s spaghetti westerns romanticallyspoofed. Rango is both weird and wonderful.Inevitably, as seems to be the law with any modern animation, there\\'s an intertextual dimension to the proceedings.This chameleon stands out.Rango is as gloriously cinematic as it is witty and ironic.OK, kids, who\\'s ready for an animated version of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\"?Sergio Leone meets Chuck JonesA third act cameo sets a high water mark of awesome, especially for fans of Deadwood.If ever there was an animated film made for film critics, Rango is it.The kind of computer animation that lingers so exquisitely on the little things. The romance is sweetly underplayed and Coen-like moments of hyper-erudition and eccentric, grizzled characters make for a rollicking escapade.A smart, satirical, and expertly animated adventure aimed at adults and children alike....reminds one of how special animation can be.Brilliantly bonkers, this animated Western weirdo should scare little kids while dazzling adults with its inspired approach to demented homage.Inventive visuals and lively voice cast lift this finely animated film above the fray. So it\\'s a shame that the story feels both random and predictable.Any serious, dark-minded child who\\'s up on High Noon, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Chinatown, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the writings of Carlos Castaneda will really find their precociousness rewarded.\\'Rango\\' is one of the best works of literature I\\'ve enjoyed for many years. \\'Rango\\' is one of the best family films I\\'ve seen in years. \\'Rango\\' is one of the best Westerns I\\'ve ever seen.Going in, I was expecting much more standard children\\'s fare, not an existential undertaking with shout-outs to everything from Chinatown to Don Quixote. Just when you thought you\\'d seen everything, here comes Chinatown, the animated version.It would be unfair, and inaccurate, to call Rango a one-joke movie. There may be two or three; I didn\\'t count. The first laugh comes with the appearance of a... Rango is a precision-built, artistically rich and intelligently entertaining movie that deserves to become a hit and a classic.Rango\" has everything going for it -- strong characters, complex plotting, and a knowledge of the genre it parodies without excluding newcomers to it. It\\'s smart without being alienating and exciting without being mindless. Channeling spaghetti westerns, Cervantes, Castaneda, and a dash of CHINATOWN as refracted through the visual sensibilities of Dali, it is a fiendishly clever concretion of high- and low-brow in a story that is both vision quest and farceQuick-witted animated Western spoof gets plenty mileage out of good writing, a grand sense of fun, and the voice of Johnny Depp.Rango a dynamic tribute to a lost genre.Sergio Leone meets \\'The Shakiest Gun in the West\\' in this odd movie about a chameleon who -- credit the filmmakers for their cleverness -- doesn\\'t blend in.A welcome change from formula as it travels on tangents that vary from the crazed to the surrealThere is never a doubt Rango will succeed by film\\'s end, but the movie does have its charms. Boasts a richer, stranger cinematic flavor than anything in Verbinski\\'s Pirates of the Caribbean moviesThough young children may enjoy it, the film is built for viewers of any age with a taste for joyful anarchy.what it loses in coherence and dexterity it gains in pure sensationalism, whether it be visual, verbal, or narrativeWhat a joy to see an original vision constructed with so much passion and smarts.If the art of the mashup is what passes for originality these days, then Rango is a creative tour de force. Existential, inventive and irreverentfull review at Movies for the MassesThe stunning overall look -- which tips its ten-gallon hat at western classicists like John Ford and Sergio Leone while winking slyly at Salvador Dali -- qualifies as a work of art in its own right.The film unspools as an admittedly bizarre blending of an animated adventure film for kids and a meta-comedy about a character who must morph from being a fictitious hero to being a real one.Not often does one see an animated family film where someone talks about experiencing a \"paradigm shift\" or says, \"I think your metaphor broke my spleen.\" Very funny, packed with solid action, animated with a remarkable degree of care and creativity, and delivered with a breathless sense of energy.There\\'s absolutely no arguing that it comes from the same mentality of test-marketing and formula and commercial calculation as most American animation does right now.Even if the story about a dust bowl town\\'s diminished water supply isn\\'t quite thrilling enough, the film makes up for it with wacked-out dream sequences and a general oddball toneIn the end, Rango, despite its many pleasures, is a bit too smart for its own good.It\\'s very, very interesting but it\\'s sort of like you\\'ve got to have that magic combination: you\\'ve got to have looks and heart.With its many allusions to other films like Chinatown, The Three Amigos and any number of spaghetti Westerns, Rango seems to have pulled off the Pixar trick of entertaining both young and old.Rango is an impressive and wonderfully strange film.There are some great sight gags and the script has some good lines, but there aren\\'t enough of them - and the plot is rather slight and predictable.The Western isn\\'t dead. It\\'s just become more animated... literally.Fantastical tale of the reptile that conquered the Wild West.Rango is like Chinatown meets A Fistful of Dollars meets a Geico commercial. And it\\'s totally awesome.This one is for Johnny Depp devotees only. The animation is good but the overall effect of the movie is dull.It doesn\\'t know what kind of a film it is.Closer to a comedy for adults than a kids\\' flick, this ground-breaking and simply unmissable animation bursts with creativity, humour and clever references.Minutes into the audaciously animated Rango, I wondered whether someone had slipped peyote into my soft drink... This movie is obviously not right in the head, and I love it.I just don\\'t know if we\\'ll see a film as smart or fun or overwhelmingly rich as Rango for the rest of the year. While the pace of the film is slow, the colorful characters, witty dialog, movie references and beautiful artwork make this a pony ride worth taking.The movie basically adheres to the conventions of the genre as well as the Western spoofs made popular by comedians such as Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, and Mel Brooks in \"Blazing Saddles.Gore Verbinski\\'s sophisticated, extremely amusing CGI animated movie, a cartoon for adults as opposed to an adult cartoon...Who else but Johnny Depp would Gore Verbinski want to voice the character of Rango, given how they worked together to create Jack Sparrow, a Pirate in the Caribbean ... Rango, let\\'s face it, is another colourful character. There\\'s a lot to like about Rango, the colourful, kooky chameleon looking for enlightenment in this unique and imaginative animation that takes the form of a Western, and embraces a zoo of weird and wonderful charactersThis is a smart, hip comedy that works for adults and youngsters alike.These strange looking characters are hard to love. They didn\\'t generate the excitement and enthusiasm that I was hoping for.The film reunites director Gore Verbinski with star Johnny Depp, and just as with their Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration it begins very promisingly before descending into a chaotic mess.There\\'s more visual wit in Gore Verbinski\\'s Rango than the last two Pixar films combined.There are a couple of frightening sequences with a rattlesnake and a hawk that may scare small children, but all ends well. Rango will rope you in.A work that in its finest moments comes across as a Coen Brothers film with anthropomorphic animals instead of flesh-and-blood humans.Admirably ambitious animated ode to Spaghetti Westerns featuring a Johnny Depp-voiced lizard as the unlikely hero....whole-heartedly casts its lot with the grown-ups in the audience, paying homage to Sergio Leone, Carlos Castaneda, Hunter S. Thompson, and Roman Polanski\\'s Chinatown. ...So, let\\'s dispel the illusion that this movie is for kids.It\\'s almost like Sergio Leone was adapting a Kenneth Grahame story.With all of these crazy characters running around and Hans Zimmer\\'s perfect Spaghetti Western score, \"Rango\" is a treat for everyone who enjoys animation. Rango\" is a delight from start to finish, both visually and in its creative writing.Adults and slightly older children should have a great time.The funny and powerfully weird Rango is probably the closest I\\'ve seen a big-budget, computer-animated feature get to the comic vibe of my favorite Chuck Jones cartoons.A CGI western comedy populated by desert critters, Rango gives the film year a belated jump start with a passel of movie-wise fun and a knockout animation style.All in all, Rango is a freaky and fun ride, with some tasty philosophical asides and references for the grownups to chew on. With his first animated feature, Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski shows ambitions considerably beyond producing the usual standard of most children\\'s fare. To put it plainly, Rango is one weird movie.Yes, [there are] enough nods to other sources to make Rango a bobblehead. But the movie, and much of John Logan\\'s writing, is still pretty durn clever.The best of Rango is a lot like the best of the first Pirates movie -- crazily funny and rambunctious.What elevates it above a cheeky romp is the skilled CGI work, not only the wealth of tactile detail lavished on the parched townsfolk but also the painterly, sand-swept vistas they call home.Amusing and thrilling albeit slightly overlong with dazzling visuals and clever nods to classic Westerns. He is \"sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception,\" says the owl who leads a Mexican mariachi band that serves as the story\\'s Greek chorus - a description that shows you just how willfully weird are the goings-on. The humor is dry, dusty and packed with animated caricatures of legendary movie characters. Guns and deep thoughts make this best for older kids.Some good bits about the nature of heroism, but not enough to elevate Rango to the ranks of Pixar. Still, when viewed as a silly comedy-adventure, it\\'s enjoyable.A defiantly weird and unexpectedly charming effort that could easily feel at home at both matinees and on the midnight movie circuit.A delightfully strange, if somewhat inconsistent, animated western.No tightly-plotted Pixar masterpiece, Rango is its own insane expression, a nervy bundle of outrageous daring, jangled and tangled to a free-wheeling fare-thee-well. Green hasn\\'t been this much fun since early Shrek.Parents will be nudging aside their children to check out the thoroughly mature western known as RangoWhether your a fan of film, a fan of animation or just a fan of having fun in the theater Rango is a delight across the board.A damn fine western, an entertaining throwback to classic B-pictures that pays clever tribute to its predecessors.Clear proof that a great director can work in any genre and medium and produce great results.The only thing more astonishing than its subversive sense of humor and general anarchy is the fact that a studio is putting it in wide release.This is one of those movies where the grandiose vision is there, but it never gels.Rango is clever and entertaining. Not for the very young perhaps, but ideal for teens and adults....viewers will eventually find themselves growing tired of the movie\\'s meandering structure and unusually deliberate pace...As animation, this is top class, and a mile away from the orthodox. Some of the detail is terrific, and the screenplay is sharply intelligent.The strangeness is off the scale in a kooky concoction that might have been hatched at the bottom of a bong. Then again, what do you expect with Johnny involved?An ultra-quirky animated Western with a vocal tour de force by Johnny Depp that\\'s quite unlike anything I\\'ve ever seen.A sun-baked symphony of rust and dust, Rango has a spiky, unsentimental appeal, sending out slightly risque jokes to parents while staying safely out of the danger zone for kids.Nothing about this witty, inventive film obeys the rules.What it borrows and what it builds combine to feel original and strange.Frantically and refreshingly fun.One of my favorites of this young year and among the most unique features I\\'ve seen from an American animation house in recent memory.Wry, genial, and not at all interested in jumping on the bandwagon of flash-in-the-pan pop-cultural hipness, \"Rango\" holds an eclectic eye for finding beauty in the unusual.From start to finish this is a wonderful and immensely creative animated film about a loser who arises to the challenges faced in a town without water. There are hundreds of clever details and imaginative flourishes to make it worthy of being put into the same category as the films to which it so charmingly pays tribute. It is Depp, however, who really nails this thing by simply blending in with all the other voice talent and characters and not reverting to the oversized Captain Jack Sparrow swagger.A possible cult hit, it\\'s too self-indulgent to find a mass audience.Verbinski has made an animated feature unlike any other on the current mainstream landscape: For a big-budget animated picture, Rango sure is an odd little varmint.For a movie about finding one\\'s identity, Rango spends an awful lot of time searching for one of its own.The film itself is a magically strange hybrid, a spoofy computer-animated Western acted out by anthropomorphic desert creatures.It is not self-conscious knowingness that drives Rango but rather a quirky and sincere enthusiasm for all the strange stuff that has piled up in the filmmakers\\' heads over the years.Every other week, it seems there is some new creation full of fantastically realized creatures engaging in eye-tricking action. The ironic effect of this... is a so-what-else-you-got state of jaded exhaustion. And then along comes Rango.I\\'ve made a good case for seeing \"Rango,\" and why not; an eye feast is still a feast in this lean multiplex season.Its strong suit is visual panache. It\\'s too bad that consistent comedy and emotional resonance get lost amid the dust and cacti.Say what you will about \\'Rango,\\' the computer-animated Western riding hard on Johnny Depp doing the voice of a lizard - just don\\'t call it business as usual. It\\'s Verbinski\\'s trust in the audience to get his jokes and pop-culture references that makes \"Rango\" such an engaging ride.The film features some of the most astounding computer animation ever, and, thanks to a slew of terrific voice actors who are obviously having a great time, the film is wildly, weirdly amusing.Sharp-edged, surreal, and often astonishing in its giddy creativity.It\\'s an exuberant, audacious love letter to spaghetti westerns, masquerading as a kiddie cartoon. And it delivers deliciously on both levels.What makes this unhinged, wildly self-conscious comedy-adventure more than a two-hour gimmick is an inspired vocal performance by Verbinski\\'s \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star, Johnny Depp.You know those animated films that have bits that the parents will enjoy? Rango is mostly those bits.Verbinski\\'s scored an offbeat oddity, a classic Western with surreal elements and references to films from \"Chinatown\" to \"Star Wars\"...If only he\\'d known when enough is enough...It doesn\\'t always work, but it does set itself resolutely apart from the pack, and if you look closely, you can spot the occasional moment of genius.Rango\\'\\' is a highly watchable but somewhat frustrating mix of sloppy plotting, rascally attitude, and Big Action.Ignoring the weak storyline entirely, Rango is a joyously weird experience, far more concerned with texture and flavor than with elaborate narrative.Consistently plays like an adult movie in uncomfortably fitting family-friendly clothes.Rango is the revitalising injection of new blood that animated cinema didn\\'t know it needed.absolutely wonderfulIt loosens the shackles of a post-Pixar/post-Blue Sky animation landscape, where family entertainment must either be an emotional roller coaster or mindless slapstick.An animated picture that can bear comparison to Pixar\\'s best...In attitude and style it\\'s distinctive and witty, walking a fine line between respectful homage and spoof.Doesn\\'t build to anything substantial, instead dragging along interminably while its sense of humor succumbs to heat exhaustion...a gorgeous picture, but its soullessness wears down the viewing experience.A neon-colored, sun-baked fantasia that\\'s part Western spoof and part surrealist jag through the desert with Johnny Depp as our theatrically unhinged, reptilian tour guide, Rango is anything but your standard kiddie animated flick.Well, visually Rango looks excellent. Then characters start talking.It\\'s all technically brilliant, but maybe lacking a little in charm and true wit.Rango never shuts up, but he never has anything funny or touching or clever to say.I\\'m honestly not sure whether or not it\\'s a good movie, but it doesn\\'t leave you much time to ponder that question.It coasts on strangeness only so long before the novelty wears off.It\\'s a droll and invigorating alternative to the Disney and Dreamworks models. At the same time, you wish that Verbinski had a tighter grip on his storyline.Rango turns out to be a master of adaptability and good will in the end, in fact, an educating and entertaining little ambassador for all with an addictive personality.This digimated all-animal western borders on the inspired.Neither Rango the mash-up movie nor Rango the lizard is particularly lovable. But there\\'s no denying the intrigue in its combination of the good, the bad, and the ugly.Toplined by Johnny Depp, who\\'s in great form, Rango is a thematically witty, visually striking animated Western, a movie that could be enjoyed by younger and mature viewers in different ways.There are some wonderful things in \\'Rango\\': the dialogue is witty, the animation is dizzying and the action is stunningly choreographed.Not many animated escapades aim to please such a broad audience. Even the poo jokes are sophisticated.Visually inventive and enjoyably quirky...It\\'s refreshing to see an animated movie that doesn\\'t look as though the idea for the Happy Meal came first.While Depp turns his bug-eyed reptile into a charismatic character, the plot gets lost in a maze of tangents and the story has too many tasteless jokes -- like a prostate gag -- that are not kid-friendly.Perhaps a new classification has been born: the \"SpaghettiOs Western.An animated homage to western movies-from classic to revisionist, old-fashioned to postmodern--Rango plumbs existential depths and hits movie-lover highs.[W]hat a [Coen Brothers\\'] animated flick might look like and sound like, if they got an assist from Terry Giliam: this is a deeply weird and deeply demented movie, and thrillingly so.Visually, so stunning and clever that you can almost forgive that, really, it\\'s not very funny. Incredibly artful - but its grasp of the art of comedy is unfortunately slight.The most satisfying non-Pixar animated movie to emerge in some time.So weird I can\\'t believe they got to make this movie.A terrific Saturday matinee for pretty much anyone.A rollicking, surreal, and existential kids\\' Western that worships at the altars of Sergio Leone, Hunter S. Thompson, and Chinatown, Rango drowns under the weight of discordant objectives and influences.Rango is the most beautiful animated film since the golden age of hand-drawn cartoons. Shame that the movie has no heart beneath all that beauty, though.Rango feels unhinged at its best moments, like anything might happen, and it\\'s liberating to see such talented people running so absolutely off the rails.Johnny Depp isn\\'t the sort of star to blend in, so it\\'s saying something that his turn as the world\\'s most conspicuous chameleon in Rango is so full-bodied, you forget the actor and focus on the character.Madly clever animated sagebrush saga has style and wit to burn....a fleet, quirky, computer-animated feature that I found ingenious, charming and almost entirely engaging.state-of-the-art animation collides with postmodern pastiche on a busy road along which wayside legend will always count for more than supposed progress.Western myths infuse with the story of a lizard facing an existential crisis. His name? Rango.It\\'s ultimately a pastiche-by-numbers and doesn\\'t live up to its full potential, but as a visual treat and one of Depp\\'s better vehicles of recent years, it delivers the basic goods.Spoofs such kiddie favourites as Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, the mystical writings of Carlos Castaneda, and Sergio Leone\\'s Dollars trilogy.nannannanThe strengths are amazing, and it\\'s pretty impressive how thoroughly and successfully the movie rewrote the vocabulary of action cinema.Second in trilogy is a smooth but violent thriller.More than adequately serves as a no-nonsense escapist action thriller.As Bourne seeks to uncover his past and bury those who would cross him, director Paul Greengrass masterfully blends sight, sound and silence to do much more than entertain: This film leaves a deep psychological imprint.While not as engaging as \"The Bourne Identity,\" the sequel fills a void in the undernourished spy movie genre. What more could you ask for in a sequel?A huge leap of faith is required to connect, and many plot details appear to have not been properly thought through.It is a spy film for adults and it avoids over the top pyrotechnics and jokey one-liners, and instead delivers a mature, intelligent thriller.By the end of the film, we\\'ve more or less given up trying to figure out how the characters are making their deductions; we just have to take it on faith that somehow everyone knows to go to a specific address in Moscow.A thriller with a brain, a grown up film for grown upsFlashes of color and streaks of movement can make for a striking picture, but only if you can see what\\'s taking place, not to mention if you care about who is in jeopardy.Where it could have descended into a revenge drama, it settles for justice instead -- and not the kind that puts down one\\'s enemies, but the kind that calls for confession, even reconciliation.[Director] Greengrass proves himself equally adept at action, building on the edginess of Doug Liman\\'s original with a feverish handheld camera and frenetic editing.Supremacy is, minor quibbles aside, a worthy successor to The Bourne Identity.Stylish, full throttle, nobody\\'s-pretending-this-is-art summer movie fun.At times, it\\'s a bit too much like watching the Zapruder film, but... it keeps the audience sharp by forcing them to search for clues and stay focused on the action.The Bourne Supremacy offers both brains and brawn, but without the ability to enjoy any of the action, the film falls to mediocre levels.Yet another of the all reason-defying examples of sequels that are as good as if not better than their earlier films.Improves on the original by leaps and bounds.Tries to top the original by offering two car chases; but they both chop space into blurry, discontinuous fragments...As with the car chases, so with The Bourne Supremacy.The Bourne Supremacy shows how a spy film should really be done.I\\'m here to tell you that it didn\\'t disappoint.Damon makes Bourne a consistent, driven, intelligent, and yet vulnerable hero. It\\'s too bad Academy voters will fail to notice his fantastic performance.A first-rate thriller that plays out with the pluck and style of the best James Bond films.Like the first film, Supremacy belongs to Damon.

However, jerky camera work is somewhat annoying.The movie culminates with a sloppily edited car chase that goes on for so long that I had to be reminded: Was Matt Damon playing Jason Bourne or Sheriff Buford T.

The pacing is lively, yet still easy to followFans of the original film will certainly be pleased with this sequel.The car chase near the end of the film is one of most exciting shots ever.I was riveted by [the] exhausting hand-to-hand combat and adrenaline-pumping car chases...Dizzying editing and camera work will bother some, and the sheer complexity of the telling will confuse more people.A convoluted concoction of shaky hand-held camera shots and stomach-churning edits meant to simulate the feeling you\\'d get if you were tossed over Niagara Falls in a barrel.Frantic and fresh, \"The Bourne Supremacy\" is a chic spy thriller that\\'s even better than the original.The old-school Cold War spy thriller is Bourne again.Much like Bourne, the film is a lean, mean, killing machine, and the action, near constant, is frightfully good.A smart thriller for a smart audience.The Bourne Supremacy is an exceptional thriller that is a sequel to a good one... Power runs through every frame, making the smallness of the world itself seem scary.I felt like I was Jason Bourne watching the movie, because I was one step ahead of it the entire way through...but even when Bourne is not at his best, he\\'s still impressive.Damon, who carries a certain blankness and anger with him, is right at home playing people who don\\'t quite fit in and are tying desperately to find where they belong.Rank[s] as a solid sequel, one that plays to the original\\'s strengths as a sleek, brainy alternative to cartoonish James Bond bloat.To its credit, Supremacy passes on the glib vigilante scenario and aspires, fitfully, to something more ambitious and ambiguous, something involving conscience, responsibility, and humility.Exhausting but thrilling at the same time. The movie is utterly synthetic.Good enough to make one have faith in certain things again, like spy movies, sequels and the charismatically low-key, quietly lethal movie-star charisma of Matt Damon.A tour-de-force of thriller filmmaking.Almost everything that made The Bourne Identity refreshing -- the wit, the irony, the suspense, the novelty of its premise -- is gone.Greengrass gives the new film edginess and energy, though his almost constant use of jittery hand-held cameras might exhaust some viewers.One of the busiest car-chase/ car-crash movies ever.Bourne\\'s amnesia gimmick is a tired one, but there is a future in spy movies with this sort of blend of action and cynicism.Solid summer entertainment.While the movie has a higher IQ than the average summer action blitz, it underperforms as a thrill-dispenser.Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass have created a fiery, quick-witted film that presents compelling evidence that the action-suspense genre has been \"Bourne again.Eye-rattling visual chaos that many moviegoers will want to rate X, for Excedrin.The movie is mostly a series of frenetic clashes, dubious near misses and car chases. It lacks the human interest and snowy splendor of the first movie.The movie skillfully delivers a series of fights, stalkings, plottings and chases, punctuated by a little brooding.An entertaining spy thriller thankfully free of the campy, tongue-in-cheek excesses of the recent James Bond films.The screenplay by Tony Gilroy ... cuts Ludlum\\'s convolutions down to size, improves his leaden dialogue vastly and distills the action of the book to its essence.A rare breed of action flick -- one that doesn\\'t take human life for granted.This new Bourne adventure, adapted from Robert Ludlum\\'s book, is somewhat too long and burdened with one too many exhaustingly chaotic car chases, but it\\'s still almost as intelligent, exciting and fun as its predecessor.Just as thrilling, edgy and entertaining as the first installment.A terse, tight, impressively smart package.A solid cloak-and-dagger actioner.By treating the subject matter with the same kind of raw emotional intensity as his recent fact-based drama, director Greengrass literally puts us in the driver\\'s seat.Matt Damon...yeah, he\\'s still a badass.By the end I felt someone had put my brain in a blender.While Damon doesn\\'t have the benefit of surprising anyone with its sequel, \"The Bourne Supremacy,\" it proves just as enjoyable as its predecessor.The plot is a solid one. There are several twists and, although the final villains are known early in the film, it keeps you guessing as to how the end will play out. Helping the plot is a strong cast that gives great performances.The Bourne Supremacy not only lives up to the promises of the novel by Robert Ludlum, but in many ways manages to improve on the first film.As a video game that propels the viewer through the course, Supremacy is supremely successful. I\\'m not sure that\\'s enough for a movie narrative.Instead of setting aside creativity to kneel before the Movie Machine Conformitybot, Greengrass jumped out from a dark corner and knocked the \\'bot out with a bag of nickels.Not a greatly different recipe from that of the first picture, but the results aren\\'t as tasty this time around...Jason should not have been re-Bourne.The Bourne Supremacy is a summer action film... yet it impresses with its intelligence and its willingness to buck convention.The Bourne Supremacy... shares the attributes of its star, Matt Damon: Solid, down-to-earth, good-looking but not too flashy, and often capable of surprising you.Director Paul Greengrass actually has a better sense of pacing than his predecessor, Doug Liman.a sequel that actually trumps the original... establishes a tense atmosphere almost immediately... and barely lets up for the next two hours.James Bond only does things you could never do, but Bourne does things you could never even think of.Spy movies just got thrilling again.Gripping film.A refreshing alternative to the hypertrophied spy thrillers in which exaggerated action sequences, over-the-top super-villainy and high-tech gadgetry trump character and plot.A dandy paranoid thriller that begins confusingly but gets swifter and leaner as it goes.An enjoyable-enough night at the movies, though it\\'s not as well-crafted as its predecessor.With its foot pressed to the floor from beginning to end, Bourne is a non-stop gas.If you\\'ve forgotten the kick you get from watching a globe-trotting, butt-kicking, whiplash-paced action movie done with humor, style and smarts, take a ride with The Bourne Supremacy.Falls short of its predecessor in almost every area, except perhaps acting.The Bourne Supremacy is essentially a string of how- will-he-get- out-this-one set pieces, but they have been cooked up with nerve-frying elan by British director Greengrass.A classy if over-caffeinated sequel.A worthy successor to the smash original.Better than average summer fare.Brilliantly paced and cut.A spy thriller for espionage fans who feel that James Bond has gone soft in the head.An excellent follow-up that confirms Bourne as a first-class movie franchise.The Bourne Supremacy is a dynamite sequel that begs for at least one more outing with this spy who refuses to come in from the cold.More action-filled and tense than The Bourne Identity.Don\\'t let this slip by you.As thrillers go, Supremacy is indeed supreme.Moviegoers who complain about what a shaky camera does to their innards should pack antacids for this one.Supremacy is briskly paced and the screenwriting is fairly clever and crafty and salvages the film as a whole.A smart and jittery sequel.This admirable franchise should change your idea of what makes a good thriller.A sequel that reaches a higher plateau than its predecessor.A disappointment from the director of Bloody Sunday.Almost as good as its predecessor.The movie pulses forward relentlessly, and the tension never slackens.It\\'s good enough to make a third Bourne movie a welcome possibility.Somebody needs to tell filmmakers that holding a camera by hand and shaking it around is not artistic. It looks like The Bourne Witch Project.From top to bottom, from the action parts to the talky bits, The Bourne Supremacy is a movie that absolutely flies by with nary an unnecessary breath.Spy sequel has serious kick thanks to Tony Gilroy\\'s black-coffee script and Paul Greengrass\\'s two-fisted direction.A kind of rehash of the fast parts in the first movie. It\\'s not totally satisfying, but it\\'s fun while it lasts.Top-drawer genre filmmaking -- an intense, intelligent, exciting, impeccable spy thriller.... delivers the expected adrenaline-driven thrills with a fresh eye and a refreshing attitude...Despite the high speed car chases and the gleaming high-tech weaponry, \\'The Bourne Supremacy\\' is empty of any lasting impressions.A sequel that, whatever its actual motivation, doesn\\'t feel like a studio-mandated cash grab, but an organic continuation of the original, both in content and style.Basically you have The Fugitive with CIA agents moving through an entire plot that could be written on a napkin, but it moves like a thunderbolt riding a cheetah.The Bourne Supremacy\" is an exciting, finely crafted action thriller with the accent on \"thrill.The Bourne Supremacy fizzles with its reliance upon a plethora of chase sequences to compensate for its failure to create an engrossing protagonist.Matt Damon is re-bourne as a compelling action figureBourne Supremacy\\'s tag line, \"They Should Have Left Him Alone\" is so completely apropos for this particularly puzzling sequel.[F]antastic, a whiz-bang follow-up that far surpasses the original as it breathlessly zigs and zags all over the globe.The familiar character-driven story is yet another fast-paced, high-stakes, globe-trotting adventure with shaky hand-held camerawork and quick-cut editing.A welcome throwback to blood-soaked espionage thrillers, The Bourne Supremacy is a gritty sequel that hasn\\'t lost its popular appeal.Only the car chase--the best in years--is not confusing.The Bourne Supremacy ups the ante and the story zooms to a whole new level while still keeping the paranoia and the spy-vs-spy feel of the first film.If Damon played Harrison Ford\\'s Deckard character in the first film, in the second he\\'s Rutger Hauer\\'s Roy Batty.Greengrass knew not to screw up a good thing.It has an enviable level of clarity and plausibility while dynamically satisfying the conventions and requirements of the thriller.The most fun you\\'ll have in theaters this summerThe way the film has been made, nothing that happens seems inevitable -- which is to say, anything seems possible. There\\'s a word for that sensation. It\\'s called excitement.So oppressively identified with its predecessor\\'s look, sound, and design that Doug Liman warrants a co-director credit.A breathless sequel with tense intellectual punch, smart, seat-gripping action, and a hero who is utterly compelling, almost without saying a word.Have you noticed that the older he gets, the more Matt Damon resembles Ray Liotta? \\'It\\'s essential preparation for my remake of Operation Dumbo Drop,\\' notes Matt.This dark, daring sequel is Bourne\\'s journey to acknowledge the blood on his hands and atone for sins of his half-remembered past. It\\'s a tougher, more complicated movie. a cut above your average fantasy world espionage thriller.The film\\'s goals are in the right place: character development and character growth.A cold, calculating virtual redux of The Bourne Identity that leaves a bitter aftertaste in its wake. Audiences have seen this all before, many times over.Once again, Damon scores in the title role by never courting audience sympathy and playing his all-American good looks against the hard-shell brutality of the character.Every time you feel like you\\'re finally grabbing hold of something involving, the picture once again spins frustratingly out of reach.Most of Supremacy is an overedited headache that hardly makes up in frayed nerves what the visuals lack in clarity.... one of the best thrillers in recent years.nannanCheck your brain at the door.From the opening, adrenalin-pumping prison bus escape to a heart-pounding car theft aboard a fast-moving train, Fast Five throws it down from the jump.Each movie has two very good action scenes, usually at either end, but then about an hour and a half of the most asinine tough-guy nonsense between them....achieves the sort of zen chaos that defines the Die Hard filmsHard-core fans of the series with enjoy it but others should steer away from this over-the-top action flick.Has really transformed this series from camp action cinema to exciting heist cinema.Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film\\'s running time breeze by.Like a shot of nitro to the franchise and shows there\\'s plenty left in the tank.Manages to be more fun than any movie with its outrageous carbon footprint has any right to be.The series has found new traction in the heist format -- resulting in a fun and immensely entertaining ride.One film was enough, two was plenty, but five is just absurd. Undoubtedly, there will be several people who will flock to this film just because it has cars zooming back and forth, so at least some people will be pleased with it.The jauntier vibe makes for easier viewing between the big high-speed car set pieces, which are every bit as big, loud, and crazily over-the-top preposterous as one would expect and hope.It\\'s about cars, girls and fighting and doesn\\'t pretend to be anything else. For sheer gall alone, \"Fast Five\" provides much entertainment. Just not much intellect.Fast Five is grindingly mechanical -- and not just because of all the emphasis on car repairs and retooling.Forget physics, it\\'s just a fun blast of action movie ingenuity, as is the film as a whole. It\\'s not like I\\'m asking for The Road Warrior... just some basic coverage and a less-than-total reliance on camera movement to generate excitement.Director Justin Lin has a spooky, second sense for staging bombastic action sequences, even if he breaks every law in physics to make them work.It\\'s trying so hard to pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease. But that\\'s also why it\\'s entertainingnostalgic for older team films, and a world in which people interacted face to face...a frustratingly protracted piece of work that should have been so much better...Fifth time\\'s the charm.a loud, full-throttled, bombastic heist flick with no apologies for its obsessions with speed, violence, intensity,Cars zoom, guns blaze, and the quips fly with wild abandon, but the biggest achievement to be found here is the pairing of Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. About effing time. [Johnson\\'s] skin looks as though it\\'s been slathered in butter; his enjoyment is infectious and keeps the movie speeding along.Though the smash-bang chases make for dumb fun, it all mostly cruises in a noisy neutral. And with his film clocking in at over two hours, director Justin Lin might have raised his own speed limit.Cutting right to the chase, Fast Five is sure to make a furious run at the box office.While this is the best in the franchise since the first film, I still don\\'t like it because watching Vin Diesel in anything makes me want to punch myself in the face...and that\\'s just not healthy. Occasionally, though not frequently enough, something awesome happens.Even with the over-the-top acting of Dwayne Johnson and mind-numbing action sequences the film is actually watchable. Maybe being pretty darn dumb is part of its charm.This movie is so drenched with testosterone, it belongs on Major League Baseball\\'s banned substances list.All that distinguishes Fast Five from this year\\'s crop of crappy action films is a modicum of craft, cleverness and restraint.People die, cars collide, things get blown sky high. But none of it feels at all suspenseful. Lin is much better at comedy relief, which includes a sexy con by Gadot, who beats the all-hands drug czar at his own game.Sequel number four proves this franchise isn\\'t getting older - it\\'s getting better.Vin Diesel and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson square off in a movie at last. It\\'s a cosmic event, like some freak planetary collision.A screeching, testosterone-propelled fifth installment for this durable, high-octane franchise.For those of us who thought Diesel and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson were \"separated at birth,\" these two have a best-of-the-baldies throwdown that rocks our action loving world.Fast Five\" is easily one of the best in the series. Fast cars, romance, family ties and a heist comparable to that of \"Oceans Eleven\".So long as they\\'re driving it\\'s fine, but whenever they stop to open their mouths, it grinds to a halt.Another dazzling display of stunt driving and death-defying car chases involving souped-up, stolen automobiles. Don\\'t leave your brain at the door like other critics are suggesting, just hide it behind a beer helmet and gleefully guzzle Teh Stoopid away.A dumb, ridiculous movie filled with enough tough-guy stares and male posturing to last you the entire summer. But it\\'s also high on extreme stunts and crazy car crashes, carried off with minimal aid from CGI, which is actually very refreshing.It\\'s big, loud, dumb, over-the-top and mostly substanceless. But it works, perhaps better than ever before. One those exceptional sequels, even better than the original film, \\'The Fast and the Furious.\\'Stating that Fast Five is the best of the Fast and the Furious series is perhaps like claiming that the Big Mac is the best hamburger served at McDonald\\'s: It\\'s not so much a declaration of excellence as an example of damning with faint praise.One of the better entries in the series. That\\'s not to say it isn\\'t big and dumb, only that its big dumbness is executed with some degree of competence....opens with a bang and picks up speed from there...spectacular cinematography...loaded to the gills with high octane music. Wow, the only way this film could be more ludicrous is if they actually cast Ludacris in it. Oh wait...All together now ... if you loved the first four Furious films there\\'s no reason on Earth why you won\\'t dig Fast FiveThat force of chaotic and unsatisfiable desire that Freud called the id is much closer to the surface in a movie like \"Fast Five\" than ever before in action-cinema history, and part of Lin\\'s peculiar genius is that he barely tries to conceal it.The film\\'s plot rarely makes sense and the script is lackluster, but who cares when each chase is composed of the right amount of speed and clarity? Lin never puts his foot on the break until the last possible second.The action in this movie is the key to what makes it fun. Who cares about the plot, character, story or even physics at this point. If it looks cool on screen, it works.The calendar may say that Summer is a few months away, but the escapist entertainment that the season is known for starts today with the release of this rocking thrill ride, one of the most purely enjoyable movies in a long time.The chemistry of the core cast - steered by Vin Diesel and Paul Walker - keeps this outing from running on fumes.The whole thing progresses to one of the looniest heists of all time. The result is the most exciting, visually jazzy, and absurd entry in the series.As always, the action combines buff bods, sculpted sheet metal, testosterone, guns, bone-crushing throwdowns, tattoos, revving engines and a \"Transformers\"-like delight in having as many things as possible smash into each otherSure, the plot, dialogue and acting are as silly as usual. But buoyed by a sparkling Rio setting and an awesomely staged third-act action setpiece, Fast Five is the series\\' best outing since the original. This is what a summer movie should be - knowingly silly, fun, light, thrilling, packed with real stunts and not-so-subtle gayness.Originality isn\\'t Fast Five\\'s goal so much as distillation; Lin\\'s aim is to make the ultimate version of a Fast and the Furious film and the third time appears to be the charm for him as director. Fast Five is the best of the series.It\\'s still a \\'check your brains at the door\\' action entry, but as a thrill ride it, sets the high bar for the summer\\'s releases.Fast Five\\'s final chase sequence involving a stolen vault is, hands down, the best action sequence of the entire franchise.Watching Fast Five is like being savagely beaten for two hours and ten minutes by the staff at Advance Auto Parts.There\\'s check-your-brains-at-the-door and then there\\'s brain-dead. Fast Five, the improbable fourth sequel to The Fast and the Furious, falls somewhere between the two. Making sure the audience knows that the writers \\'\\'get it\\'\\' with a little humor and some crazy action makes the silliness easy to forgive and fun to watch.Finally, The Rock has come back to the action genre.You can\\'t say Fast Five delivers the goods, but it delivers what it\\'s supposed to.With a bit better plot and character familiarity, Fast Five is more fun than the original and now ranks - at least in this critic\\'s opinion - as the best of the bunch.Always preposterous though never actually silly, knowingly funny without ever being self-conscious, Fast Five is a passable action flick that will more than entertain its core audience.Fifth entry in the series could be the best, with a muy macho cast and delirious action sequences delivering exactly what fans want.Bold and beautiful in its hard-charging simplicity.A paean to reckless driving and fuel inefficency, this fifth film in the franchise is the most spectacular and elaborate yet, bringing new meaning to the term \\'muscle car\\' by pitting series regular Vin Diesel against Dwayne \\'The Rock\\' Johnson.The supreme idiocy on display really wouldn\\'t matter if the film just bothered to acknowledge it.A balls to the wall action film, and never for a second does it deviate.Doesn\\'t make much sense, but its action worksFast Five\" is the perfect definition of a guilty-pleasure movie. In this film, what stunt drivers and stunt people do with their machines and bodies defy the laws of physics, nature and reason.Embarrassingly fun, the sort of speedy, senseless, violence-crammed action flick that virtually defines the summer season, with superheroes who aren\\'t gods or crusaders in tights but guys in T-shirts and jeans who can drive cars really fast.Even with wooden acting and dreadful dialogue, the action-packed charms of Fast Five cannot be denied.I can forgive a lot if you make me leave the theater thinking \"THAT... WAS... AWESOME.With its sweat glistening off tanned muscles mannerism and hard-nosed bare knuckle bravado, Fast Five is the perfect cure for a Spring season filled with failed attempts at recapturing past glories.If there were any more testosterone here, Jose Canseco could have boiled down the screen and injected it.If Hollywood can make the rest of the summer as brainlessly fun as this then maybe people will start going back to the multiplex.If you\\'re in the mood for the cinematic equivalent of sugar and trans fats, the film delivers with one physics-defying set piece after another.All I can say is that I am now dreading Part Six and looking to Part Seven with something resembling vague optimism, especially if all involved can use the time to steal a better and tighter plot along the way.The more outrageous it becomes the more impossible the film is to criticize.There\\'s good stuff, but it\\'s the weakest of the \"Fast\" films.Something like Ocean\\'s Eleven and its various numerations, except with muscle cars and knuckleheads and without the laughs.If you\\'re in the mood for the cinematic equivalent of sugar and trans fats, the film delivers with one physics-defying set piece after another.Treats interpersonal bonds as a concept that it knows about but can\\'t quite come to grips with, considering all the horsepower and crashes upon which it would rather focus.A slam-bang start to the summer. Sure, it\\'s supposed to just be a silly popcorn movie, but treating these cardboard cutouts as people to admire and care about is dishonest and contemptible. That the movie sucks besides is the final insult.The film gets much better in its second half when it becomes an \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" type adventure featuring many faces that will instantly be familiar to \"Fast/Furious\" fans. Gets lots of mileage from a combination of high spirits, scorn for the laws of physics, readily renewable energy and an emphasis on family values -- not those of the nuclear family, but of hell-raising, drag-racing outlaws...Ignoring the rules of physics doesn\\'t make a movie more entertaining; it merely makes the writing easier. If a screenplay can cheat at any time, it encourages sloppy authorship.It\\'s when the action slows down that you can feel the brain cells dying.The series takes the curious, surprising and rather brave route of ditching the street-racing shenanigans that defined the series in favor of a more standard action-oriented plot. It\\'s an interesting approach, but the series\\' shallowness remainsA movie with exploding toilets, cars that move sideways and a big chase sequence with Walker and Brewster fleeing favela goons by crashing through the tin roofs of shanty-town shacks.Who knew the fourth sequel to The Fast and the Furious would not only refuel a flagging franchise, but lead the pack as the best of the bunch?Who knew that the best place to put Vin Diesel would be between the Rock and a hard place? The spot has never been tighter, or righter, and the testosterone never higher than in the hot jacking action of \"Fast Five.As a moviegoer, there are times when you want, say, \"Jane Eyre,\" and then there are times when a movie about really large men who drive cars really fast is just the thing. \"Fast Five\" is that latter movie, and then some.All the characters from the prior four Fast and Furious films are rounded up to do their own grease monkey version of \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" by Chris Morgan\\'s enjoyably ludicrous script, which, by right\\'s, should have been called \"Toretto\\'s Ten.\" The ensemble cast creates a really fun atmosphere by embracing the blatant ridiculousness of the films. And isn\\'t that what enjoying a big, dumb action movie is all about?Like a proper action sequel, it\\'s bigger, louder, and sillier than its predecessors, but it\\'s more streamlined, too, smartly dumping the tired underground racing angle in favor of a crisp, hugely satisfying Ocean\\'s Eleven-style heist movie. Beyond implausible, but it works as a live-action cartoon.Fast Five\\'\\' is, so far, the most honest Hollywood movie of the year. It\\'s also the most fun.\\'Fast Five\\' will push all your action buttons, and some you haven\\'t thought of. So what if you hate yourself in the morning.It took ten years, but here, finally, is a worthwhile sequel to The Fast and the FuriousHere\\'s a popcorn flick strong enough for a man and gentle enough for a woman.A giant overdose of testosterone mixed with soap opera for muscleheads and gearheads.Between this and last year\\'s overlooked \"Faster,\" it\\'s great to see The Rock re-embracing the action genre, and when his clobbering match with Diesel finally happens, it\\'s as outlandishly room-wrecking as I\\'d hoped.Defying laws of physics, laws of acting, and the law of diminishing returns, Fast Five delivers a ridiculously fun mix of motorized macho mayhem and multicultural bonding.We will race cars, we will crash cars, and at some point, a large-breasted woman in a low-cut blouse will lean over an engine block.In a free-for-all like this, where the laws of gravity and dictates of narrative logic are left to eat dust, it doesn\\'t matter when anything takes place or why.Fast Five\" represents Yankee ingenuity of the brutally stupid kind.Fast Five is among the best fourth sequels ever - not exactly high praise but more than I expected to dish out.Patently absurd and yet wildly entertaining; a marked improvement over its excessively dour predecessor.It isn\\'t quite summer-movie season yet, but Fast Five is already peeling down to its proverbial, sweat-sodden muscle shirt in preparation. It\\'s ready for anything.The biggest, best and most furious Fast of them all.[The] fifth lap of the brainlessly macho series should please fans...while making everybody else wonder why.These movies are sheer silliness, improbable roadway mayhem interspersed with obligatory fistfights and gunplay, all coated with a noxious layer of adolescent macho posturing.Well, it\\'s a more fun trip to Rio than Rio. As the reckless flailing of a lot of meatheads, Fast Five is essentially a food fight with sloppy Joes.While dopey as ever, the fun factor has increased exponentially now that certain plot elements and subculture porn has been ditched to roughhouse in Rio with a band of crooks who\\'ve blossomed into a family.Now this is how you make a summer movie.I wish I could say that Fast Five was the fastest, most furious movie of the series, and that there wouldn\\'t be a faster, more furious movie all year. I have to be honest though. Fast Five just wasn\\'t fast enough for me, and it\\'s hardly furious at all.Heads into the garage for almost the entirety of its sluggish middle section, which turns into a second-rate Ocean\\'s Eleven-style heist movie.This episode has the highest velocity and lowest IQ yet. See it on the biggest, loudest, dumbest screen you can find.The film is basically Ocean\\'s Fourteen starring a multiculti version of the cast of Jersey Shore.Pretty cars, prettier women, insanely absurd action that truly thrills even as it shatters all physical laws, and enough testosterone-fueled violence to satisfy the most-rabid WWE SmackDown crowd.If you liked any of the previous movies, you should be even more thrilled by what they\\'ve done this time around with a lot more at play here in terms of storytelling.For seeing gigantic men beat the hell out of one another and for leering at sexed-up hotties zipping around on scooters you\\'ll be hard pressed to find any film that\\'s its equal - until Fast Six.Inspired action choreography, macho mentality, aggressive stunt work and nimble editing rule. Despite a few sluggish moments, it had me and it left me all revved up.As confident and charismatic as its lead characters and every bit as fun to be around....a film that\\'s custom-built to combine the swift horsepower of characters we like with the stylish chrome of fresh changes is a welcome pleasure. Far less interested in vehicular craziness than the wisecracking repartee of its supporting specialists.Such was my \\'exfivement\\', I couldn\\'t remember the last time I was on the edge of my seat during an action sequence like this.Fast-paced and visually breathtaking.Showing improvement as action director, Justin Lin has made an unpretentious thrill ride of a movie, one of the few Hollywood pics whose characters reflect America\\'s multi-racial composition.When it\\'s exciting, it is really exciting.As usual, the film thrives on excess.Summer roars to a start with Fast Five which features some of the most spectacular action sequences seen on the screen in years.It\\'s not the sign of a particularly good film when the entire cast could be replaced by belligerent three-year-olds and you could expect most of the line readings to remain exactly the same.Fast Five maintains the winning formula and underlines the sad fact that stars Vin Diesel and Paul Walker still have nothing better to do.Where there\\'s demand, there\\'s supply, and this franchise will shoot up the box office chart because it\\'s undemanding and fiercely electrifying entertainment.At the very least, petrol-headed punters won\\'t be left fuming by what whizzes past in a blur here.With belief soundly suspended and your senses of sight and sound reeling under full frontal assault, this hybrid of action, chase movie sets the bar low - and clears it with ease.Starts well with dippily exciting action and daft dialogue, but outstays its welcome as it devolves into a deeply daft Ocean\\'s Eleven riff.The Fast and Furious roadshow isn\\'t slowing down a bit in Fast Five, by most measures the best of the bunch, combining fresh casting choices, interesting Rio locales and literally smashing bookended action sequences.The on-going storyline is now running on fumes, but when director Justin Lin cuts to the chase there\\'s enough left in the tank for some spectacular vehicular mayhem.There\\'s something deeply unpleasant about this latest flick that prevented me from enjoying all the stuff blowing up real good... Imagine Robin Hood nuking Nottingham Castle after tweaking the Sheriff...Somehow, Lim manages to keep you pinned to the passenger seat for over two gas-guzzling hours - with no perceptible drop in testosterone levels.It\\'s possibly the most brainless film of the year. Until the third Transformers film surfaces, that is.Fantastic fun.This palpable nonsense, which has a plot that defies all but Hollywood\\'s logic, is so smartly produced and directed that even its inordinate length doesn\\'t matter all that much.The stony performances don\\'t really matter, and neither does the blunt dialog. But it\\'s still great fun.Make no mistake, this is no masterpiece of the dramatic arts but it is probably the best since the original: lean, spectacular, funny and slightly less risible than its predecessors.Attempts to add emotional depth are misguided, but this is an entertaining popcorn flick.A huge letdown.Overlong but slick, this still gets away with simplistic dialogue and characters, perhaps because it doesn\\'t take itself too seriously.Five films in and the Fast and the Furious franchise finally gets itself into gear with the wonderfully over the top Fast Five.Utterly preposterous, but this car-crazy franchise is armor-plated.You\\'d think the Fast And The Furious franchise would\\'ve run out of gas by now. Think again.Seriously fast driving, jaw-dropping action, some unexpected twists and an audacious central heist with an extraordinary climactic sequenceSlow and spurious.nannannanIt\\'s a smart film and pure Coen. It has a point, though some may contest it. But it\\'s not a must-see film for everyone so if you are a Coen fan, don\\'t take your grandmother. She will say it sucks. The Coen Brothers are back with a triumphant return to form.No Country for Old Men is a great return to form for the Coens. Even if you\\'ve never been a big fan of theirs, it\\'s a film you should see if you like a good thriller.The film clearly and finally represents the mainstream success that has long eluded the Coens. Longtime fans, fear not: This is no sell-out. There is still plenty of what the Coens do best.The Coens have returned... full of talent. [Full review in Spanish]No Country for Old Men is imbued with a dry, minimalist, almost crude style and forms a dark and violent universe that reveals the horror and moral rot rooted in American society. [Full Review in Spanish] The lack of respect for the body, the sheer bloody aftermath depresses me. Yes, they may handle the killing with verve and ironic tension, but this is a Coen brothers film too far.... a perfect match of story and storyteller.There\\'s no denying the movie and this character\\'s power to shake you. The implacable Chigurh dominates the proceedings like no other Coen villain before him.One of the most thoughtful and startling snapshots of the human condition of the last ten years.Played by Spanish actor Javier Bardem, Chigurh is the most original bogeyman to bloody up the screen in a while.The last word on the modern-day western used to be Peckinpah\\'s. No Country for Old Men is Peckinpah gone post-Peckinpah.From brutal start to ironic finish the movie\\'s tension is constant.I can\\'t help feeling the film is ultimately hollow.An exasperating and self-defeating experience, rather like listening to a nymphomaniac extol the virtues of celibacy.As much as the film is about Bardem\\'s even-keeled determination... it\\'s also about Tommy Lee Jones\\' brilliantly characterized Texas sheriff, who, faced with a trail of blood like he\\'s never seen, wonders if he\\'s still a match for a changing world. No Country for Old Men is an action film both measured and grave, opening as a Jim Thompson-esque crime saga set on the Texan sands, but as it moves along the film acquires an allegorical depth.This magnificent film represents the best work the Coen Brothers have done since Fargo. Like that classic this is a cold-blooded thriller with a darkly humorous edge. No Country for Old Men is a thoroughly compelling exercise in the cinema of suspense that proves the power of the old-school thriller remains undiminished.It\\'s not a film that asks to be either liked or disliked. It just is, branding itself on to you like a heated iron.Don\\'t be put off with all of the mentions of violence. Yes, bloodletting is at the core of the movie, and the ending is as downbeat as the opening scenes. But, gosh, you know you have been to see a great film.It\\'s an instant classic, as thrilling as it is quiet and hypnotic, and all the more powerful for anchoring a story with essentially three characters, none of whom share the frame together, being, how they are, one small step behind the other.Seventy minutes into the film, there\\'s a rude burst of mariachi music as the hero awakes... That wouldn\\'t be worth noting, except that we suddenly realize that for the first tense, suspense-filled hour of the film there has been no music at all.There are constant twists and turns, eventually straining credulity, but there\\'s also -- and typically for The Coens -- a salutary quorum of absurdist dialogue, black humour and wryly memorable exchanges.The suspense is killer. Hitchcock would be sick with jealousy.No Country for Old Men is wide and dusty and terribly bleak. It\\'s beautifully photographed and assembled, with great performances from its lead players and a number of welcome appearances by actors we haven\\'t seen enough of lately.Javier Bardem makes for a terrifying villain. He looks physically corrupt but seems every bit as relentless as the Terminator. He\\'s also believably, psychotically human.The Coens imbue this simple tale with their trademark quirkiness and wry humour.I have never been so frustrated with a movie as I was with No Country for Old Men. I hope I never am again.Death always gets the last laugh -- and what makes the Coens so remarkable is how they dare to cackle at the punch lines.Morose vagueness will get No Country for Old Men called a classic, instead of what it is: an often effective but pompous grindhouser. Its pretensions are so big, you couldn\\'t fit them in Texas.I love this film.Only the Coen brothers could make a film so impressively brutal and yet so understated as this. It helps that the set-up is so fiendishly simple. Blood simple, you might say.So, yes, you should probably see No Country for Old Men, even if it does bow out with a baffling little coda featuring an old timer\\'s meditation on the fact that he\\'s estranged from his father.Haunting, hard- bitten and absurdly involving.Spanish actor Javier Bardem should leave audiences gasping with his stone-cold performance in the blood-spattered saga No Country For Old Men.The movie rarely loses its grip and is a remarkable accomplishment.The Coen brothers\\' No Country for Old Men is a rare example of a too-faithful adaptation of a novel, one that stubbornly refuses to explore and expound upon what the text readily provides.The cinematic American West is vast enough for us to fill with our imaginations, taking a simple shadow play and transforming it into an eternal campfire tale.No Country for Old Men is a great Texas film. It is great unequivocally, but Lone Star pride is a rare opportunity in Hollywood.Cormac McCarthy\\'s amazing novel was blessed with a usually impossible faithful adaption that translated the power of the words and weaved them into cinema.Films this good come along once, maybe twice in a lifetime.There\\'s nothing extraordinary about No Country for Old Men -- except, of course, the spectacle of two great directors in total command of their craft.A mostly absorbing tale of the hunter being subverted into the hunted, No Country For Old Men deserves to be lauded for its gripping, relentless thrills rather than its flawed denouement.This film truly belongs to Javier Bardem.No Country is a pitch-perfect thriller that delivers the pleasurable fear and suspense expected of the genre even as it sends its conventions to the shredder.McCarthy\\'s bloody and beautiful novel comes to life under the Coen\\'s able touch.The decade\\'s most overrated movieOnce you open Pandora\\'s Box, there\\'s simply no stopping the beasts that pour out.What starts off as the best Charles Bronson movie not to star Charles Bronson ends up as a literary adaptation of a novel that thinks it means something or other.No Country for Old Men is the brothers at their most polished, austere, and humorless.When you see No Country for Old Men, leave your preconceptions at home. But bring your Alfred Hitchcock lenses. They\\'re useful. No Country for Old Men is a dazzling time-bomb of a movie. It is an engrossing, brutal, nerve-wracking moral taleThe plot is adapted from Cormac McCarthy\\'s novel but seems ready-made for the Coens, putting them back on familiar stomping grounds, the hellish Texas they showed us in their debut film, Blood Simple.For a film that traffics in implacable malice, this movie remains remarkably grounded in the everyday.Ultimately, No Country For Old Men is a very strong film that\\'s just a couple of bad decisions away from being a masterpiece.This is some of Brolin\\'s best work to date, though the film still belongs to Bardem and Jones, whose low-key mannerisms are well-suited to the Coens\\' sensibilities.McCarthy\\'s ferocious tale gives the Coens room to unleash their cinematic gifts, but keeps them from wandering too far afield and losing themselves in the marshes of technical prowess or easy irony.Although \\'No Country for Old Men\\' is an exciting film, wise screen violence needs more emotional depth below surface technique.Not since Fargo have the Coen Brothers made such a perfect movie.Why, Joel and Ethan, why did you have to ruin an almost flawless film with a terrible last scene?I was a little worried when I went to see \"No Country for Old Men\" because many people have been labeling it a masterpiece, but for once all the hype is warranted.No Country for Old Men is the kind of film that will only cement the opinion you already have about its uniquely eccentric makers. Approach the ticket booth accordingly.Retains the Coen brothers\\' trademark quirkiness, and it certainly goes all out. But it\\'s also subtle in ways we haven\\'t seen before.The most fascinating element of the film is its formal linking of its multiple, no-nonsense protagonists. [Blu-Ray review]Thank goodness that experiment in appeasing the commercial suit types is over and the quirky brothers are back to form with No Country for Old Men, a dark and violent exploration of nature\\'s hunt and the relevance of time.The problem comes when we realize it\\'s a Tommy Lee Jones film and the title is more than just a random coincidence. It\\'s a really good film that was almost great....the Coens sabotage their wonderfully understated style in No Country with the trivial substance of their narrative.This is the Coens\\' masterful return to Blood Simple territory. The biggest thing you\\'ll notice is the quiet: Whether it\\'s the lack of a soundtrack or a lack of dialogue, the silence often makes the tension unbearable.What is perhaps most amazing is that a film this terrifying, violent and relentlessly nihilistic should also be this enthralling.Javier Bardem\\'s Chigurh is the embodiment of Sheriff Bell\\'s exasperation -- a mythological, Grim Reaper-like figure whose existence makes order and civility implausible.Chockful of suspense.The Coens stir up more panic by quietly flicking off a light switch than Michael Bay did with a fleet of Decepticons.It\\'s Jones who carries the film\\'s meaning, and does so effortlessly. He -- and the Coens -- have never been better.Good fortune found is always promising before bad fortune comes looking for it.I\\'m a big fan of the Coens. But, I\\'ve got to say, I\\'m not much appreciating this picture.Sure to wow the critics, but no movie for the masses.Virtuoso. A film of pin-sharp principles, cross-hair precision and suffocating tension, this Coens stunner hits like a cattle gun between the eyes.Is it a masterpiece? Not even close.Watching this film has something of the elemental thrill of watching a cloud-shadow spread with miraculous speed over a vast, empty landscape: it has a chilly, portentous intuition of what America is.With its sly wit, dark intelligence and tense action sequences this film re-establishes the Coens as two of American cinema\\'s most talented directors. It\\'s also the best adaptation of McCarthy\\'s work to date and an unmissable crime movie.The Coen brothers have once again placed themselves at the very forefront of American cinema.A masterly tale of the good, the deranged and the doomed that inflects the raw violence of the west with a wry acknowledgement of the demise of codes of honour, this is frighteningly intelligent and imaginative.Violent, poetic, gripping, thrilling and blackly funny: that\\'ll be the Coens doing what they do best then. Now with added humanity.Terrifically acted, superbly written and masterfully directed by the Coen Brothers, this is an incredibly suspenseful thriller that looks set for Oscar glory come February.It is a bloody and grisly film at times, but this is one of those few times where the violence and gore are not just necessary but essential. On first viewing its simply thrilling, on subsequent viewing I get the feeling this will only grow in estimation.Creepy time down south.The Coens have given us a film so unlike anything they\\'ve made before, and in doing so, they\\'ve given us a work of complete, devastating brilliance.While watching it, I kept thinking I have finally seen it - the clear best film of the year, then the film gets to a critical point and literally stops.Wildly overpraised, but a solid return to form for the Coen Bros.No Country is not a film for weak, unsteady hearts.I think this just might be [the Coens\\'] best film so far, with some qualifications.An utterly enormous piece of filmmaking...This anti-Western set in the dusty southwest is pretty good for the first two acts, but burns out well before the end.No Country for Old Men is the most brutal cinematic experience of the year, as well as one the best. It\\'s nothing shy of an unforgettable masterpiece.It\\'s the unexpected nature of the characters and what happens to them that makes this return to form from the Coen Brothers both intriguing and satisfying.a film whose long, twisted narrative roads, rather than converging on some obvious, hackneyed point of closure, instead open out to infinite horizons.Examines a soulless America that can\\'t live with or without violence.How much does chance play in our clashes with evil? If that\\'s too philosophical for you, then, pardner, you\\'d best turn to entertainment other than \"No Country for Old Men,\" arguably the best yet from the Coen brothers. Adult, sophisticated, and often ambBalloons don\\'t blow into funny shapes, and its narrative direction isn\\'t fairly self-explanatory. Yet to watch it is to gaze at the chilling, pitch-black flipside of \"Raising Arizona,\" and be haunted by penetrating, unflinching stares it gives back.The duo may have created their most accomplished and compelling movie to date.No Country for Old Men is a modern American masterpiece, a film of unbridled power and purpose.Another fascinating and unpredictable character-driven movie from the Coen brothers.I treasure movies such as this - movies that put you in a location, allow you to soak up the details, and constantly take you places you don\\'t anticipate going. No Country For Old Men is a masterpiece.Joel and Ethan Coen have a great catalog of films behind them, but they paint their masterpiece with No Country For Old Men.Imagine, if you will, that you are on an amazing vacation. One for the ages. Then, on the last day - you are mugged. No matter what transpired before, the trip is tainted.An extremely tense exercise.It\\'s the kind of movie that cries out for a second look, because it\\'s easy to admire, hard to actually like and harder still to penetrateA brutal and violent film that breaks some of the rules that we expect from crime thrillers. NO COUNTRY is gripping, but it goes for the gut instead of the head.Javier Bardem steals the show as perhaps the most unnerving screen villain of the year, a monster who ups the ante in terms of tension by holding a cattle gun to his victims\\' heads while flipping a coin to determine who lives and who dies.This is the blackest film noir in years, and a great American movie.a nail-biting masterpiece of suspense, operating on a philosophical level that is as sophisticated as it is compellingAlmost the best movie of the year.Javier Bardem\\'s sadistic fiend has got to be the most ghoulish homicidal maniac around since Jack The Ripper.It proves [the Coens] can hold an audience in thrall with the simplest of cinema\\'s elements: a memorable image....a thoughtful, mature and earnestly meant work about the essential problem of being human-- the suspicion that this is all there is, and that all our noble ideas about honor and decency, about right and wrong, matter not at all to darkening sky andThe film is a slow burn, not building, not petering out, just becoming gradually more nerve-wracking as each plot point makes itself known. Astounding sound design by Craig Berkey.No Country for Old Men isn\\'t the first great movie certain to have its ending criticized even by many who enjoyed the rest of the picture.And boy howdy, does that dialogue howl like a basset hound pup who\\'s just been yanked from his momma.With \"No Country for Old Men,\" the brothers Coen return to Texas -- and to form.The Coens load the film with realistic touches that add grit and meaning to the almost mythical plot.Joel and Ethan Coen, working from a novel by Cormac McCarthy, have made one of the darkest and best movies of the year.With No Country for Old Men the Coens may have made their ultimate statement. You may not agree with their pessimism, but they so effectively tell their story that you cannot help but be swept up in their vision.Not satisfied with just being one of the best thrillers I\\'ve ever seen, \"No Country of Old Men\" goes beyond that in its third act to becoming a haunting and unforgettable American classic.Bardem, as the man with the odd, long, bowl-cut/pageboy hair and a powerful air compressor that a lesser murderer might give a cute nickname to, is the single most chilling human being to inhabit a movie about death in Texas since Leatherface.This stark and grimly violent tale of humankind\\'s insignificance in the presence of a force it is helpless to control or predict is a morality tale of existential proportions -- and with contemporary implications.With its dizzying alternations of comedy and horror, the film is unmistakably a Coen brothers movie -- albeit a much better one than they\\'ve made in a while.Holds up against the Coens\\' earlier genre masterpieces like Miller\\'s Crossing and Fargo.I would have preferred a bit more resolution, but it\\'s hard to fault the filmmakers for sticking to their filmic styleNo Country for Old Men isn\\'t quite a masterpiece. It\\'s simply an exercise in fine craftsmanship, whose craftsmen suit each other superbly.Don\\'t believe the hype. The most unsatisfying conclusion to a film since the final episode of \"The Sopranos\". And that which led up to it wasn\\'t so great either.People are calling it the best film of the year, and if it isn\\'t, it\\'s darn close.Let me just say up front what a pleasure it is to watch a well-crafted film in which not a word or a gesture is wasted.A world of bad men that\\'s easy to get trapped in and impossible to escape fromNo Country for Old Men looks into the unfathomable depths of evil and poses existential questions about human destiny. Meanwhile, it takes your breath away.This is as good a chase thriller as you could want.A rare instance of great American filmmakers taking on a great American book, and winning.Joel and Ethan Coen have directed their best film since Fargo more than a decade ago.This isn\\'t just another notch on the Coen brothers\\' amazing career of exquisitely crafted crime dramas. It\\'s an instant American classic, and the first truly must-see awards contender of the year.There are still a lot of good movies slated for November and December, but it\\'s hard to imagine anything topping the Coen brothers\\' chiller-thriller No Country for Old Men.Murder for its own sake wears quickly on me and I found myself wanting to flee the theater, and the sooner the better.What makes the movie a masterpiece, however, is not the Coens\\' supreme command of their craft in these scenes, but their willingness to embrace the resigned worldview of McCarthy\\'s novel.[It] just might be the Coen brothers\\' singular mythic masterwork.A cold, rough look at the dissolution of just about everything. It will bother you afterward. It should.Bardem is nothing less than the best movie villain since Anthony Hopkins slipped out of Hannibal Lecter\\'s manacles, scary-smart and horrifyingly appealing, and Brolin is nothing short of a revelation.This movie is that stunning.The desert is as cold and bleak as McCarthy\\'s view of humanity, so the laughs may not dare even leave your throat.The storytelling is fluid, especially when directors Joel and Ethan Coen start eliding some of the murders and ask us to imagine them for ourselves.The mood is darker and quieter than the Coens usually present, though some of the dialogue has a deadpan humor.Working from a Cormac McCarthy novel that has the heedless, headlong force of an action movie screenplay, Joel and Ethan Coen have improved upon the original by giving it a visual lyricism to match McCarthy\\'s verbal barrage.Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen build and sustain tension so masterfully throughout this adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\\'s novel that even trouble that\\'s been telegraphed still shocks when it arrives.A muscular, exact and thrillingly cool movie.The Coen brothers\\' best movie, hands down, is a chase film in which all the characters scatter their essences as they run.Shockingly effective and incomprehensibly great, No Country for Old Men proves that the Coen Brothers are America\\'s reigning motion picture Gods.It\\'s as close to a perfect film as I\\'ve seen all year: ingeniously crafted, thematically consistent, and haunting in its implications.This is intense, provocative filmmaking on every level that is sure to be one of the best American films of the year.... strong, evocative storytelling pared to the bone and braced with a sensibility perfectly matched to the material.[N]o Coen human low-pressure system yet has been anything like the nightmare of centered psychosis that is Javier Bardem\\'s Anton Chigurh.The story is vintage McCarthy in its sense of place and its poetic voice. And it is vintage Coens for some of those same traits, and its cruel, graphic violence.This Coen Brothers adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel may be their darkest film yet. It\\'s also one of their best.It\\'s been six years and two movies since the Coen brothers directed a feature that didn\\'t embarrass the memory of everything else they\\'ve ever made, but, with No Country for Old Men, the writing-directing duo are back to old form.Call it terrifying, stunningly bleak, humane, epic, intimate, darkly funny, deadly serious, or what have you: Whatever laudatory adjectives you throw its way are going to stick.The film leaves you to figure whether such perception is real, Anton is random, or Carla Jean sees something about the \"country\" the men cannot.The Coens return to form, creating their most idiosyncratic characters since Steve Buscemi\\'s Carl Showalter faced down the wood chipper in Fargo.Let\\'s just say it\\'s all amazing. No Country for Old Men is exactly the kind of challenge film buffs will love if you\\'re sick of the by the numbers, multiplex drivel.The hype was right. No Country for Old Men is basically flawless.The Coens are wintry and dead calm ironists, and their movie is finally less an assault on our sensibilities than a subtle -- and possibly permanent -- insinuation into our consciousnesses.If nothing else, No Country should win an award for Best Use of an Oxygen Tank.If you\\'re not looking for a \"Fargo\"-level masterpiece but just for a badass modern Western, it delivers plenty on that level.Tommy Lee Jones combines forces with the Coen Brothers in the unforgiving winds of the West Texas prairie. Javier Barden\\'s psycho-killer and the Coens\\' creepy direction and screenwriting pops out the grittiest film of the year.The Coens return to their darker, earlier days and Brolin and Bardem deliver terrific performances.After two artistic flops, it appeared that filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen had taken a fall. Not so. They\\'re back with their twelfth and perhaps greatest film.The Coen Brothers make the same old story exciting again by telling the entire story in action. Nobody explains their plans, they just see what they have to do and do it. It\\'s all clear, and it\\'s never slow.A great American film. A dark and sometimes bleakly comic vision of our violent culture.No Country for Old Men may just be the year\\'s best picture.This Country is for anyone who loves movies.The Coen brothers\\' screenplay is faithful to McCarthy without being obsequious. In filming it, they play it straight, and the touches of signature humor that are there don\\'t seem like flashes of style, but organic and right.No Country for Old Men is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy, but it shows all the Coen strengths. One is a genuine interest in the way people work.Deeper, funnier and even stranger than Fargo.No Country for Old Men is the first movie I\\'ve seen in a very long while that deserves to be called a masterpiece. It\\'s such a stunning achievement in storytelling.The film is as lean and mean as a barbed-wire necktie, darkly funny and much deeper than the average crime thriller.It\\'s grim, unforgiving and probably unforgettable -- in some ways you\\'ll want to remember, and in others you may wish you couldn\\'t.Both perplexing and engrossing as it explores humanity\\'s animal instincts. This being McCarthy and the Coens, nothing is spelled out. The seeds are there and they will flourish in a fertile mind.There isn\\'t a performance in this film that isn\\'t exquisitely in key or a frame in this film that doesn\\'t feel right. At times, the movie deliberately leaves us grasping to understand what we\\'ve seen.The Coens are geniuses at creating tension through editing. No Country has craft and atmosphere aplenty.As pure craftsmanship, No Country for Old Men is as good as we\\'ve ever gotten from Joel and Ethan Coen.With stunning landscapes around the Tex-Mex border shot by Roger Deakins and the elements of pursuit and retribution, the saga draws from the Western tradition in which the characters become dwarfed by nature.The Coens understand the stark immediacy of this tale, and they visualize it with brilliantly judged details.An intense, nihilistic thriller as well as a model of implacable storytelling, this is a film you can\\'t stop watching even though you very much wish you could.The Coen brothers...shape the parched, timeless Tex-Mex borderland into a character itself, a place where good and evil alike swelter under the sun, and the prairie wind whistles by uncaring.Most audiences will look at the film and see only the simple plot of a fugitive and his two pursuers, but is there more being said and more being asked within the wide open spaces of No Country for Old Men? Indisputably.It\\'s almost too good to be true that the Coen Brothers have adapted McCarthy\\'s novel and brought it to the screen, though it is their bleakest work to date.Indeed, within the framework of this film it truly is no country for old men, and as that harsh realization presents itself the only emotion left is a form of quietly overpowering devastation.The tension of being around a psycho-killer like Anton keeps you on the edge of your seat, with the much-needed relief coming in the brand of humor that only the Coen brothers can deliver.In almost seven years as a critic, I have never said this within a review, and here it is: This film is a masterpiece.No Country for Old Men is as good a film as the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, have ever made, and they made Fargo.An eerily quiet, bracingly bloody, and expertly laid-out adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel.The simple saga of two tough hombres, a bag of money and everybody unlucky enough to get in their way blossoms into something far more delicate, contemplative and almost mythical.Brutal and intense, it\\'s an enigmatic, metaphysical mindgame.It\\'s a localized scenario, but what the movie skillfully does is increase its philosophical scale ever so slowly.The Coens have left all their tricks and ironic jokery behind and the resulting film feels deeper and more personally felt than anything they have done before.The Coens have found the perfect source material to continue their dominance of the crime genre while making a second viewing an absolute must to appreciate all the voices involved.the neo-western byproduct of a deranged and adrift zeitgeistThis is the best film the Coen brothers have done since their glory days of Fargo and The Big Lebowski, maybe the best they\\'ve done, period.Cormac McCarthy\\'s book about a man who finds a case full of money at the scene of a drug deal gone very, very wrong is ideally suited for the Coen brother\\'s understated talk and striking visuals....an elegy for an American way of life that may make liberals side with the old El Paso Sheriff who bemoans today\\'s youth with their drugs and green hair. It\\'s a Texan lament not heard since The Last Picture Show.The Coen brothers, once again, prove they are an American asset to film.For formalists -- those moviegoers sent into raptures by tight editing, nimble camera work and faultless sound design -- No Country for Old Men is pure heaven.It thunders with the mordant wit, blood-soaked pessimism, and human folly that mark their unique auteurial stamp.The result, while it may be their most ambitious and successful film in years, remains just a Coen brothers movie, a curio to collect rather than an experience to remember.Bardem\\'s unnerving performance is the one that will stay with you.A whip-smart, fingernail-chewing creation that crackles with tension and is pocked with thrilling incarnations of evil. It makes the standard-issue nightmare seem like a tropical vacation.This acerbic, darkly poetic Coen brothers\\' take on the Cormac McCarthy novel is calculated to give you the willies.No Country For Old Men bears McCarthy\\'s unmistakable stamp, and the equally unmistakable mark of filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen, making a strong return after a few years off.Like the best of Alfred Hitchcock, it\\'s easy to imagine the movie casting its sinister spell on audiences for years to come.I just don\\'t like it very much.... edge-of-the-seat suspenseful.So ferociously acted and executed that it practically takes a bite out of you. You won\\'t believe how great it is.Long the merry pranksters of the cinema, the Coens have given irony a vacation.It\\'s their best work in a while and it\\'s probably going to end up being the year\\'s best movie.This measured yet excitingly tense, violent yet maturely sorrowful thriller marks the first time the filmmakers have faithfully adapted somebody else\\'s work to their own specifications and considerable strengths.The ending is so lame it made me feverish. Then I remembered the perfection that came before it, and concluded that this is, without question, the best movie ever made by the eccentric Coen brothers.This is the Coen Brothers\\' leanest and least affected film since Blood Simple.Bleak but beautiful, and with characteristic Coen shafts of gallows humor,...about as perfect as a film can get...a shocking and mesmerizing experience.The Coens know how a thing or two about pacing, and it\\'s relentless here. The story is full of unexpected twists and switchbacks, and opportunities for the audience to gear down and take a breath are few and far between.This film is an evil delight; adapted from Cormack McCarthy\\'s book, it\\'s filled with suspense, pitch-black humor and one of the most memorable villains in recent cinema.While No Country For Old Men is compelling from beginning to end, the film lacks soul.A return to glory for the Coen Brothers, a revisiting of the formula that worked so well for them in Fargo, but with a darker, more cynical twist.If I want wry lawmen and smart, calculating fugitives, I\\'ll get them from Elmore Leonard; and, if I want Leonard, I\\'ll take him neat, rather than slow-filtered, drop by drop, through a layer of Faulkner, then laced with the Book of Jeremiah.Here\\'s the gist: It\\'s a near masterpiece.The Coens squeeze us without mercy in a vise of tension and suspense, but only to force us to look into an abyss of our own making.Like The Crying Game, Pulp Fiction and other films that shift paradigms in mid-stream, there\\'s more happening than meets the eye....Stark and spare, it\\'s often a gasp-inducing, armrest-clutching experience.Audience members who found previous Coen brothers\\' works too precious can rejoice in this, their best film--close to an American masterwork.A dust-bowl Pulp Fiction, the movie is bloody, suspenseful, unnerving and, not incidentally, hilarious. The best Coen Bros. drama, without the twitchy mannerisms of Fargo.A Cormac McCarthy horror-mystery with all its ingenuity and without Hollywood compromise. Happily for literature, the movie retains the fright and power of the novel with its shock ending.I may be clearly in the minority on this movie. It will almost certainly be number one on my list of movies that other people liked and I didn\\'t.The film is powerhouse genre, touching in its strange, graceful arc towards total resignation, and tinged, as the best and purest of all American genre films are...The Coens\\' first film since their leaden remake of The Ladykillers is an exceptional return to their Blood Simple roots, offering up a crime saga in which money is almost as irresistible as bad choices are inevitable.Against the whisper of wind and buzz of flies, the Coens manage to find tension in the subtlest of movements and cut the dialogue through with humour as arid as the landscape.Jones graces the film like an elder statesman.A quirky and bloody meditation on the rising tide of violence in America by the Coen brothers.Feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it\\'s an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who\\'s usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones.The most searing film I\\'ve seen this year.In adapting this most un-Coen-like material, the brothers have come up with a winner: an action film with a serious philosophical undertone.The Coen Brothers have gotten their mojo back with the help of Cormac McCarthy.This is one of [the Coens\\'] best films, yet, its indelible images resonating long after the final credits roll.It could serve as a model of prose-to-film adaptation, choosing exactly the right moments and movements for the picture, and leaving alone others that are better suited to literature.No Country For Old Men is a strong addition to the Coen Bros. shelf and will certainly please fans of crime stories while exciting action aficionados. And both groups will chuckle more than once.It\\'s the Coen\\'s masterpiece.A terrific return to form on a par with Fargo and other Coen classics.This is a film that pulls no punches - it\\'s brutal, violent and at times perverse. It is almost sadistic in how it removes all sense of catharsis from the audience, yet does so with such grace and efficiency that you\\'re constantly shaking your head in amaWritten almost exclusively in taut dialogue, the book already reads like a screenplay, and the Coen brothers have taken full advantage.A stark modern-day Western featuring Javier Bardem as the creepiest movie psycho this side of Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs.The most ambitious and impressive Coen film in at least a decade, featuring the flat, sun-blasted landscapes of west Texas and an eerily memorable performance by Javier Bardem.No Country delivers, with suspense scenes as taut as they are acutely observed.In a sense, the film is a lament for old certainties which are cruelly swept aside, perhaps purged would be more accurate, by Bardem\\'s extraordinary monster.There is a positively chilling performance from Javier Bardem as an embodiment of human evil to match Dennis Hopper\\'s memorable turn in Blue Velvet.A brilliant example of how plot devices as simple as murder and money can be used to explore larger sweeping themes of mortality, morality and more -- while still delivering rousing, intelligent pure entertainment.The Coens\\' typically superior filmmaking sustains the electrifying mood for most of the picture, but they are undone by being too faithful to the source novel by Cormac McCarthy.A scorching blast of tense genre filmmaking shot through with rich veins of melancholy, down-home philosophy and dark, dark humor.Brilliant from first frame to last, this faithful adaptation of McCarthy\\'s novel is the Coen brothers best film to date, a masterpiece that\\'s mesmerizing as a thriller and meditation on the nature of violence in America.Bateman, whose name is usually mud when it comes to appearing in good movies, brings out the best in Smith the actor and the action becomes surprisingly fresh and funny. [At first] Hancock is great fun, quirky and hilarious... Smith especially proves every minute why he\\'s become the best in Hollywood. Then the movie takes an odd turn and goes into a whole other story, with different -- and deeper, I guess -- meanings.... the tape is an excellent way to have fun, without question. [Full review in Spanish]Hancock is funny and pretty fresh but finally gives up on idiosyncrasy, leaving you nothing much to discover.And if you\\'re still not willing to forgive Hancock, and least there is the scene where he shoves a guy\\'s head up another guy\\'s butt.Hancock is what happens when you have talented people working on quality material: it\\'s really a no-brainer that it works so well. Kicks into tired oh-it-sucks-to-have-superpowers territory and opens up a can of racial issues it has no intention of investigatingI have no problem signing on to recommend this. Get it? Signing on...John Hancock... nevermind.A few actors such as Clint Eastwood, marry substance and popularity. But very few. Most actors\\' egos lead them to slum in the box office. I\\'m reminded of this often when a major, talented actor opts for popularity instead of substance when the latter beck...an engaging and thoroughly innovative spin on the superhero genre...This is a different take on the superhero genre with an interesting, offbeat twist.A fun, fairly crisp opening hour gives way to a muddled, entirely unsatisfying ending.The trouble with Hancock is that its wry, reflexive commentary on the pressure of being Will Smith gets lost in the more typical reflexivity of the big-budget Hollywood fiasco.The strain of messianism in Will Smith movies is becoming ever more pronounced.It becomes an entirely different film, one not really premised on the bad-superhero comedy idea, and the film is then oddly without a sense of humour, and its vague interest in satire vanishes completely.A relatively satisfying ending that leaves just enough of an opening to warrant a sequel if the box office receipts are right.Train wrecks are intrinsically spectacular, and Will Smith\\'s new movie offers a doozy. Two of them, in fact.Smith and Bateman are great, and the first half of the movie is terrific. The second half...well, you\\'ll either go with it or you won\\'t.Will Smith, Fourth of July, superhero. It all seems to add up to a great combination. But they only made half a film.While the film never quite reaches an Alan Moore-level deconstruction of the superhero mythos, it has a fun time offering up all the joy of a big-budget action movie without taking things too seriously.The most adult of the new wave of superhero dramas.Has plenty of funny, even tender moments until it veers in a different, messy direction an hour in.It\\'s let down by a disappointingly uneven plot, painfully underwritten characters and dodgy effects.It\\'s definitely a mish-mash, but really good performances.Squeezing every bit of originality out of its concept, Hancock fails on so many levels that it\\'s surprising the film isn\\'t a bigger success with audiences.Less like a complete movie, Hancock plays out more like the first two episodes of a television series shown back to back.Most of Hancock\\'s faults can be forgiven because Will Smith creates a quintessentially American hero: flawed, frayed, but always sacrificing for the sake of others.Hancock suggests the Colin Powell \\'Pottery Barn\\' argument, but before it gets really interesting, veers wildly off course.Hancock is a movie that tosses the genre cookie cutter under the bus.Hancock isn\\'t by any means a dead loss, but it could have been a lot better.It\\'s a pointless, plodding and just plain ugly effort which fails on just about every level.The phony mythos turns into equally spurious pathos that plays like bathos because not one iota of the sentiment or sympathy has been earned.Smith\\'s invincibilty at the box office may come down, for this film is a mess. Not even his charm and personality can save this train wreck.There are more problems afoot than just its misleading rating, beginning with the story itself.The structure of Hancock is a bold risk that supplies more storytelling ambition than your more typical summer popcorn blockbuster.Hancock tries to reinvent the superhero movie - until it loses interest in its own story.After a frenetic and funny first half, \\'Hancock\\' falls apart, devolving into a sentimentalized and scattershot piece short on integrity and sense.It feels like a couple of reels are missing... devoting an enjoyable first hour to our dirtbag crusader\\'s unlikable antiheroics, before jumping to the conclusion without benefit of a second act.It\\'s certainly the most complexly ornery superhero flick we\\'re likely to get this summer.The special effects feel rather synthetic for a big-time summer blockbuster. When the smoke finally clears Hancock emerges as just another routine riff on the superhero genreAn interesting idea, but it falls a bit short of being a compelling story.While by no means a perfect film, I still found a lot to enjoy here. There have been at least two dozen superhero movies in the last six or seven years. It\\'s kind of nice to see one that looks at things from the other side of the coin.An unfocused, ill-conceived, and rather ridiculous Smith vehicle...A disappointing mishmash.... the bottom line is that, as far as botched movies go, Hancock is a painless way to pass a couple of hours enjoying a mindless summer popcorn movie....a tale of redemption hard-won, and all the more rewarding for that.Morally bankrupt. And this is coming from someone who thinks Ted Bundy was misunderstood.The acting matches the actionThe more we get to know about Hancock and how he acquired his name and mysterious powers, the less entertaining it becomes.There are lots of interesting ideas and some fine work on display, but it never gels into a fully satisfying movie experience. Like its titular super-anti-hero, it only works sometimes.The dynamic between the sullen Smith and sincere Bateman may be the best thing in the Peter Berg\\'s movie, but it\\'s a tough call because the whole popcorn fest is flat-out fantastic.See-saws between straight superhero movie and parody, with layers of soap-opera fudge in between. A lot of solid scenes - but Hancock lacks the power of super-coherence.His symbol is the eagle. He beats up on little Frenchmen. He is \\'the only one of my kind,\\' the world\\'s lone and lonely superpower. Hancock is a clever metaphor for America in the world.Here\\'s a movie filled with bright ideas, crammed uncomfortably into a story burdened by confusing and often contradictory exposition.About halfway through the film it shifts gears... One wishes [they] had focused on a single story and saw it through.A superhero movie with soul, a magically endowed boozer, and quirky chemistry fueled between those two dramatic heavyweights, Will Smith and Charlize Theron, who go at it like Hillary and Obama duking it out at a presidential primary.This summer has been defined, over and over, by boys maturing into men... Hancock is by far the most thoughtful exploration of this issue.Fate, mythology and even racism in America are tossed in to a climax so grim it\\'s like watching \"Men in Black\" morph into \"Requiem for a Dream.\" The movie doesn\\'t earn that drama, feeling cobbled together from earlier, less-commercial drafts.A peculiar and occasionally charming poke in the ribs of the superman myth.As popcorn movies go, this is fleet, funny, and even thoughtful: its central question, nicely underplayed by director Peter Berg, is why power and altruism never seem to intersect.Why on earth anyone would want to waste a summer matinee afternoon with Hancock when they could get wasted with Shakes the Clown in the DVD privacy of their own lair?While not a total failure, what would the result have been had director Peter Berg been able decide what he wanted his movie to be? As it stands, Hancock is a wildly uneven ho-hum affair that really should\\'ve have been much more.Hancock\" is a mess of a movie, a bizarre combination, believe it or not, of \"My Super Ex-Girlfriend\" and \"Breaking the Waves.The shaking and almost random cutting destroy the movie\\'s timing and humor, though Smith is skilled enough to sneak a few laughs through.Feels like they shot the story treatment without ever bothering to turn it into a screenplay....the film is full of empty patches: not plot-holes exactly, but spots where it seems we aren\\'t getting a full movie.[A]bout three-fifths of the way in, things take a sudden turn....While this switcheroo has put off many critics, it is precisely what I found most interesting...Something big and different during that time of the year when something big and different is so rare.It\\'s like dating Britney Spears. Too much drama.A slightly messy movie, but it\\'s also one of the year\\'s best.Don\\'t expect to laugh more than five times and you won\\'t be disappointed.Hancock is not the light and fluffy comedy you may think it is - it\\'s dark and coarse, but well worth checking out.Hancock is a rarity. It\\'s an action yarn that feels like a drama and, alternately, a drama that takes our breath away with bursts of eye-popping action.I\\'m willing to give a superhero film some leeway in terms of realism but a film has to remain true to its own inner logic and this one keeps changing the ground rules.The problem is that director Peter Berg, aided and abetted by Smith and Theron and third banana Jason Bateman, seem to have made it literally, not realizing its out-of-whack tonalities and grotesque plot twists were meant to be played for laughs.The good cast does what it can with the weak material, but the waste of talent only makes the film\\'s total failure that much more regrettable.Hancock leaps fluidly from comedy to action to romance. And it has bigger surprises in store.As soon as the hero becomes another wounded demigod brooding on rooftops, the movie loses its sting.Ill-conceived and oddly executed, this Will Smith vehicle perplexes more often than it entertains.Hancock makes for one unexpectedly satisfying and kinky addition to Hollywood\\'s superhero chronicles.There\\'s a great idea here, but it\\'s buried within a muddled story that lurches between dark comedy and maudlin drama.Drunk superhero comedy turns into ... something else, not all that successfully.Hancock can fly; Hancock can punch; Hancock is bulletproof. Regrettably these things don\\'t hold true for Hancock as a film, which starts promisingly enough, but ultimately gets knocked off course by a reveal of dubious dramatic value.Since The Pursuit of Happyness, actor-producer Smith has made no secret of his desire to make movies that entertain in that big-studio way but also dig deeper. Hancock is a rousing measure of that intent.... in spite of its flaws, I very much enjoyed Hancock, for both its interesting and creative storytelling and Smith\\'s great lead performance.A floundering action comedy with an interesting premise that self-destructs in its second half.As delivered by director Peter Berg, Hancock is never as serious or funny or poignant as it could be. And despite clocking in at a reasonable running time, it has a big sag in the middle that nothing could have fixed.Audience members willing to hop aboard this emotional roller coaster ride will respond to the resultant pathos far better than viewers wondering why the laughs suddenly went MIA.Will Smith and a great cast are not enough to keep this from becoming a soaring disappointment in this summer\\'s superhero movie sweepstakes.A few more films like these, and this will be remembered as the beginning of the end of his blockbuster career.Hancock\" is not a bad movie, just an underachieving one. It lacks a \"wow\" factor. It is bland and routine and flies off in too many directions.Hancock is an irreverent hero for our times--perhaps reflecting our own national zeitgeist, with America\\'s previously untainted superpower image suddenly a matter of debate rather than fact.... where [director Peter] Berg makes it work is by refusing to sacrifice the integrity of his characters for an easy ending.Hancock is still a lot of fun. Will Smith remains one of the most likable of movie stars, and he\\'s a virtuoso of underplayed sarcasm.Has action, heart, but superhero is an alcoholic.The tragedy of \"Hancock\" is that Will Smith is so damn good in it.Yet because it\\'s Smith, you know that Hancock can\\'t be all bad, and as the film spends the next hour trying to rehabilitate him, proceedings slowly starts to fall apart.John Hancock is a black superhero desired and derided by crowds who are informed by spectacles, stereotypes, and fear.[...]it\\'s always nice to see someone revisit Christopher Reeves\\' drunken Man of Steel act from Superman III.If Hancock didn\\'t try so hard to be \"edgy\" and \"different\" it could have been a winner. Instead with the only villain in the movie being a Whiskey bottle it barely registers as a blip on the radar.Hancock is a mess that isn\\'t even fun to enjoy for its little pleasures.Flashy and funny, but extremely uneven, this superhero action comedy lets its gifted cast stroll through a series of ill-defined charactersas daring and audacious as its eponymous hero, venturing into realms of mythos and sentiment with equal dexterity and eruditionHancock is either a brilliant disaster or an often uneven masterwork.Only half a good movie -- the whole of it becomes confusing, disappointing, and non-sensical.Even Smith needs good material, and it\\'s fitfully supplied here.This antihero merely spreads his suckage filmwide.Has a promising premise.Remember Wild Wild West? Well...A promising idea about a superhero with an existential crisis wobbles through wildly misjudged moments and then has something of an existential crisis of its own.Best as a comedy and worst when it tries to get serious.It doesn\\'t take itself as seriously as it should, and undercuts a final act that should have and so could have packed a mighty emotional wallop.Despite having a few \\'wow\\' moments, this is one of the more frustratingly inconsistent movies in recent memory.Part of the joke lies in seeing a megawatt star embrace his inner grouch with fantastical blunders, and part of the anticipation lies in seeing Hancock become, well, Will Smith.To be sure, Hancock mines the superhero mythology and pays homage to the rich folklore on which it feeds and sustains itself, but what it does with the raw materials is thoroughly, refreshingly unique.No one can tell a coherent story anymore, and before long no one will notice.Setting out to be both a parody and the very thing that it\\'s parodying, the movie comes up short on both accounts.A new movie that makes the previous pandemonium seem downright restrained.There were many moments where I was going from nail-biting to knee-slapping.Director Peter Berg knows the difference between cartoon violence and the real stuff, and Hancock mixes both to good effect.You have to admire any summer blockbuster that freshens and subverts the superhero genre, and you\\'re in fine hands with these actors.It\\'s worth it just to see a ready-made Superman-sized superhero in action without all the baggage of decades of retellings and reworkings; even looking at familiar faces working through a familiar genre, it\\'s nice to be surprised for once.Smith\\'s pictures deliver familiar pleasures; they work with efficiency but not inspiration, honoring the time-honored movie platitudes that will neither shock nor stretch an audience.Hancock the jaunty, jokey riff on the screwed-up inner emotional life of a traditionally ironclad superhero becomes Hancock the icky lesson in the importance of personal responsibility, loyalty, and continued family togetherness.Credit must be paid to director Peter Berg for pulling off such a tricky balance of such diverse elements while delivering an impressive and affecting superhero adventure with as much heart and soul as sound and fury.But for most of its running time, Hancock is a refreshing piece of cinema that should be another solid summer hit for Smith.Hancock is a giant mess of a movie. It\\'s not just misguided, it\\'s insulting.There are some moments when it looks as though it is somehow going to work but then, much like its anti-hero, it comes crashing back to Earth, leaving nothing behind of note besides a giant mess.The attempts to deepen the emotions turn Hancock into a strange, conflicted and often joyless film.There\\'s a game-changing plot twist that is at first fascinating, but ultimately infuriating because the movie never capitalizes on it.A fascinating film about exploitation as it applies to blacks and the entertainment industry.While Hancock certainly isn\\'t lacking in ambition, unfortunately it does lack coherence.Between the jittery pseudo-realism of Peter Berg\\'s direction and the maudlin undercurrent to its hero\\'s redemption, all Hancock can summon up is the faintest sensation of nausea.Another great departure for Smith to put his charm and popularity to the test, offering more than a few solid laughs within an original superhero premise.The bottom line, of course, is Will Smith who carries the film and salvages things even while the story falls apart all around him. The guy has charisma to burn, and makes Hancock appealingMost of the film is zippy, funny, and fascinatingly strange -- all qualities that are often lacking in some of the more bloated action blockbusters.The superhero genre screams for a makeover, or at least a smart deconstruction, but Hancock isn\\'t that movie. It just ups the foolishness ante.The strain of sadism that\\'s crept into mainstream American movies eventually overtakes and undercuts Hancock, which should embarrass the filmmakers, who pay lip service here to gooey idealism.A strange but cool comedy.even with Smith\\'s considerable charm and his proven track record as Independence Day weekend movie god, Hancock doesn\\'t succeed as a truly satisfying holiday-movie blockbuster.The second half gets so worked up over itself that Hancock becomes nearly unrecognizable as the movie we were all enjoying twenty minutes earlier.Leaving behind the laughs for schmaltz, Hancock chickens out at the last minute, lurching toward a cop-out happy ending that gives every indication of having been reshot at the behest of test audiences. Well, at least you won\\'t be bored.Passable if profane, Hancock chugs along right up to that when this comic superhero engine goes off the tracks, and pretty much off a cliff.As for Smith, he\\'s on fire. There\\'s nothing like a star shining on his highest beams. You follow him anywhere.Hancock is still worth seeing, if only for a glimpse of what might have been a truly innovative idea.Hancock is a lot of fun, if perhaps a little top-heavy with stuff being destroyed.Initially, it seems like Hancock is going to have some fun with the superhero paradigm, but this dark, muddled and tedious noise machine winds up being an inferior copy of that genre\\'s highlights.The basic truth everyone should know here is that, for all its savvy and slick promises otherwise, Hancock is an empty, ill-plotted and highly vulgar disaster that\\'s going to disappoint virtually everyone who takes the time to see it.A super-dud.The set-up is there, but the big payoff is a huge letdown.[Smith] should have pushed for a rewrite as \"Hancock\" only flies so far before degenerating into a lame and illogical \"My Super Ex-Girlfriend.In this highly superheroic summer of Iron Man and the forthcoming The Dark Knight, Hancock can offer only an A-list headliner in a D-list project.Hancock is a film that starts off promisingly, but takes a left turn about halfway through and literally comes apart at the seams.Hancock is horrendously disjointed and barely manages to tell a story, but I was delighted by its charisma and Will Smith\\'s unexpected middle-finger timing.Hancock is a hodgepodge of intriguing ideas that, if developed further or presented as more than throw-ins to a confused production, might have made for a unique superhero film.A ton of potential, but ultimately a mess.With great power comes great -- irresponsibility.Part of Smith and Berg\\'s subvert-your-expectations game plan involves a major midfilm shocker, one that takes the movie to larger mythological places unrelated to Hancock\\'s self-improvement quest.Hancock is the sort of Fourth of July cinematic fireworks celebration Hollywood dreams about but rarely achieves.Thanks to Smith, it\\'s a story about movie stars -- and why the multiplex-going humankind needs to have them kicking around, too.This superhero saga fizzles.That pain in your neck is cinematic whiplash.It\\'s a strange feeling to see the summer\\'s most promising premise self-destruct into something bizarre and unsatisfying, but that is the Hancock experience.What does one say about a movie that wants laughs from a shot of one inmate\\'s head up the derriere of another?Almost any moviegoer should be able to find something to enjoy, but it\\'s hard to imagine anyone liking this mishmash from beginning to end.What starts out with a sense of quirky fun loses direction and devolves into a mishmash of story lines.The promise is dangled yet never developed. Rather, the narrative slips into a backstory that alternates between confusing and contradictory.The final third seems all shot in a strange blue light that makes even the gorgeous Theron look consumptive, and is, in a nutshell, no fun at all. Aren\\'t Fourth of July movies supposed to be fun? No fireworks this time, Will.It\\'s the sort of role Smith ought to be able to pull off easily. But even his superpowers apparently have their limits.There are many joys to be found in Hancock, not the least of which is Smith\\'s effortless performance...If you thought you were in for something light-hearted, prepare yourself for more superhero angst than Batman Begins and Hulk combined.By the expedited conclusion it all feels less like a Peter Berg film and just another chapter in Will Smith\\'s tentpole history of major creative failures.Director Peter Berg mounts a special-effects extravaganza that\\'s very boring indeed, and doesn\\'t quite deafen us to the inadequacies of the script, while Smith pretends to be a grumpy git but, naturally, winds up begging us to love him.The filmmakers cannot resist embracing the conventions they were tweaking. Hancock turns from a moody, darkly funny character piece trimmed out with a bit of engaging action and veers into a poor impersonation of a standard superhero movie.Hancock\\'s light-hearted comedic elements sit uncomfortably next to its more \\'adult\\' cussing and violence . . .Hancock suggests new visual directions and emotional tonalities for pop. It\\'s by far the most enjoyable big movie of the summer.The action comedy, a biting satire of superhero mythology and the comedy that results from its real-world applications, makes you love the guy for his brutally logical demeanor.Frenetic, forgettable and unfulfilling. Even Will Smith looks uncharacteristically uncomfortable.A bunch of strange, vague ideas crammed into a movie with nowhere to go and absolutely nothing to show us.I love surprises and would happily be led up the garden path with Will Smith, but there\\'s a fatal flaw to Hancock, with alien-sized plot holes and worse still, characters behaving out of context.A clumsily executed, forgettable mess that\\'s too dark for kids, too dull for teens and too dumb for adultsSheds essential exposition in a mad, foolish dash to the finish line.Subtlety and nuance take a summer vacation.Sadly, the bar is set too high and the movie implodes under the weight of its own ambitions.I\\'m not so sure Berg is losing faith that his audience can follow along...but in the face of so many comic book films entering theatres, it seems a poor choice to differentiate yours by way of tacky TV-level antics.Smith clearly has fun sending up his image.If Will Smith can pull off this hodgepodge of a movie, an ill-conceived poorly executed effort that tries to be all things to all people, then he really is Hollywood\\'s most bankable star.For a robust action story about three people from very different backgrounds attempting to make a positive influence on their world, \"Hancock\" is a step in the right direction.This misguided attempt to wring a novel twist on the superhero genre has a certain whiff of The Last Action Hero about it.Great concept, shaky execution.There\\'s enough good stuff to justify action fan attendance.No surprise to me, because I fully expected it to be awesome.nannannannannannannannannannanA lazy little product of mediocrity that will be woefully outdated in the next year...High production values and seemingly endless celebrity cameos only moderately elevate the scattershot satire of the Scary Movie franchise.In a quarter of a century who\\'s even going to remember that Tom Cruise went on Oprah\\'s show and made an ass of himself?A low-brow comedy chock full of cheap laughs.There are some laughs in this latest installment.A film with more chuckles then guffaws, hopefully the producers will settle on better movies to make fun of next time around.full review in GreekIt hits a few broad targets and misses many more, leaving the door open to continue the series indefinitely.There is a certain slapdash energy and heedless silliness to the proceedings that is somewhat engaging, certainly more so than the hateful likes of Date Movie.The humor is supposed to come from the recognition that another movie or entertainment world incident from the pages of Us Weekly is having fun poked at it.This franchise will never make the history books, but, you know, if they have to keep coming, this is probably the best of the lot, with more laughs than you might expect.Too much potty humor -- and not enough inspired comedy -- sink this fourth installment in the SM franchise....most of it was unfunny...Even [Anna Faris] must recognize that the series has turned into the cinematic equivalent of a flat bicycle tyre -- it starts off with lots of air in it, but can quickly go flat when punctured.Some hearty laughs, but there\\'s also a lot of effluence-based humor to wade through.This time out, what\\'s scary is how boring and unimaginative the series has become.If you\\'ve had a hard week, it provides a healthy dose of whatever.The film quickly abandons biting sarcasm in favor of gumming you to a sloppy, slow death.David Zucker, who once had one of the most supple comic touches in the business, has turned into the chowderhead who keeps elbowing you in the ribs asking, \\'Get it? Get it?\\'The first moments, drawn from Saw, feature the two least professional and most engaging performers: Dr. Phil and Shaq are chained in the basement and their escape depends on Shaq making free throws, which he cannot do, er, to save his life. Every scene looks like it was thrown together in two sloppy takes.Who doesn\\'t like a good Charlie Sheen / Viagra gag? I mean, besides Heidi Fleiss... The law of diminishing returns is in full effect here -- there are a couple of inspired gags but most fall embarrassingly flat.The humor is mostly flat and obvious, but Anna Faris\\' ability to maintain a straight face as well as her dignity under the most demeaning of circumstances continues to impress.There\\'s possibly nothing sadder in the world of cinema than a comedy trying this hard for laughs.The cleverness dies slowly in this horror spoof ... reaching bottom with a bevy of bathroom jokes and the offal appearance of Leslie Nielsen as a dithering, Bush-league president.What makes it to the screen feels pretty joyless.Unspectacular but hardly disastrous comedy.You know exactly what you\\'re going to get, and you get it. Is that so wrong?The jokes miss more than they hit, but there are a lot of them, and when they work, it\\'s gold.Cheap laughs are better than no laughs at all.There\\'s a kinda/sorta plot going on here that strings together a bunch of gags, which work more often than not....a cockeyed collection of watered-down, lowbrow parodies that have all the revered spark of a joy buzzer jolting an arthritic patient during a spontaneous handshake.If you enjoyed any of the previous Scary Movies this one will likely appeal to you. The humor is broad, but much of it hits.The entire film is predicated on turgid slapstick bits that simply congratulate viewers for having seen a handful of recent studio blockbusters.For those jonesing for a loosely connected string of comedy sketches, heavy on the scatological humor, this is the fix.We\\'ve been assaulted with Brokeback parodies for the last five months -- who the hell needs another one now?Much of the humor feels tired and unfunny, and David Zucker\\'s directing sags where it should zing.It\\'s a far cry from the hilarious, edgy antics of Scary Movie, but it has about as much going for it as the first sequel.A throw-it-at-the-wall-and-see-if-it-sticks onslaught of potty jokes, puns, celebrity cameos, J-horror, and j-high sophistication and wit. You get laughs, but not nearly as many as you\\'d hoped.There are relatively few laughs -- unless you crave toilet humor -- in this direct-to-video-grade installment.There\\'s only so much humor left to wring from the pup tent of Brokeback Mountain or the matted-hair fetish of the Japanese horror genre.The latest example of cultural degeneration: The stupid Scary Movie franchise now has one more entry than the smart, satiric Scream series it originally set out to spoof.For people who like this sort of thing, this is just the sort of thing they like.It\\'s not particularly good as a movie but as a collection of jokes it\\'s pretty sublime.Four installments later, the horror-movie jokes have gotten broader, grosser and just plain dumber.The three preceding Scary Movie films were all bad, yet, nevertheless, better than this.The perpetual engine of the unkillable Scary Movie chain is toxic cynicism.The early promotional screening forbade internet press even though there was nothing to be afraid of. It is a cleverly integrated spoof. For every sharp one-liner or bright sight gag, there are five clunkers, including played-out references to Russell Crowe\\'s phone-throwing incident and a lazy jab at Michael Jackson\\'s fondness for little boys.The Scary Movie franchise is running out of steam pretty fast. They\\'re still funny, and the gags still work. But there\\'s only so far you can go with it.For slapsticky, loose-limbed, MAD Magazine-style movie satires, you can do no better than the works of director David Zucker.Zucker and his team don\\'t seem to be trying anymore.Why must Hollywood torment so those of us with IQs in the triple digits?I really hate to admit this, but the film made me laugh on several occasions.for die-hard fans for whom there is no such thing as a poop gag taken too far and there can never, ever be too many Brokeback Mountain parodiesstill an overabundance of potty humor but as far as this franchise goes, I\\'ll take improvements in baby stepsStars Anna Faris and Craig Bierko display great comic timing, which is sad considering how little they have to work with.... a barrage of low-minded gags with high-spirited energy.Like the gags, many of the cameos don\\'t pack a whole lot of punch, but enough succeed so that the viewer leaves with a mildly favorable impression. Regrettably, this is probably more a function of human psychology than moviemaking skill....a hodgepodge of tired jokes that is occasionally goosed by a good idea, an inspired cameo, or the comic chops of its main cast, particularly Faris. Not surprisingly, the fourth installment is a total retread of its predecessor.Watching the movie is quite a bit like reading a slightly out-of-date Mad magazine or, I guess I should say, quite a bit like I remember Mad as a seventh-grader.The gags are hit-and-miss, and regardless of their success, they categorically go on too long.Isn\\'t it amazing to see just how low some people will stoop if you pay them just enough money?I just don\\'t see much entertainment value--or, certainly, a shelf life--in a contrived string of mildly amusing parodies of bad movies.

Fans of American animation and lowbrow humor are in for a real treat.Not only its a hysterically raunchy and jaw dropping comedy, but manages to have food for thought with a risky theme that you don\\'t see in many films.When it finds the Party, the movie brings down the house with a final half-hour bacchanal that\\'s the definition of stoner sublime.As a religious satire, Sausage Party is about as subtle as crucifixion and it goes way too far, but the odd line is a zinger.The film surprises you because apart from being hysterically jaw dropping funny, its\\' ideologies and themes throughout are somehow inexplicably meaningful.A hilarious, vulgar, crude, smutty film that will have you snickering at jokes you\\'d like to think that you\\'re above.I feel dirty because I saw this and I feel dirty because I want to see it again.

That\\'s the highest praise I can give it-Sausage Party is a rib-sprainer.If it takes a film about an animated sausage and a bun, laced with toilet humour and extreme sexual puns, to provide a modern-day existential critique of the lunacy of human nature and modern racial and religious discourse, then I\\'m all for it.Candor that has no substance beyond easy stereotypes is just depressing.To be fair, there are hints of an interesting perspective shift, and at the heart of it all, a curious darkness. . .But the writing never really develops much further than the laziest of tropes.The surprising thing about Sausage Party is that its desire to swerve from the norm with dirty humor is evened out by an equally strong impulse to bolster those norms.The teenager who lives inside your head will giggle, while the more highly evolved parts of your brain might wonder if it is a Trojan horse for parodying xenophobia, extremism, and sexual repression.How much fun you have will depend on your tolerance for a diet of non-stop swearing and filthy innuendo.

They lob in a good few c-grenades for good measure too.Although is not for everyone, Sausage Party is an irreverent animated comedy with a surprising depth and social criticism. [Full review in Spanish]From sly, not-so-sly innuendo to unfiltered climaxes, there\\'s not a moment in this movie that isn\\'t packed with jokes. And the thing is, it works.

It\\'s just not a great film, and ends up being more of a Sausage Soiree than a Sausage Party....a novel idea that gets stretched way too thin.At the very least, it\\'s better for American film culture that this exists than if it didn\\'t. I did not expect much of this movie, but it turned out better than I expected. It is very funny, with lots of jokes from movies and popular culture.... the junk foodie fantasy that stirs American Pie, Toy Story, Logan\\'s Run, and every torture porn horror of the last decade into a raunchy paean to hedonism with more food puns than a Catskills grocer. Without the proper comic nutrients, Sausage Party leaves viewers with a feeling of indigestion.An absurd and hallucinatory comedy full of scatological humor and vulgar language, and with a cast composed of notable comedians.

[Full review in Spanish]Despite the predictable narrative, it never fails to make you laugh because playing with food is vulgar and messy, but always fun. [Full review in Spanish]A very unusual movie that some love for the same reasons that others hate. Even though I really enjoyed it, I would have to know very well the other person before recommend this film. [Full review in Spanish]Less a talking-wieners \\'toon than a post-modern snack-mix of high-concept and lowbrow humour, socio-political parables and animation-spoofery-plus food-sex, injected bath salts, and Meatloaf\\'s rock \\'n\\' roll-this is a fairly bangin\\' bangers mash-up.I found this adult animated mockery most unpalatable.The jokes come thick and fast and hit and miss just as frequently.A tasty diversion.It may not be suitable for kids, but that\\'s not to say that this strenuously profane cartoon is not unapologetically juvenile in its approach to comedy.Dirty vegetables.Sausage Party isn\\'t high art, more a snack best washed down with a jumbo cola.Seth Rogen is a genius. Lucky, really, that I never liked hot dogs anyway.If you like your jokes raw and saucy, Sausage Part hits the spot.I got a lot of pleasure from Sausage Party, though not as much pleasure as the foodstuffs derive from the frenzied concluding orgy ...The film... very quickly passes its sell by date. This is clearly a film set out to shock, offend and, above all else, make you laugh.A crude, lewd, food-themed riff on Toy Story that basically functions as an animated parable about organised religion.Smart ideas and political satire battle it out with relentless smut in a decidedly uneven affair.What should have been a shamelessly filthy stoner movie has been watered down with ill-judged, undergraduate musings on religion, philosophy and race.It sounded like the dumbest movie of all time, but it\\'s actually smart, subversive and packed with famous voices saying wonderfully unspeakable things. In fact, it\\'s a banger.Re-watch value is extremely low with this one.As laugh-out-loud funny as it is jaw-droppingly offensive, this is hugely enjoyable comedy that actually has something to say.Consistently funny, frequently hilarious. Just don\\'t order one of those jumbo hotdogs before you take your seat - never mind the guilt, you\\'ll choke laughing.Sausage Party is rude, funny and unexpectedly profound in places, with the juvenile humour leavened by some thoughtful commentary on modern life.Existential howl of despair meets stoner belly laugh in the latest project from Rogen and collaborators, who follow \\'This Is the End\\' with another high-concept comedy that, like a horror movie, reduces its characters to meat.This animated comedy is decidedly not for kids; it\\'s rambunctiously filthy in more ways than one. And while it\\'s not exactly hilarious, it\\'s at least consistently amusing and has a positive attitude. Shamelessly pun-filled, sexually explicit, socio-political animation - for an adult audience.Reviewers who cynically boast that Sausage Party \"isn\\'t kids\\' stuff\" have it wrong...[P]roducer Seth Rogen... continues his self-amusement with self-congratulatory political satire.The final half hour or so is an exhilarating action sequence beautifully done, ending in a rather excellent sausage party indeed.One of the most effective parables about religion ever filmed.Groceries aren\\'t an obvious fit for the bawdy comedy of Rogen and his Superbad, Pineapple Express screenwriting partner-in-crime Evan Goldberg.

Its half-baked political ideas take away from the wholly satisfying and surreal Pixar riff it could have been.One of the more clever conceits is how it plays with the central conundrum of Pixar: How do you connect all these animals or toys or robots-beings that, to humans, have no emotions or thoughts or even faces-to the human world that they walk around in?Puerile and self-indulgent without a real laugh to be found. I have no idea how this gets released by a major studio, while Ralph Bakshi has to go to Kickstarter for a Vimeo release. Just say no. Like the sex, drugs, and politics that are fodder for the script, the question of what happens when we leave this world is addressed directly, and with the same fulsome sense of mischief.

Maybe it\\'s just too much.An audacious idea in need of a more adventurous script, taking this madness to the next level of brain-bleeding humor and commentary, securing itself as both an inspired farce and a Samurai-sharp inspection of sheeple culture.This smack in the face of good manners is surprising and strange, often delightfully so.Despite a few pokes at the folks from Pixar, nobody will lose any sleep over it. Obviously, these R-rated cinematic tricks from Rogen, et al. are not for kids.You can see the obvious social-political jokes being made, but it\\'s so juvenile.It is, without a doubt, the most delirious movie to come out of a major studio in decades, perhaps ever.I know Sausage Party is not made for kids, but they don\\'t have to try so hard to prove it.Sausage Party\" is smarter than it looks at the same time as it is overly taken with its juvenile humor.You might find yourself alone one night imagining your dinner screaming with every bite you take, and then wonder: Is that half-eaten slice of pizza plotting cheesy vengeance upon me... or am I the half-eaten slice of pizza?So many different shades of wrong all wrapped up in one movie that, even as I sit to write this, I\\'m unsure whether I was howling with laughter or begging for it to stop.A bold, visually exuberant fusion of provocative adult content with an art form too often chalked up as being strictly for kids, \"Sausage Party\" is something special.Consistently sophomoric, periodically hilarious, and peppered with minor stoner insights.There is no one out there making comedies quite like Rogen and Goldberg.

This is a film that starts out funny and ratchets up the insanity.Not only does the film effortlessly mock the sense of wonder and the emotional roller-coasters we\\'ve all felt watching Pixar\\'s big-eyed sentient objects, but, in its own messed-up way, it provokes some new feelings, too: shock and awe ...An effed-up funhouse. Rogen, a livewire satirist, dishes out an R-rated cartoon treat that tackles the crisis in the Middle East, the nonexistence of God and the sex lives of supermarket products.At a moment when news from our actual world so often seems a nightmare parody of itself ... there is sweet balm in seeing a bagel and a lavash overcome their differences to find mutual pleasure in one another.Almost never pushes the boundaries far enough, seemingly patting itself on the back for peppering the f-word into a cartoon with such frequency.Cranks the absurdity of the narrative and the anxieties in frightening, analogous real-world neuroses we cling to long past sell-by dates.

A gleefully vulgar and very funny spoof of the Pixar formula.As ridiculous as \"Sausage Party\" sounds, it actually manages to humanize the items we so violently slice, dice and devour. You may never look at a potato or bag of baby carrots the same way again.Literally bananas. And also nuts.A really funny, crass and often thoughtful comedy that doesn\\'t overstay its welcome.Created as the movie your perverted older brother made in high school but you can\\'t help but love him for it, the definitely offensive but enthusiastically rapturous romp is the surprise hit of the summer.Your mileage may vary, as they say. Also, hugs not drugs.If watching cartoon characters spout four-letter words is your thing, this might well be the greatest movie ever made. Rogen and Goldberg start with spoofery and work their way into something bolder and stranger; it\\'s as if playing in the Pixar sandbox, or a reasonable approximation thereof, can\\'t help but inspire creativity.You will come for the kind of humor promised in the title and the well-earned R rating, but stay for the nuanced meditations on theology and faith.Demented. And deep. The atheist equivalent of a VeggieTales movie.Imagine that the Pixar writers room dosed themselves with psychedelic drugs and went to their local supermarket to quench their munchies; the result is the perverse hilarity of Sausage Party.Its observation that life is full of cruelty and there is probably no afterlife and we waste most of our lives consuming images of a reality we cannot fully apprehend is pretty much true, but neither novel nor amusing.The script by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir has an inspired stupid idea, and boundless nerve, as well as a legitimate interest in theological debate.

It is occasionally witty, but not very often. It seems the filmmakers realized that as well as they fill the frequent dry spells with physical comedy that doesn\\'t really fit the tone of the movie.A limp romantic comedy, this cut-and-paste bookend to last year\\'s \"Hitch\" finds Sarah Jessica Parker playing Paula a demoralized romantic turned \"professional interventionist.Verging on the preposterous, director Tom Dey\\'s Failure To Launch relies on attractive stars to overcome its lackluster execution.Failure to Launch? The same can be said for the movie.Zooey Deschanel steals so many scenes as Paula\\'s anti-social roommate that she deserves to share top billing alongside McConaughey and Parker.It\\'s everything wrong with bad romantic comedies, all rolled into one easy-to-hate package.The movie\\'s notion of humor is exemplified by Bradshaw\\'s extended nude scene.A romantic comedy in the true sense of the word, \"Failure to Launch\" is the first certified \"date film\" of the year.As listless and phony as Failure to Launch may be, it does have one secret weapon in Zooey Deschanel.The multiple contrivances and the inevitable grinding of the storytelling gears will have you itching to go home -- whether you happen to live with your parents or not.i just hated every single character soooo muchAdd to this a confused moral message and it\\'s clear that, as its title inadvertently suggests, this romantic comedy never gets off the ground.It\\'d take a considerably more charming pair of leads to salvage a concept this lame and a screenplay this witless.One of those average romantic comedies that Hollywood churns out several times a year like widgets on an assembly line.The two times I did laugh, no one else did.Tom Dey directs with all the energy of a cook flipping burgers at Jack in the Box.As bland as corn flakes....logic be damned if this film needs an artificial catharsis to keep audiences from falling asleep.this rom-com dodges the unsavory omen of its title and once again demonstrates that predictable plots aren\\'t so bad if they involve Matthew McConaughey removing his shirt.What fails to launch is anything remotely convincing or appealing.Flimsy but fun, this rom-com has an enjoyable edge to it -- just don\\'t expect to remember much about it in the morning.It\\'s more of a \\'smile\\' film.A failure on so many levels, \"Failure to Launch\" is among the first of the lame, badly written romantic comedies that we\\'re doomed to see this year. And every year, for that matter.There\\'s nothing here a good dose of Viagra couldn\\'t cure. Impotent and dull as dishwater.As a romantic comedy this is very aptly titled, but it earns an extra star for Zooey Deschanel\\'s bonkers performance. They should have made the film all about her.... a classic example of a movie that isn\\'t as good as the sum of its parts, but those individual parts are surprisingly entertainingFailure to Launch shoots itself in the foot by refusing to take its premise seriously. The very thing that seems most interesting is the same thing that the film goes out of its way to avoid dealing with.When\\'s the last time the tightly clenched buttcheeks of a former pro football star tickled your funnybone?Everyone here is sour and detestable on some level, and though the film generates some chuckles and some interest due to its sheer quirkiness, we stare on in a freak-show kind of way.It sounds like a vehicle with plenty of comedy mileage, but Failure To Launch quickly runs out of steam.How, exactly, did an idea with this much star power and comic potential manage to misfire?There\\'s no spark in the romance because people in romantic comedies are simply not allowed to be people anymore: they\\'re hair and outfits inside a premise.I thought I was watching the Challenger disaster instead of a romantic comedy.Rather than address how personal idiosyncracies struggle in relationships, Failure to Launch exists in an appalling fantasy world of quota compliance.The writers ... have ideas that could be funny, but they don\\'t follow through on any of them.A film so egregiously bad that it really should be chopped into small pieces and buried under a freeway overpass.It\\'s completely unbelievable.Failure to Launch isn\\'t even a one-trick pony. It\\'s a no-trick pony. McConaughey and Parker try, but they can\\'t save a premise as insipid as this one.Not one of McConaughey\\'s best filmsFailure to Launch in a nutshell: constantly inching past your wildly low expectations. Some sharp dialogue raises this romantic comedy above the TV sitcom genre.Three months into the year and finally a decent romantic comedy hits theaters.A very aptly named movie.Even scrumtious manlyberry ala mode McConaughey cant save this fiasco. Failure to Launch fails to entertain - in the least.Once in a while, it\\'s just nice to have romance and comedy come together in a pleasant surprise.When the stars aren\\'t charming the viewer, the film is busy shooting itself in the foot.The film\\'s hit-to-miss joke ratio isn\\'t as favorable as you might wish.As date movies goe, this misanthropic misfire is briefly amusing but instantly forgettable.... the film lurches more often than it launches.Matthew Sexiest Man Alive McConaughey ought to be in Westerns, but not many are being made. So he plays a walking, winky pin-up in Failure to Launch, which may launch commercially but is a failure.This is a showcase for her [Parker\\'s] sensitive intelligence, her watchfulness, and her way of thinking and reacting. The Family Stone did nothing for Parker, but Failure to Launch makes a strong case for life after Sex and the City.Failure to Launch is yet another disposable romantic comedy made with little thought or skill.Failure To Launch, a funny but overly busy romantic comedy.There are zero sparks between [the leads]. ... It seems the only reason these two are together is because they\\'re both on the movie poster.It\\'s the lamest idea for a romantic comedy in recent memory, as well as one of the sorriest star vehicles in ages.What Failure To Launch doesn\\'t have is the crucial link between McConaughey and Parker suggesting they are indeed meant to be together and worth rooting for, more evidence that chemistry is the one special effect that Hollywood still can\\'t manage.This is a guy comedy being mismarketed as a chick flick, complete with a poster that looks like a page from Lucky magazine.The plot synopsis sounds less like sitcom than sick-com: A womanizer has the tables turned on him when he falls in love with, essentially, a prostitute whose services are being paid for by parents who don\\'t have the decency to ask him to leave.Director Tom Dey throws in so much energetic slapstick that the film feels lively and fresher than it probably should, especially during several scenes involving animal-induced mayhem.Like Tripp, Failure to Launch has a good heart but would be better off moving out of familiar territory.Failure to Launch stumbles its way to a happy ending without generating either much romance or comedy.As you\\'d predict, Tripp and Paula fall in love. It\\'s not very interesting. Then he finds out she\\'s a hired hand, he freaks, they split, they get back together, and blah, blah, blah.The comical part -- the part with the assaulting fauna -- is eccentric, knockabout fun, spattered with outlandish setups and amicably offbeat supporting players who reach out and steal the show.You\\'re tempting fate when you name your movie Failure to Launch. Especially when your movie\\'s as stubbornly earthbound as this one. Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker are two likable actors with the absolute worst taste in roles. At least putting them together means only one bad movie will ensue rather than two, individually.If you\\'re in search of a film with any real emotion or believable story, forget it. If you\\'re OK with a flick that has some funny bits and a kooky couple playing second banana -- hey, launch on.Parker does occasionally make us forget that Failure to Launch is so bereft of comic ideas that it ultimately stoops to giving Terry Bradshaw a nude scene to milk a laugh.The only thing I rooted for in Failure To Launch was for Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker -- the two leads -- to find better movies.Under Tom Dey\\'s direction, a perverse form of symmetry is at work here, and the stereotypes seem like old acquaintances you can enjoy for a couple of hours.The two TV writers have taken a premise ripe with potential for laughter and social commentary and turned into a hackneyed sitcom.Cursed with an honest title, Failure to Launch waves a white flag in scene after scene, declaring surrender.There are elements of Failure to Launch that elevate it, albeit sporadically, above the typical romantic comedy that it is.Failure to Launch\\'s\" unlikable lowlife leads are perfect for each other, considering that if they never met on Earth, they might someday cross paths in hell.There\\'s no question that it sounds good in concept. But in execution it amounts to little more than putting lipstick on a very old pig.The movie is surprisingly nimble and emotionally honest.The film goes a layer deeper than most formulaic chick flicks. It dabbles in the sociological aspects of why many present-day adults refuse to leave the nest, as well as the effect on aging parents.The movie is silly and cute, but spoiled by its own failure to be special.A decent start can\\'t save another run-of-the-mill romantic comedy snoozer.Failure to Launch thankfully doesn\\'t live up to its title. Bolstered by some quirky performances, it actually takes off in a surprisingly engaging way.If you looked up the word \\'fluff\\' in the dictionary, you shouldn\\'t be surprised if it shows a poster for this romantic comedy...the best scenes of the movie are unrelated to the overall plot and involve the supporting cast... If only the movie was about them instead.Whatever the opposite of chemistry may be, McConaughey and Parker have plenty of it... one of the few romantic comedies in history in which the couple\\'s fights are far more credible than their flirting.Paula\\'s practiced fraud sounds criminal at worst and grounds for civil suits at best, but to Hollywood, it\\'s a romantic comedy....downright repellent.... possibly the perfect chick flick/buddy flick hybrid... light enough, clever enough, and well-rounded enough to earn and entertain its target audience.[A]s nasty and misanthropic a piece of work as, oh, the entire genre of nasty-and-misanthropic \\'romantic\\' \\'comedies\\' we\\'ve been bombarded with in recent years... half of which seem to star Matthew McConaughey...If anything, the whole thing reeks of nothing more than a second rate pilot for a bad sitcom.Some movies are on auto-pilot from the get-go. Failure To Launch doesn\\'t even have a pilot.This is a bloated SNL sketch comedy film, complete with Terry Bradshaw nudity and a cast pausing for the audience to laugh.Failure To Launch tries very hard to break out of the romantic comedy formula with some additional wackiness and guy humor, but they might have been better sticking to the formula.It\\'s two things and both of them suck.Failure to Launch is a not-so-distant cousin of those happy-go-lucky herpes commercials that play on television--it\\'s so far out it scans as science fiction.This would-be romantic comedy is neither. The premise is misbegotten, the chemistry non-existent and the dialogue leaden.The stars are pleasant but unexciting, the goofy ensemble has a few moments of hilarity but never catches fire, the laughs are very scattered and the film\\'s title is a self-fulfilling prophecy.The movie casts around wildly for comic set-pieces, coming up with things like aggressive chipmunks, hostile dolphins and a dad who longs to be naked at all times.Every character has been given enough quirk to make the movie sublimely enjoyable but not so much that it becomes precious.You know that you\\'re in trouble when audiences leave the theater talking about the supporting cast with nary a mention of the movie starsTripp is such a stud that he has to beat women off with a stick. Or, rather, with his parents -- This isn\\'t just idiotic, it\\'s indefensible. It\\'s also the picture\\'s premise.It is a sweet and funny sitcom, but without an iota of originality.Oh, what stupid people these are.The title of the movie could also serve as its review.It\\'s fun stuff, overall, inconsequential and fluffy and not too cheesy until the end.This is a bright and bouncy date movie with some sharp lines and even sharper performances, especially from Bates and Bradshaw.As with most romantic comedies, Failure to Launch takes off thanks to its upbeat tone and the charisma of its stars.There are so many diversions in Failure to Launch, it\\'s as if the movie is bored by its own story.It\\'s good. Not brilliant, not a future Oscar contender, but a perfectly sturdy, sweet, pleasingly non-formulaic production that should amuse a variety of age groups.Failure to Launch isn\\'t about story. It\\'s about star power. Adjust your expectations accordingly.The stars execute their silly romantic-comedy dance steps as if to the manner born, but it is the funny shuffle-and-halt tango between Bartha\\'s computer nerd and Deschanel\\'s man-proof misanthrope that add some real zest.Even by the low standards of high-concept Hollywood rom-coms, this charmless, prophetically titled stinker stands apart, suggesting that the recent mass firings at studio Paramount may not have been such a bad idea after all.The movie is so intent on displaying McConaughey\\'s wares that it gives him a shirtless surfing scene -- and the picture is set in Baltimore.So limp and mirthless that it would barely pass muster as a single-season network sitcom.A bizarre, mixed up mess, but one with good moments courtesy of a solid supporting cast.Silly, lighthearted, funny - and despite a slow start, ultimately charms its target audience.It fails at romance and comedy. It fails to make the lead characters interesting and their love affair believable. And it fails to develop a consistent tone that would enable viewers to suspend their disbelief.Lively and enjoyable but nothing remotely special -- this could be just about any romantic comedy ever made, complete with a contrived premise and a bright cast to distract us from the same old formula.Relentlessly predictable and painfully unfunny...A total failure.Failure to Launch arrives pre-told by design. But even those coming in cold will know what\\'s going to happen one step ahead.a cloying mess crying for another rewrite, or maybe just the quick mercy of being plunked into the nearest trash can Launch writes itself into such a corner that the only way it can manage a happy ending is to lock its leads in a room and force them to have a meaningful conversation.A good alternate to the death penalty, watching this movie over and over and over. That, my friends, is what is called a fate worse than death.The title is perfectly apt -- and too easy a target -- for this romantic comedy that never shifts out of second gear.Beneath the sitcom sheen, there\\'s a darker movie about broken people who use convenient, pitiful excuses to keep from growing up. You laugh at them, but you also have sympathy.Sometimes a movie works because all of the ingredients come together so well. Failure to Launch is one of those movies. Failure to Launch is an especially slight romantic comedy whose modest charms are derived largely from its supporting players.Stars Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker put as much energy, winning smiles and comic business into their roles as possible, but it\\'s a no-go from the start.nannannannannanThe plot unravels rather than cranking up. The McGuffin with Spooner can be seen coming from a long way off, while the film jinks rather than twists towards its inevitable climax.A dreary action-mystery that spends far too much time mucking around a villainous plot that isn\\'t nearly as difficult to unravel as the protagonist makes it.Will Smith almost redeems generic man vs. machine actioner.Pretty to look at but there\\'s not much under the hood in this Isaac Asimov-based futuristic murder mystery...A lot of fun with excellent direction...It feels like an anonymous Hollywood studio film that overwhelmed the director with the demands to fashion a blockbuster vehicle for its star.The movie is at least a bit less annoying than director Alex Proyas\\' previous two genre attempts.Smith\\'s occasional sullenness suggests he is itching for another Ali-like chance to prove his acting chops even as he slums his way through another high-tech shoot-\\'em-up.Sonny, voiced by Alan Tudyk, is the equal of the other two leads both in his screen presence and the empathy he draws from the audience.If you are looking for proof that Hollywood has completely run out of ideas, check out I, Robot.As I, Robot details how Smith must fight for his survival against an army of white men whom he alone knows are evil, the film might have been called \\'I, Hollywood\\'.A thriller typically is only as good as its villain, and too many of them are bloodless here. Except for the hot-blooded performance of Smith... the movie is cool, right down to its color scheme.For those who like their sci-fi to have the depth and breadth of comic books....passable as a vibrating escapist flick in spite of Proya\\'s sporadically flat direction and the uneven interpretation of Asimov\\'s wry commentary An enjoyable action flick.A dull, derivative [film] with no new ideas and a main character who, while clearly simple-minded, is somehow the smartest guy in the story. Nobody is going to mistake this future noir for Spielberg\\'s Minority Report, but for a light-headed adrenaline rush, it works pretty well.The extras begin with an intelligent, interesting and thorough audio commentary by director Alex Proyas and writer Akiva Goldsman.A film so detached from Asimov\\'s vision, it emerges as a destabilized attempt at reworking an already-polished concept.Based on Isaac Asimov\\'s short story collection and directed by Alex Proyas, who did much better with \\'Dark City\\' and \\'The Crow.\\'This is jaw-droppingly juvenile and insulting to my intelligence. Perhaps its subject matter is obsolete. Asimov deserved better.An uninspired, recycled action thriller.Whether there\\'s anything substantial under the sheen and CGI of Alex Proyas\\' glistening future vision is debatable, but this enjoyable, engrossing picture is at least intelligently artificial.It may or may not come as a surprise, but Will Smith is out-acted by the robots.Better than anyone had any right to expect....The key to what makes \"I, Robot\" work is a well thought out script...A multi-villain axis of evil and a pulpy vision that feels machine-hacked.This summer picture has a brain as well as muscles.Proyas succumbs to the inane post-Matrix tendency to pump up action sequences with sudden moments of slow motion gymnastics that are almost laughableA B-movie blast about power and greedIt\\'s all mechanically done, but at least I Robot manages to be entertaining. rises above plot holes and stilted dialogue just enough to be a fun Sunday afternoon MatineeA-by-the-numbers action film retrofitted as a sci-fi work of art....better than I ever expected it to be on most levels. Props itself up with allusions to Deep Thoughts but in reality is just a long action movie gussied up in special effects.Far from perfect, but it\\'s entertaining, well-executed and definately worth a look.I, Robot succeeds where other movies that blend science fiction and mystery fiction have failed.A fun , surprisingly smart ride that is also true to the spirit of Asimov\\'s more thoughtful and low-key work....every once in awhile, this summer popcorn sci-fi movie provides a glimmer of Asimov...I, Robot is a disappointment not because of what it is, but because of what it could have been.Mixing animation and live action nearly seamlessly, I, ROBOT turns Isaac Asimov\\'s robot world into the backdrop for a prosaic summer action film.I, Robot is the meanest, meatiest, coolest, most engaging and exciting science fiction movie in a long time.For all its flaws, I, Robot is arresting to look at.I, Robot is the summer\\'s best action movie so far. It proves that you don\\'t necessarily need to detach your brain in order to walk into a big budget summer blockbuster.I, Robot fails to do much of anything other than take our money and repay us with some moments of CGI-induced spectacle and a handful of rehashed ideas.It\\'s good to know that, in the future, we can still thaw out a cryogenically-preserved Will Smith to save the world every July.Delivers the goods as a zippy piece of sci-fi pulp.I, Robot is that rare entry among summer blockbusters -- a film with something on its mind. A thinking person\\'s action picture ... it is definitely one of this summer\\'s better blockbusters.When \\'I, Robot\\' digs in to deliver the goods, it does so with first-rate action and special effects sequences that are thrilling.I, Robot is an enthralling bit of genre fiction; overcoming an uncertainty of focus with a handful of terrific scenes.Even with its flaws, I, Robot still computes to being a warm-weather winner.By adeptly combining action and ideas, it proves that Hollywood can still produce astonishing entertainment.Strives to be so many things that it ultimately falls away to nothing, a heap of expensive metal parts.While not a classic by any means, is still a mostly entertaining experience.I, Robot may not break much new ground, but it\\'s engaging enough in what it does to keep the viewer interested.It\\'s a good, workmanlike popcorn movie, but nothing moreThe plot isn\\'t very smart or exciting, but the action, including the scene in which the house is demolished, is spectacular.Maybe we should start having robots write movie scripts.It\\'s fun, sure, but uninspired. We\\'ve seen it all before... Will Smith does his old Will Smith thing again, with only the minimum level of actual entertainment to dress it up.Pretty to look at but as cold and removed as its title character. ... a slick, consistently entertaining thrill ride ...You hope for another \"Independence Day\" but what you get is another \"Wild, Wild West\".A robot must protect itself as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law, the Law of Thermodynamics, the Law of the Jungle, or Law and Order: SVU.Best of all, this is a story that\\'s actually about something.Good character development and the great on-screen chemistry between Smith and Bridget Moynahan also give this movie a big boost.Despite an admirable effort on the part of its creative team, this new technological thriller is at odds with itself from the very first moments.The message is old hat by now, but I, Robot is a genuine Will Smith Movie. What more do you need?It\\'s a flimsily sketched psychological sci-fi movie that never feels more than being robotic.[E]nough breathtaking visuals to make you forgive the movie its plot holes and its tendency to lapse into product placement parody. For the most part, this is thrilling fun.Succeed on its own terms as an entertaining mid-season popcorn movie.A failure of imagination.Performances, plot and pacing are as mechanical as the hard-wired cast.An unexpectedly engaging futuristic mystery.Despite its familiar, derivative, yet ironic, story, it\\'s a sleek, stylish, sinister fun-flick with a speculative metaphysical ending that makes you think.A CGI-laced action movie cum merchandising opportunity, warped into insensate silliness by the pop-iconic demands of Smith\\'s megabucks macho action-hero persona and peppered with stock cop-on-the- edge action-movie situations.Substandard Will Smith action-hero vehicle....what we basically have here is a summer movie disguised as a sci-fi epic. On that level, it works.[The screenplay is] good enough to keep things moving, to supply Smith with one- liners and to provide an excuse for the compelling backdrop.The film goes where you expect, with the rather programmed feel of a \\'classic\\' revisited with both money and zeal.This movie is blatant when it should have been subtle, and this is never more evident than in the unpleasant performance of its star, Will Smith.Smart and remarkably well-plotted.While I, Robot is consistently entertaining and considerably smarter than your average summer action flick, it\\'s never particularly exciting or emotionally compelling.A middling entertainment.Taken simply as a Will Smith Summer Blockbuster, I, Robot scores above average.I, Robot is everything a summer blockbuster should beMuch of the movie feels dull or derivative.Surprisingly smart, cool-looking, nicely paced and well-acted.I, Robot is fun, even when it relies a bit too much on standard police-procedure cliches.Will Smith is darker, sexier in his latest summer blockbuster... but despite an entertaining execution of Isaac Asimov\\'s robotic visions, it leaves you cold.It\\'s an intriguing mix, if not always a smooth one. Yet, to its credit, I, Robot never gives up on [its] ideas, not even at the height of all the sound and fury.Purely mechanical scenario owes much to robot-think, but little to Asimov\\'s scientifically informed humanism.Pretty good science fiction.May be slick, but it\\'s as cold and dehumanized as a robot.[Asimov] probably would have been \\'appalled by\\' this cartoonish creation.Plays like a compendium of summer blockbusters.A movie of its kind and of its time -- functional, professional, slickly manufactured and slouching toward consciousness -- I, Robot is a perfect slave to mechanical convention.As far as popcorn summer flicks go, this one\\'s error-free.Will Smith fans will likely be disappointed, and lovers of fine cinema best look elsewhere. But if you\\'re looking for robots going crazy, this one\\'s worth your money.Director Alex Proyas lays on the Tomorrowland awe of shiny metallics, techno-worship and fascist efficiency that make the future look like a nice place to visit.In the end, what will be remembered is how disappointing a treatment this is of some pretty revered source material.A watchable enough piece of summer entertainment.An engaging CGI-fueled ride.[A] self-important, derivative and muddled sci-fi thriller.The plot is simple-minded and disappointing, and the chase and action scenes are pretty much routine for movies in the sci-fi CGI genre.The sort of multiplex-buster that depends more on editing and production design than on story line.When Smith and Monaghan are interacting with Sonny the robot, you swear he\\'s a real person who just happens to look a bit odd....a Will Smith cop picture with the slight novelty of having robots as perps.Robots, explosions, gunplay, action, Will Smith...hmmm, it must be July.The Three Laws of Robotics still seem as fresh, compelling and provocative as ever. It\\'s an action thriller that races at breakneck speed and dazzles the audience, even if this program still has a few bugs to iron out....Thrilling, it\\'s intriguing and most of all, a lot of fun. It frankly takes a welcome \\'byte\\' out of every other blockbuster on show at the momentPerhaps some day the original Asimov stories will make it to the screen... [T]his I, Robot is one of the best science-fiction films we\\'re likely to see this year. Bad \\'bots, bad \\'bots, what ya gonna do?There\\'s no swifter way to ruin \\'not bad\\' than a reminder of something truly great... and for I, Robot, that reminder is never further away than the title.This Asimov-inspired adaptation is the rare summer blockbuster that supplies an actual science fiction story - albeit cleverly packaged to look like a \\'Will Smith movie.\\'An overbudgeted, underscripted, lazy piece of workSo the unlikely allies: A robot hater, a robot lover and a robot, all team up to solve the case. It\\'s kinda cute.A good story with one of two parts that malfunction - the wise-guy comedy is going to make the movie more commercial, but in this case, it hurts the story.A real missed opportunity - a potentially groundbreaking film reduced to a mess fit only for the slack-jawed mallrats that it is being aimed...Big-budget, big-effects tale of men and machines has a tiny imagination and a robo-crafted soul.It\\'s a Will Smith movie... with robots. It\\'s a brilliant concept, really.Filmmaker Alex Proyas finally finds the perfect balance between the real world and the one of his imagination, breathing humanity into a genre gleaming with artifice.A freshly microwaved mix of Blade Runner and Minority Report topped with a big dollop of cheese.I, Robot is a movie destined for fast-forward buttons the world over.The effects work here doesn\\'t break any incredible new ground or shatter any records, and yet this is one of the most visually impressive movies I have ever seen.More like Dorothy wandering lost through the great land of Oz, only without the heart of A.I., the brains of Minority Report or the courage of Blade Runner.Engagingly silly film.Ring-a-ding dull.It may not be Asimov but its plot is truly labyrinthine, it works a specific theme and it\\'s happy to end itself in a shroud of enigma.Easily this summer\\'s most welcome big-budget surprise, a studio film that isn\\'t afraid to ask its audience to think.Del\\'s repeatedly attacked by bad robots, marked by glowing red lights in their chests and behaviors not a little derivative of the first Terminator at his film\\'s end.A hunk of expensive, lifeless junk.I, Robot is the best kind of adventure movie, one that engages your heart, your sense of humor and your ache for a good yarn.A movie that never stops feeling like an advertisement for itself.I, Robot is less compelling as a drama of the human enslavement of androids than it is an intriguing vision of a treeless, cashless future.Awesome fx, poor story.\\'Suggested by\\' Isaac Asimov\\'s book of short stories, Alex Proyas\\'s hectic thriller engages some interesting ideas on its way to an overblown and incoherent ending.The film works best as a kind of mindless, action-packed B-movie. But on the A-level at which recent science fiction/fantasy films operate, this movie falls woefully short.I, Robot is yet another summer entree in which good intentions are stymied by excessive bric-a-brac.While it\\'s hardly a philosophical film, the screenplay by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman does have an idea or two.Those who are unfamiliar with Asimov\\'s work may enjoy I, Robot as a summer popcorn movie. It\\'s just unfortunate that it\\'s not more.Discerning horror fans will enjoy this futuristic science fiction actioner for its dark, sinister elements.At least it\\'s a beautiful crappy movie, and nearly worth seeing for the special effects and set design alone.Brickbat socialism in a dimwit populist entertainment. . . The film is about as subtle as a dump truck.

It\\'s one of the most interesting films of the summerOnly if you\\'ve never seen one before, it\\'s the best sci-fi movie ever made.

Maybe I should have my own wiring examined.Aesthetically dazzling.

This is a wide-scope sci-fi thriller done right.Androids may dream of electric sheep, but I, Robot\\'s multi-million dollar machines are remnants of summer films gone by.nannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannanIf you\\'re looking for something that\\'s a bit scruffy and off the beaten track, but still full of giant explosions, you\\'ll definitely want to check out Green Hornet.There are enough genuinely funny, self-aware gags and throwaway lines to keep you entertained.The whole film feels fairly self indulgent on Seth Rogen\\'s part. It\\'s rather dull and quite a letdown.Aside from the James Franco cameo, this story is one disappointment after another. This movie would a helluva lot better with paper mache sets.I like Seth, you like Seth. We all like Seth. BADLY miscast, here. And so was the director. A pleasingly average superhero movie whose greatest triumph is avoiding disaster.This had potential to be something of an action thrill ride, or at least a comedic, campy take on the usual superhero formula, but what we end up with is a directionless, pointless backdrop for blowing things up with some martial arts thrown in for kicks.A dud, that has a few bright spots.There are some good ideas here but they\\'re buried under masses of conventional superhero dross and half hearted execution. This is one vigilante who should really just leave all the hard work to the police.Hornet fans across generations will enjoy connecting this modern version to its pop-cultural roots stretching back more than seven decades, A childish film written from a grade school perspective with neither quality nor excitement.Derivative of several molds and unable to really take command of any of them.Aside from a brief split-screen sequence and a few deft special-effects, there\\'s almost no sizzle to this goofy take on superheroics....an uneven, disastrously overlong piece of work.Give me loose, idiosyncratic, comic meandering over stone-faced business-as-usual any day. It isn\\'t the movie you\\'re expecting, but it\\'s got its authors\\' grubby handprints all over it.For what problems it does have it is a genuinely different take on this kind of material with a firm focus on action, character and humor. No one else should ever attempt to make a superhero movie quite like this, but for The Green Hornet it works.Gondry and Rogen walk a fine line between fairly brainless bro-medy and occasionally knowing examination of the superhero genre.full review at Movies for the MassesPart origin story, part spoof, part bromance -- the movie can\\'t decide. It winks at itself constantly, but only to hide its cluelessness.Gondry\\'s biggest success is recognising that superheroes can still be funny, and embracing that in every part of this film.This is not the Green Hornet. It\\'s barely an action movie.Even if you \"get\" what The Green Hornet is trying to do, it is never terribly enjoyable.Really inventive.A facetious industrial product, and the first out-and-out bore of the year.One of those annoying movies that has enough good stuff in it that it can\\'t be dismissed out-of-hand, but enough deficits that one is hard-pressed to praise it. For a film with so many potentially hallucinatory avenues, imagination seems to be a worthless currency.It almost put me to sleep, and considering just how many explosions, near-escapes, fireballs, rockets and cracked heads it packs into its almost two-hour running time leading this viewer to the edge of narcolepsy is a pretty nifty trick.Seth Rogen, superhero? It\\'s nearly impossible to wrap the mind around such an outlandish idea, almost on the same level as Sarah Palin as U.S. president or Ricky Gervais as the next recipient of the Golden Globes Lifetime Achievement Award.Perhaps we should be grateful that The Green Hornet is a perfectly enjoyable Seth Rogen movie... But it\\'s a major missed opportunity when you consider the Michel Gondry spectacle that it came so close to being. Despite its obvious angling to become a franchise, this Green Hornet offers little that\\'s worth committing to even the \"cult flick\" chamber of your brain.Michel Gondry\\'s frivolous, exuberant film is a hard one to embrace.There is no grand sense of justice or even vengeance driving The Green Hornet; it is just that kicking ass might be fun, and it turns out it is.A bit shapeless as a story but relies on the charm of Rogen and a few big set pieces to connect the dots.An admirable yet underwhelming attempt at something a little different. While The Green Hornet is a passable time killer, cineastes might go into shock that such an unremarkable piece of Hollywood mulch was helmed by French whiz kid Michel Gondry.Even the direction of Michel Gondry is a wipeout. The Frenchman was a late recruit to the project, but precious few glimpses of his trademark surrealism are detected.It has more of a sting than you might think.Hornet lacks sting.I\\'d hoped for better, but expected worse, which means that Michel Gondry\\'s The Green Hornet is at best -- or at worst -- a mixed bag of a movie.It has what is expected of this kind of movie, cool visual effects, martial arts action, car chases, explosions, shootouts and lots of James Bond-style gadgets.It is a patchy film, haltingly paced, but the visual invention is astonishing.And now here it is, and we see it really was a joke after all. Thing is, it\\'s supposed to be. Despite the talent involved, this ends up an underwhelming superhero flick marred by dull action and non-existent chemistry between the cast.It\\'s hard to shake the sense of well-known figures cashing in on a superhero craze that doesn\\'t quite fit them, and trying to but never fully making it their own.Equal parts amusing and tedious - but not in any sense the disaster some have called it.The movie is extremely loud and none too funny.Chou steals the show, especially when he speeds into action in glorious Kato-Vision.It remains a rare franchise reboot where the sense of playfulness outweighs that of strained psychological depth or grim commercial obligation.Featuring an eclectic cast and unusual choice of filmmaker, The Green Hornet succeeds as an experiment done right.There\\'s just enough novelty, action and comedy in the tank to see this film teeter across the finish line, even if it does cough and splutter for much of the journey.It\\'s not a superhero film; it\\'s an exuberant anti-superhero film that exists with no agenda except to delight.Fun, full of action, and just serious enough to work without becoming ridiculous.The Green Hornet may well be Michel Gondry\\'s most elaborate meta-joke on escapist infantilism....loud and violent, if not annoying.Can a genius and an average Joe pair up and put egos aside to serve mindless adventure? Gondry and Rogen have. The fight scenes, filmed in what I\\'ll call \"Kato-Vision,\" are top shelf and rival anything you\\'d find in the \"Matrix\" world.A solid opening and a mayhem-laden third act cannot make up for an utter mess of a middle hour or for the utter lack of charisma by Jay Chou as Kato.This boorishly irreverent superhero sendup is a fiasco, sustained only by its FX.The Green Hornet attempts to mock its own genre, but it forgets to deliver a compelling characters along the way.Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, Cameron Diaz and Christoph Waltz try to bring their characters to life in this campy action flick -- but the results end up uneven at best. Seth Rogen\\'s character should have evolved with humility and authenticity by relinquishing his bogus stranglehold as The Green Hornet and becoming The Guy Who Smokes a Fat Blunt Better Than You But Only Kicks Ass Like Your Great Grandma.What should have been, could have been. It sure isn\\'t this Green Slacker.Team the acting and writing of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg with the artsy-fartsy directing of Michel Gondry and they\\'d turn Gone with the Wind into a quirky comedy.This is one occasion where too many cooks in the kitchen actually ended up making some pretty tasty junk food. I thought only flies liked piles of dung, but hornets must, too. Maybe that\\'s the reason for the evacuated pile titled The Green Hornet.Has there ever been a time when I wanted the hero to die so badly, as badly as in this film? No....rowdy, discordant, subversive and thoroughly modern, exactly what you\\'d expect when a stoner and a visual genius team up...Superhero movies often must deal with the problem of villains being more charismatic than heroes. But when your hero is so annoying that you find yourself rooting for anyone who could potentially take him out, it\\'s a real problem for the movie.An uneven, dull and painfully asinine action comedy that\\'s neither thrilling, funny nor visually stylish enough to deliver pure entertainment. Go rent Kick-Ass instead.When it works, which is more than half of the time of the time, it\\'s a cheerful little romp that refuses to take itself seriouslyGondry is an incredible visual stylist and he\\'s showing off in a way that fits perfectly with the loose style of the movie.Depending on where your tolerance level is for Seth Rogen, you may enjoy this movie or you may hate it. Still, it\\'s a fun ride and enjoyable to watch.The MVP is Jay Chou as Kato, who is as much Britt Reid\\'s superior as the valet Jeeves and the dog Gromit are superior to their alleged \\'masters\\' in the works of P.G. Wodehouse and Nick Park.Dumb, unfocused movie that is neither comedy nor action-thriller. Spews noxious gas and obnoxious patter.There are elements of a sharp hero/sidekick inversion here: Kato is the handsome, brilliant inventor and karate expert; Britt is, well, rich enough to pay the salary of someone like Kato. But the inversion is inevitably incomplete. The film wavers uncomfortably between parody and homage, between deconstructing the excesses of the genre and simply indulging in them.At least Seth Rogen has the good sense to wear a mask for much of The Green Hornet. If I\\'d made this movie, I\\'d want to hide my face too.This is an overlong, empty bore that squanders its possibilities.Absurd yet entertainingA big, sloppy, loud, grating mess of a movie.As a journalist, I can\\'t come down too hard on a film\\'s action scenes when they include a half of a car speeding through a newsroom and a shootout in an area where massive spools of newspapers are stored. A lively but sloppy update for Kato and the Green Hornet.As a crime-fighting duo, Britt and Kato have the sophistication and finesse of a pair of middle school boys on a joy ride.The Green Hornet is crass, unimaginative, unexciting, and not very funny. I was hoping it would at least be mindless fun but it ends up just being mindless. An action film that doesn\\'t excite and a comedy you never laugh at.The big-screen Green Hornet, while hardly classic comic-book filmmaking, ain\\'t half bad. Superhero \"bromance\" is funny but overly childish.If you enjoy watching a lead character that\\'s so annoying and such a jerk that you\\'d like to punch him in the face yourself, then The Green Hornet is for you.You\\'ll have an absolute blast watching The Green Hornet, but its constantly goofy demeanor takes some of the sting out of it.Slick, sly and ever-soslightly subversive, The Green Hornet is an irreverent comedy bound to annoy comic-book purists - usually a good sign - and sure to delight everyone else. Think this year\\'s Kick-Ass.The Green Hornet smoked crack with Superman and met CraigsList chicks with Wolverine. He\\'s a bad influence and a good time. And he\\'s much more entertaining on screen, too.Does it work? Yes, if you like Rogen, but if you don\\'t you\\'ll feel that Gondry has fiddled too much with the original by giving his star full rein.Michel Gondry directs and while there\\'s little of his usual surreal flair there are moments when he puts his mark on the explosive mayhem, giving it the style of a live-action Looney Toons cartoon.Rogen looks like he\\'s waiting for the real leading man to turn up. And where exactly are the jokes?Though tonally uneven, Hornet nonetheless works as breezy, irreverent entertainment that makes a virtue of its unlikely elements.Hornet is a hilarious and action packed film that is one of the most satisfying action-buddy-comedies ever made.Seth Rogen is the Green Hornet. What else do you need to know?Once you get to the fiends and fights that make a comic book movie really work, things go stale.Green Hornet\" works both as an action movie and as a deconstruction of an action movie.There might be a funny movie in a story about a crime fighter who\\'s in it only for the publicity, but \"The Green Hornet\" isn\\'t it.Rogen seems to want to convince the world that a big dumb stoner can be successful, because, hey, what the heck, it worked for him, but Britt Reid/The Green Hornet doesn\\'t have that redemption and growth. Quite a bit less than the sum of its appealing parts.There\\'s simply no center here, no sense that someone is guiding the ship.A better, stranger movie can be glimpsed straining to be noticed behind Rogen\\'s standard goofery.Witless, charmless, clumsy and appallingly unenjoyable, The Green Hornet is almost unrecognizable as having come from the same, endlessly inventive storehouse of creativity as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Rogen\\'s Reid doesn\\'t become a crime fighter for an altruistic reasons: He does it as a lark because he thinks it will be fun. Rogen\\'s Hornet is basically the comic relief. And that is what throws the movie a-kilter.Dear Fat Seth Rogen, I miss you. A long, snarky, borderline disdainful parody that\\'s also an inferior imitation of the movies it mocks. No, thank you.There\\'s so little at stake here that nothing much matters except for a good time.All buzz, no sting.The picture has no reason to exist, yet exist it does, thus between movies that might be good and movies that might be exciting, it fills this unenviable slot as neither.This appears to be a breakout role for the talented and charismatic Chou, whose star should rise in Hollywood. The movie is full of visual eye candy that includes use of a split screen and rapid editing to speed up the car chases and...There\\'s nothing here but a concept and a marketing and merchandising strategy, at the center of which somebody - oh, no - had to come up with an actual movie.While on its own lowbrow terms the movie may work well enough, \\'Kick-Ass\\' outpoints this \\'Smart-Ass\\' cousin by a wide margin.The film is a bit uneven at times, but when it\\'s firing on all cylinders, The Green Hornet is far too entertaining not to enjoy. Even as a mindless diversion, it\\'s weak.Rogen may have lost weight for this role, but it hardly matters-he\\'s still doing a more charming version of Butt-Head, aged twentysomething. You know by now if that works for you or not.While the package as a whole never truly strikes a consistent tone, the boundless energy, surprisingly irreverent dialogue, and creative action sequences carry the day.This morning, the unconscious bodies of three pickpockets were found in front of the Post\\'s offices. Safety-pinned to one was an envelope containing the following movie review.The Green Hornet\" has enough kicks and verve to keep the winter blues at bay, at least for a little while.Is Gondry aware that he\\'s making a film about both white male privilege and sexual harassment in the workplace?While it may not ultimately prove memorable enough to launch a new film franchise, The Green Hornet is still a fun action-comedy and clever superhero satire that\\'s about as close to a cool summer movie as you\\'re going to get in the dead of winter.Almost everything about the film is disappointing.A joy ride of a film that evades the self-consciousness that stalls so many other recent comic-book adaptations, it is one of the best superhero movies ever.Gondry\\'s \"Green Hornet\" does not have a serious bone in his body. Its goal is to satirize superhero motifs - mainly, the idea of the ethnic sidekick.There are some nifty things in between the lulls...in this hodge-podge of creativity, this kinky mess, there is unbridled zest and an almost innocent sense of joyThe movie these guys have come up with is fresh, funny and a bewildering surprise.While it sports a few spare parts that don\\'t quite click, this souped-up superhero vehicle runs smoothly enough thanks to a savvy sense of humor and the charisma of its central crime-fighting duo.You\\'d expect Gondry\\'s version of a superhero movie to be either brilliantly creative or spectacularly misguided, and it\\'s neither; just sporadically funny but more often plodding.Hard to think of a more mystifying mismatch of filmmaker and material.It\\'s a strange, shapeless, rarely satisfying, but generally amiable movie in which everyone appears to be faking it as they go along, and almost -- almost -- getting away with it.Rogen isn\\'t the obvious choice for a comic book icon but he forces his personality onto this material with an ingratiating ease.Brings together almost a dream team of elements which add up to only a very small fraction of the sum of their parts. The movie\\'s just a huge mess. By the time The Green Hornet collapses into a mess of hackneyed car chases and flying glass and bullets, it feels less like the promised irreverent take on the superhero genre, and more like the latest iteration of the Rush Hour movies. The movie lopes along from one half-baked scene to the next, interrupted on occasion by car-porn sequences involving the hero\\'s luminous limo the Black Beauty.What happens when smart people set out to make a dumb movie. They made the movie they wanted to watch, rather than the one anyone else might want to.Pointless goof of a film, can\\'t decide if it wants to be a superhero movie or a parody of one.[A]n aggressively goofy spoof of the modern dark, grim vigilante drama... with as much cartoonish, chaotic energy it can muster... and more than a little meta cunning, too.The choice of Seth Rogen to topline this crimebusting bromedy proves an unlikely but ultimately shrewd one, plugging the void at the heart of the character with an outsize comic persona.Good buddy-buddy chemistry between Chou and Rogan, along with some inspired carnage in the last half hour make THE GREEN HORNET a rare treat in a traditionally slow month.A too-clever-by-half attempt to both satirize and celebrate the superhero genre.The writer who first conceived of The Green Hornet was, in fact, paving the way for the martial arts hero. This film has done the opposite.Rogen tests the limits of his likeability as the spoilt brat who inherits an empire while Gondry scrabbles for the right tone.Everything before this has been crap\", says Rogen during the explosive finale. Many will agree.Gondry\\'s film does have its goofy charms, even though it never quite decides what kind of movie it wants to be.Not an abject failure, but still, not a film that recognizes its own strengths. At its best, it aspires to two dimensions. Three dimensions is far beyond its grasp.Too much. Too numbing. Too coy. And ultimately too violent.An inventive anti-hero theme sets this film apart from the usual superhero movie, but excessive violence and incoherent action leave it deeply frustrating to watch.Enjoyable, frequently funny and occasionally subversive comedy with a strong script, likeable performances and some impressively directed action sequences, though it does drag a bit towards the end.The Green Hornet\" is an almost unendurable demonstration of a movie with nothing to be about.a very successful balance between Rogen\\'s sort of irreverent, off-the-cuff humor and Gondry\\'s limitless, carefully-planned creativityYou know, superhero comedy is tricky. They can\\'t all be Blankman.The latest Hornet, perhaps the most radical makeover of all, is more slapstick than sting and less masquerading noir crime fighter than deluded cartoonish geek avenger, while seemingly referencing both Tarantino\\'s comedy of cruelty and Tom and Jerry. However long and honourable its pedigree, goes in one brain synapse and out the other...Touted as a disaster even before its release, its off-beat tale, visual styling and casting proves that the franchise has more than a little sting left in its tail.I\\'m beginning to suspect that writer-producer-actor Seth Rogen is up to foul play.Rogen\\'s tongue-in-cheek take on a superhero is the film\\'s best -- maybe only -- winning feature, but he makes this low-expectations film more entertaning than you might think. As much a comedy as it is an action movie, actually it\\'s better than that, it\\'s one of the all too rare modern movies which manages to be both. The story falls apart, while Gondry ratchets up the silly action so far over the top the structure of the film can\\'t support it.If unmodulated decibel level and childish, dorkish energy alone could lower a city\\'s crime rate, then consider the cartoon bad guys of cartoon Los Angeles flattened.Rogen\\'s image and his attitude as co-screenwriter of The Green Hornet updates the bland superhero template using comic irreverence.The Green Hornet\\'s only victory is that it isn\\'t flat awful.The interplay between the Green Hornet and straight man Kato delights, overshadowing Cameron Diaz as a mutual love interest.While this latest Rogen-penned iteration is a game try, it feels a bit like he\\'s trying to make a volume out of a footnote.Rogen is just playing a version of the good-natured, wisecracking slacker he plays in everything, which never feels like a comfortable fit alongside the coolly efficient Chou.The Green Hornet is a disjointed jumble of gag laughs, goofy stunts, and bizzare casting.High hopes of magic from the Gondry-Rogen pairing are dashed. Some neat touches aside, this isn\\'t so much eternal sunshine, more superbad.Casting [Seth] Rogen as a crimefighting hero may sound dubious, until you see how the film understands and embraces the disconnect.The Green Hornet provides a half-hour\\'s worth of mildly entertaining travesty before collapsing in a clamor of bombastic action sequences and lame wisecracks.Despite some entertaining moments, this long-in-gestation crime-fighter feature never reaches top speed.This Hornet is a big, boisterous action-comedy - a funny, exciting and intentionally goofy summer movie that just happens to arrive in the middle of January.Words that I never thought I\\'d type, but must after viewing Seth Rogen\\'s take on The Green Hornet: I miss Van Williams. Floats like a butterfly, stings like a gnat.Chou [is] charismatic when his feet and fists are flying but far from nimble when he opens his mouth ... which knocks the film\\'s would-be buddy-comedy bromance on the head.Gondry\\'s contributions to the film amount to little more than rainbow sprinkles atop a very vanilla piece of cinema.[Gondry] has done a stellar job of putting his wacky auteurial stamp on a comedy which is only semi-coherent but still very funny and impeccably fashioned.The Green Hornet is the usual numbing, postmodern pastiche -- which is ironic, since the premise is supposed to be retro, a throwback to a simpler, less synthetic analog age done in digital style.A superhero movie with the soul of a bromance, The Green Hornet is consistently mildly amusing but never quite as fun as it should be. Injecting a devil-may-care attitude into a franchise-focused blockbuster only gets you so far. When all is said and done, this wasp\\'s got no sting.The film is a blast.A surprisingly funny and ingeniously clever take on superheroes ... The Green Hornet certainly sets the bar high for other superhero movies coming out this year.Not as bad as its release date implies nor as good as its creative team suggests.The story is ridiculous and not every plot point makes sense, but if you\\'re willing to turn your brain off and abandon any second thinking, the entertainment value is high.It is confident, sly, silly, thrilling, and a nice tribute to the genre and the character both.A great evening\\'s entertainment when you want to switch off and dip your head in some popcorn.nan'"

       "'the movie is great  it is interesting without being heavy  smart without being pretentious and entertaining without being solicitous it doesn t matter how much of the story is true because the film is the real deal david o  russell follows the fighter and silver linings playbook with the third entry in his  reinvention  trilogy  a film which is getting as much gold and silver on the mantelpiece this award season as his previous two  but less deservedly so the movie and most of its characters too often feel like caricatures  their energy pilfered from superior movies you ve seen before as cons within cons press loyalties on every side  the film is less about political corruption than the deep longing of its characters to find a piece of solid ground  something they can stake a life on it busies itself with a rollicking soundtrack  sexy costumes  and increasingly implausible romantic encounters between the film s principals american hustle amuses with irony  music and wit  it tantalizes with danger but doesn t get violent  its sexiness   there s grinding in washrooms  on tables and laps   is electric and fun  it s enjoyable and fun to watch  but just barely touches the surface of its own narrative it s a sly film that slips through your fingers  leaving the glitter of great performances  but one you ll be hustling to watch again  american hustle slides with such grace through its intrigues  slipping in so many diverting props and devices and walk ons that you may start to feel you re being hustled by the film itself     american hustle has its flaws  major and minor  but it s very entertaining and contains some great performances  especially by the female cast members one of the many pleasures of david o  russell s american hustle  a fizzy late seventies cocktail of comedy  romance  and caper pic  is that bale finally seems to be having a ball american hustle is about life as a performance  the ways in which we perceive ourselves and wish to be perceived by others if only this set of memorable characters were serving a story that didn t feel half rate a movie as smart as  american hustle  knows that those tactile pleasures only matter if they re attached to some kind of emotional resonance if american hustle has anything real to say  it s some minor bromide about greed and corruption  ultimately  like its central characters  it s is all about  tude  of that  it s got a ton there s not a lot of takeaway from american hustle  but that s russell s personality he s got a great appetite for verve and foolhardy spectacle  rather than reverb and real life substance full of agreeable performances and a few  aha  moments that most filmmakers would kill for  but it never comes together in any meaningful way vaults heedlessly between bedraggled comedy and serious stakes scenes in which the director shuts off the fun pure  raw energy david o  russell has made an amazing film here  filled with some of the most complicated  well developed  and fascinating characters to grace the screen this year it s confusing in tone  though very funny at times  especially coming from cooper and lawrence  but by the end  russell feels he s warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he s done anything but  an entertaining but bloated  starry  grand hotel sized con artist caper that looks  sounds and feels like scorsese without a smidgen of the electricity he effortlessly brings to his pictures the movie s greatest strength  is  russell s magnanimity toward his characters  an equable  never cloying embrace of their imperfections david o  russell has a gift for the farce at work in american institutions  and in american hustle he s created another instant classic david o russell s film fizzes with energy and wit  bowling along with a brio that matches the quick wit and razzle dazzle of its con artists amy adams is spectacular  febrile  dramatic  comic  sharp  sarcastic and magnificent to look upon  especially her soaring laughter in an explosive comic sexual scene set in a nightclub ladies  room stall  to call the end result an absolute triumph would undercut more apropos labels  it seeks to be one of the best films of the year  and transcends that goal like the abscam con  the film is a convincing confection  so well played that we don t care if it s the real deal or not look  i think this is a fabulous film  one of the films of the year for me a fun  energetic caper that tries hard to make you love its characters  but mostly fails to succeed  what could have been a trifling little caper movie becomes  in the hands of russell and his superb cast  a rich  character driven film of humor  drama and surprising warmth russell s world view is essentially optimistic and romanticspearheaded by enormously charismatic actors and a script s verbal wit that overrides its untidiness save your admiration for the performances  especially lawrence  who is now hollywood s most important presence in front of the camera it turns out that comb overs  cleavage  cocaine and kookiness are an unbeatable combo  american hustle  is smart  sophisticated and slick  director david o  russell has been nominated for the academy award for both last year s  silver linings playbook  and  the fighter   and he s bound to earn at least a nod again this year to understand the breadth of disco era deception laid out in american hustle  understand that the most honest character in the movie is a politician  not entirely honorable but compared with the swindle sharks circling  he s jimmy carter on sundays grand performances move  hustlefun  charming  but slight   and way too long and flabby in the girth for such slightness a tour de force piece of filmmaking about the art of survival   and a cinematically glorious throwback to the gene hackman era are we being played  oh  yeah  just because the time and place of a film takes place within personal experience doesn t mean it s not a historical epic this is one you ll want to hustle to see on the big screen american hustle doesn t conform to one genre  though it has elements of farce  screwball  heist thriller and caper comedy  in dressing it up like a scorsese style crime movie  russell brings an unusual weight and tension to  the film  russell  writer eric singer  and the hyperventilating cast keep us guessing well into the second half casting christian bale as a bronx jew makes as much sense as casting woody allen as a baptist minister from alabama  not that casting woody allen in bale s role would have saved this mess of a film though never boring  american hustle does itself feel a little like a con   a skilled exercise in creative misdirection russell opts for chaos over clarity and love over workmore successful than any of the cons on screen is the con hustle plays on its audience is there a better actress currently working in movies today than amy adams the actors act up a storm and the tacky period detail  from hideous sofas to men in curlers  fills the screen  but in the end it all feels too staged  too played  too self aware to fully work  a complicated fbi sting operation is combined with not one  but two love triangles in this sharp  witty comedy drama topped by an audacious ending  the writing crackles with authentic sounding dialog and the acting is superb the script by eric singer and david o  russell is rife with banalities and ludicrous situations  mostly involving the mafia  american hustle  is marginally entertaining  and ultimately not a satisfying movie going experience  believe it or not  amidst all of the oversized collars and outlandish suits   russell  wrings pathos out of  his characters  american hustle ultimately establishes itself as yet another disappointment from david o  russell   an incongruous jumble  american hustle s supporting cast and lawrence s stellar turn lingers in the eye  not the movie as a whole  for a film that perhaps attempted to break a mold  it suffers from simply not knowing what it wanted to be abscam comes alive in this stereotype drenched  pratfall ridden but entertaining story of good people lost in the american promise if david o  russell s earlier movies sometimes felt like an attempt to create layered  kid a style concept albums  american hustle feels more like him onstage at the silverdome  banging out the loudest open chord he can and hip thrusting at the audience for a good time  come see this adorable  sexy  deviously antic piece of cockeyed comedy  you want nominations american hustle isn t a bad film    but it s certainly an overrated one a story that spins out of control and lacks a comedic focus a carnival of a film with cons  cleavage and the great christian bale you forget that russell once made such impenetrable navel gazing twaddle as i heart huckabees  and simply revel in the fact that american hustle is often deliriously good fun it sucks you into its alluring story as if you were a mark deliriously alive on screen  with an energy that s often electrifying  it s a movie that in its best moments recalls scorsese s gangster classic goodfellas  with a bit of paul thomas anderson s boogie nights thrown in to sweeten the pot     pay your money and take the ride     laugh and     be strangely moved by the odd looking creatures russell has assembled for his latest ensemble play fun ride from russell  if the opening scene of a film marks the first move of a grand seduction  david o  russell scores a home run in the first five minutes of american hustle beautifully  inventively constructed  and filled with rich performances that are perfectly calibrated to the offbeat tone  director david o   russell was going for the best ensemble performance of the year and it s all true  sort of  perhaps most astonishing of all is that in a film filled such terrific performances  the prevailing personality is that of david o  russell it is a superbly written movie     featuring terrific characters who are played by one of the most talented casts of the year regardless of its fine cast and stylish execution  the shallow  american hustle  sells sparkle and hustle  american hustle offers a  crowd pleasing experience   one with profound social commentary  laugh out loud comedy  and even unexpected moments of compassion to boot the most exciting thing about david o  russell s operatic comedy american hustle is how every piece of it double plays us  the ensemble helps to spotlight virtues in those who are flawed  and flaws in those who are virtuous  earning sympathy where sometimes none is deserved on paper  american hustle should be the movie of the year and sweep the oscars  but its supreme promise fades once the lights go down in the theater  it s good  not great despite its drawbacks   american hustle  does have a rough edged charm that holds your attention the best scorsese film directed by david o  russell it s all hip  humorous  sad  edgy and immensely entertaining  this sprawling period parable about a group of greedy people who aren t who they purport themselves to be if you re looking for a clockwork perfect crime plot  you won t find it here  but if you want to hang with some wildly unpredictable and complex characters and wonder who will come up on top   hustle  is a lot of fun somewhat in keeping with its narrative s spectacle of deception  the comedown of this sugar rush of a film might not reveal the most nutritious consumption  but sometimes the messiest concoctions have a better taste not since goodfellas has america s dark  criminal underbelly been explored with such verve american hustle reminds me of a great scorsese movie  the performances are wonderful and so is the film  but it is not easily categorised  thriller  caper  comedy  romance  period piece  it is all of these and more ambitious even as it studies  exploits and explodes ambition   american hustle  is as good as any american film this year  it s also a lot of fun  don t miss it american hustle is a movie built on that cornerstone of the american dream  reinvention  if you re not happy with who you are  or who people think you are  then go ahead and become somebody else  anything to survive   and thrive don t get distracted by all the quick talking  double crosses or backstabbing  just enjoy some of today s most talented masters of their craft doing what they do best in a film that will leave you feeling anything but ripped off once it s over so many layers of double cross  lies  betrayal  grandiosity  and sheer insanity that the audience may feel they are getting lost  but in a way  that is the point  bursting with humor  great acting and david o  russell s abundant filmmaking talent  american hustle is a joy to watch every time i want to call american hustle s bluff  it rises to being more than the sum of some of its parts  thanks to the female performances this isn t a history lesson  it s pure entertainment  an excuse for good actors to romp through a twisting  well told tale the source of this movie s galvanizing intrigue is that the characters remain in play    they never settle into placeit s one of the year s cleverest films  and also one of the best there is fun to be had  just don t expect something on a level with the director s recent work it joins the pantheon of great con job movies with the sting  house of games and wild things a sloppy  miscast  hammed up  overlong  overloud story that still sends you out of the theater on a cloud of rapture american hustle  may have taken its inspiration from the art of the steal  but it has a heart of pure  if slightly tarnished  gold russell s films find their heroes among the men and women who respond with grace and conscience to what the jennifer lawrence character calls  poisonous choices    american hustle  is what might result if a movie snorted cocaine american hustle may be the finest example of how well the russell formula works  surpassing silver linings playbook and the fighter  his two most recent oscar nominated films with a solid gold cast and a sterling script   american hustle  has a higher return on investment than any other movie in the marketplace  russell  seems to be having obscene amounts of fun  which becomes contagious very quickly american hustle is a reminder that it s a privilege to see work that s so masterful filled with rich characters and sharp dialogue  the movie turns on questions of friendship and fidelity  both personal and political  with a knockout performance by jennifer lawrence as the con man s jealous  ball busting wife  the screenplay is so dense and nuanced  the characters so textured and conflicted  the plot so tight and twisty that american hustle achieves a dramatic reality of documentary proportions david o  russell has created this riveting world full of eccentric  well rounded characters  american hustle is a crime drama that is constantly engaging  hilarious  and stimulating  christian bale is sleazy perfection  some critics love to tear down a crowd pleasing contender  don t let them sway you  american hustle is a good time holiday movie brilliantly directed and superbly written  this is a hugely entertaining drama with impeccable production design work  a fabulous soundtrack and note perfect performances from a terrific ensemble cast above everything else  russell has an unerring talent for drawing out the best from his actors  everyone here is in top form  though  bradley  cooper s near manic fbi agent dictates some odd acting choices though the maneuvering almost descends into tedium at times  russell has created a dense and operatic portrait in which nothing is as it seems many of the plot set ups get plenty of laughs  but the movie feels like a series of contrivances to borrow a phrase the film s con artists are prone to saying  american hustle works from the feet up  and the fun is intoxicating betrays a lack of cinematic judgment that s frankly astonishing  from a group of very accomplished filmmakers and performers  it s scorsese karaoke  think  casino  meets  the grifters   shot through with a hefty dose of the off kilter     and that s  american hustle  russell s unerring ability to take the careworn components of a story and fashion them into something unique and poignant reaches its peak with an exuberant caper that satisfies across the board   from love story to switch backing crime yarn it s an experiment in character exploration  you ll walk away from it with an affirmation that people are complicated bundles of contradictions  especially these people being swindled has never been this much fun russell s aping is still a knockout  with enough razzle dazzle style and propulsive humor to make it one of the most casually fun movies of the year american hustle is a very well acted tale of con artists and their volatile relationships an example of performances transcending the motion picture they are in   american hustle  excels when observing its human figures in all of their honest and pretend forms russell  following last year s sweet  the silver linings playbook  with a very different tale of reinvention  has made a glittery disco ball of a movie  with lawrence as its unexpectedly shining star american hustle confidently tackles this concept of transcending reality through deception  showcasing the versatility of its exceptional cast amidst a tale peppered with savage laughs and dark twists a bizarrely still  tortured caper  the feature offers exceptional performances and a coarse script  yet attention always manages to return to its visual impression  calling up the decade in the strangest ways  american hustle  is a good film that could have been great had it not gone into hibernation through its middle portion  however  thanks to one of the year s best ensembles and russell s keen eye for direction it becomes an enjoyable romp american hustle is a big  bold  and brash study of big  bold  and brash characters russell has always had a talent for harmonizing tragedy and comedy  seriousness and outlandishness  all within a precise tone that allows for a wide range of emotions and effects  but his hand has never been more sure fast and loose but it could be fast and looser  through voice over  withheld info  shaggy dog stories and flywheel spinning actor s exercises  russell keeps yanking the plot back like a balloon salesman grabbing fleeing merchandise      russell  bullshits his way through the narrative  basically  giving his stellar cast plenty of room to improvise at length but in the end coming off as an indulgent storyteller unable to self edit there s a self aware feel to the period pageantry  the alternatingly seductive and kinetic cinematography  and the actor s showcase this ramshackle contraption has been held together with spit and bailing wire to be keeps you guessing throughout  a very well written piece and yet another oscar contender russell s principal obsession is the period and  i m sorry  but someone really should ve taken the filmmaker aside before shooting began and reminded him the decade s been done to death  maybe ron burgundy could ve broken the news it s hilarious and sad and  especially  entertaining i wouldn t call american hustle my kind of movie  but perversely  i have to admit i enjoyed it  primarily because of the twisted logic and wicked cleverness a profoundly entertaining collection of none too bright folks who think they re smarter than everyone else  and it s all set to the best soundtrack of the year likeable and engaging despite its overly long running time  sloppy screenplay and rambling structure the movie is an undeniable good time  but don t expect any of it to hold together as with previous films the fighter and silver linings playbook  david o russell can expect to bother the prize givers this award season with american hustle the best time i ve had at the movies all year the film zigs and zags  chasing after many different characters  and that sprawl  the rogue s gallery of strays  cheaters and deceivers  activates the film rather than deflates it jennifer lawrence is entirely extraordinary  improving on the performance that won her an oscar for russell s last film  long may this collaboration continue director and co writer david o  russell deserves all the credit in the world for creating a story  characters and environment in which his actors could truly get lost it s a process  it s a thrill  a way to survive and to trust  to make good even when the choices are bad a great deal more fun than most oscar hopefuls allow themselves to be  think goodfellas  but with bad comb overs  and perms  and yards of corduroy and crushed velour  american hustle is a relative of goodfellas and boogie nights  although never quite as transcendently magical as those two films  which just means it isn t one of the greatest movies ever made  so don t hold that against it you may not trust the facts in american hustle but you can rely on it as one of this year s most aggressively entertaining films an extremely entertaining  brilliantly acted  highly diverting film which   like all hustles   delivers less than it promises  still  it s worth being taken for the ride one of the very best films of the year a well made film that left me emotionally cold american hustle is saturday night bluster american hustle is an ambitious satire  made by an accomplished filmmaker and loaded with terrific acting talent  but despite appreciating it for what it tried to achieve instead  it s hard not to feel slightly conned deliriously entertaining and sexy credit the script and the editing as well  but american hustle is quite simply an actor s movie  and the entire ensemble is just fun to watch in a year already graced with a glorious over supply of great films  american hustle arguably contains the best performance package of the lot on the plus side of the ledger  russell enables his cast to inhabit some colorful  downright transformative  characters it s rarely as playful or funny or loose or hip as it hopes a slick  funny and hugely entertaining film anchored by a genuine emotional centre out scorseses scorsese with its epic ensemble historical crime dramedy bursting with insanely engaging characters who are impossibly real and impossibly ridiculous whose stories you don t ever want to end david o  russell picked the right cast  but the wrong genre  for a sincere meditation on insincerity even with a freewheeling style   hustle  is never aimless  all that flash  sass and canny sense for detail hit the jackpot    the actors give the movie different sorts of mania it s a messy movie  yes  but that complements the messy personalities at its center mesmerizing mature drama with just a bit of sex  violence american hustle may be full of people faking  but russell is the real deal loose  wandering  and often monotonous it s a kaleidoscopic carnival  structured from the viewpoint of each of its main protagonists  the film itself is devised a species of scam  and for a while it s fun to be in on the con  russell is  in effect  playing us    the emphasis is on comedy and lightness highlighted by award quality performance  especially by lawrence and adams  who appears in extremely revealing clothes throughout an awkward start  especially as it takes a moment to get used to russell s style and tone  but once  hustle  finds its footing it really takes off and is one of the most intelligent and enjoyable films of the year despite all this copycatting  the movie still has an interesting energy russell is so enamored with the period pizzazz   the outrageous hairstyles and outfits  the strobe lit clubs  the yellows and browns   that the movie flatlines with a tighter plot and more consistent tone  american hustle could have had a shot at greatness all in all   american hustle  is a fun ride   while it lasts ridiculously entertaining in all the best ways an acting masterclass delivered by some of hollywood s best  dizzying  outlandishly entertaining    isn t it a pleasure to get hustled by such exquisite professionals     american hustle is like a passionate  booze soaked conversation at a party  fun while it last  but foggy the next morning immensely entertaining  impeccably structured and featuring excellent performances from its entire cast  american hustle is one of the year s absolute best films and a serious contender for every major award high energy comedy comes naturally to the filmmaker  he exults in free association  emotional riffs  in the craziness that underlies ostensibly rational behavior with one of the best ensemble casts of any film this year  it s audacious  enthralling and uproarious this year s argo in that it s a smart  adult caper that has the potential to both score major awards and major box office  it s a blast from start to finish  it truly is a good movie that will get the audience sucked in  however the tone that david o  russell has been able to inject into his films takes surprisingly long to surface here russell has created another film that is a joy to watch from beginning to end  he uses his considerable talent stockpile in front of the camera to weave a story that is funny  dramatic  and laughs at itself all at once  a dark comedy with a dash of crime drama and a crime drama with a healthy sense of humor  american hustle defies easy categorization as it offers up a twisty plot and some of the year s best performances for some  the silver linings in russell s movies represent a failure to embrace darkness  i see them as a humanist s act of resistance  that s why american hustle ranks with the year s best movies  it gets under your skin the film has a sort of disciplined looseness to it  tightly paced and shrewdly constructed but also ridiculously entertaining it s a film of jaw dropping virtuosity and pleasure  one that leaves you revved  enthralled  tickled  moved  and amazed american hustle  giddily embraces the excesses of its era  from spandex to  staches  though it s a farce that speaks as well to this tarnished age    so eager to sell the sizzle that the lack of a steak barely registers it s a high spirited lark that works thanks to russell s dazzling direction  delicious period details and a parade of stellar performances with a crackling script and masterful direction  russell has made a fiction that is stranger    and way more fun    than the truth  he has the help of a dream cast of actors  all at the top of their games this is a film to be enjoyed for its eccentric performances  a hyper  engrossing dramedy of relationships in a dazzling movie about the art of the con  jennifer lawrence    playing a feisty and frustrated new york housewife    manages to steal all her scenes  david o  russell deploys his deranged genius to explore the real events behind abscam  cleverly focussing on the inter relationships rather than the details of the elaborate sting operation american hustle turns out to be a freewheeling party of a movie  one that never stops adding complications and wrinkles and hungry new players to the mix  david o   russell is not scorsese  he doesn t do  cool shots  with the camera  his passion is for observing actors  giving them the space to create chaos that his frames struggle to contain just because david o  russell s take on abscam isn t what i d hoped it would be doesn t mean it isn t still a damn entertaining movie  in fact  i had a blast watching it director david o  russell delivers once again with this wonderfully performed  wildly entertaining dissection of the american dream david o  russell enters marty scorsese territory with the sagacious wit of mark twain and satire and slapstick worthy of preston sturgesamerican hustle is an extremely entertaining ride through the human condition  with characters just short of ridiculous  the beautiful thing is that russell does this without becoming mean american hustle offers so many easy pleasures that people may not think of it as a work of art  but it is  in the world that russell has created  if you don t come to play you re not fully alive another vibrant film directed by david o  russell that is bursting with colorful characters  funny scenes  and standout performances  it is a wildly entertaining piece of work that features one of the best ensembles of the year  never quite lets you forget you re watching bravura acting but that acting is deliriously funny  the film is just enough over the top so the artifice becomes part of the joke does american hustle have heart    does it have importance  such naive questions  it has jennifer lawrence blowing up a microwave lying is an ugly  grubby business  which is why hair maintenance amongst con artists is so important a velvet drenched romp through the world of a con man but most of the time it s like watching a las vegas martin scorsese tribute showit s a little bit  boogie nights   a little bit  argo   a little bit  goodfellas   it s a breath mint  it s a chewing gum  it s a laxative  it s a hockey puck american hustle contains fireworks aplenty dramatic outbursts of bravura filmmaking  sly acting choices  a scene that makes robert de niro scary again but also a few too many familiar moments david o  russell has crafted an unexpectedly zany  tantalizing crowd pleaser that s relentlessly entertaining with a stacked cast  and sharp scripting and direction from russell  american hustle makes for a highly entertaining guide on how to fake it in americathis film has actual heart and soul  that s because russell looks at the whys of these people s lives in ways that make this movie jump to life at unexpected moments the film may lack grit but the stellar cast adds to its allure  helping to round out this dynamic account where reinvention offers the means to endure a feast of a movie an uncorked entertainment in which every scene trembles with energy and actorly invention a deliciously entertaining movie about the perfect con  corruption and how to survive on thin ice  american hustle starts its hustling right from the get go with its edgy script  winning cast and fab jazzy scorefunny  sexy and stylish as hell  russell s scorsese homage lacks the zip of marty s greatest work  but makes up for it with hilarious dialogue and a killer ensemble on top form martin scorsese has his goodfellas  david o  russell answers with his mediocre fellas  while russell s film succeeds on the strength of its casting and characters  it s dragged down by a murky and poorly paced narrative you feel that one false move from anyone could bring the whole thing crashing down to earth  fortunately  russell s cast seem to have an innate sense of exactly how far they can push it    doesn t amount to much  but wow does it have some electric performances a zany comedy that makes fbi agents look like keystone cops russell distils his own toxic kind of nitrous oxide and pipes it into the cinema russell and co writer eric singer have used the general details of the events to whip up a truly hilarious look at a bunch of dreamers and con artists all lying each other into a lather  and it s a raucous entertainment while you have to admire american hustle for its willingness to work hard and play harder  it s also hard to not notice that all of its frantic efforts don t really go anywhere new one of those extremely watchable movies that will suck you into a cable tractor beam when you come across it for the next ten yearsif awards were handed out for the sloppiest movies   american hustle  would be a dead ringer for just such a booby prize  a brilliant cast shines in david o  russell s deliriously funny account of the notorious abscam case an infectious blast of funky jazz played by a terrific cast and a director at the top of their respective games has the kind of throbbing pulse  wicked snap and sheer moviemaking bravado that makes it one of a very few films that can be mentioned in the same breath as goodfellas russell turns the pursuit of the american dream into the ultimate escapism david o  russell s american hustle is at times both deliciously sexy and hilariously unsexy in its attempt to portray the awful  scheming hustlers we all pretend not to be the movie is a mess  but a glorious  big hearted  beautifully acted one silver linings playbook may well be my favourite movie of the year  go see it  like  right now cooper manages to show that he is still capable of doing more than his traditional throw away  comedic roles although the story sometimes drags and the predictable rom com ending feels too pat   silver linings playbook  scores some intriguing insights into what mental illnesses we consider socially acceptable thanks to some truly terrific acting and amusing subplots with pat s parents  the story works  playing outspoken  emotionally damaged young widow tiffany  lawrence is a firecracker  a powder keg  a force of nature silver linings playbook is difficult to like  and too long  with a climactic dance scene that is filmically botched  which is fine with the movie because according to the plot it did not have to be good to succeed russell s smart  snappy script is delivered by a top notch cast  including two thoroughly likeable and well matched leads despite the film s flaws  russell excels at creating a community of misfits around pat and tiffany once silver linings playbook gets close to lawrence  it doesn t have to crowd her again   she holds up her head  breathes hard and glows silver linings playbook gives us four performers to relish it s a challenging picture  but it runs the gamut of emotions so well that it s nearly impossible to dislike wouldn t it be great if mental illness really was as adorable as it is in the movies silver linings playbook  makes comic hay from bipolar illness  early death  sexual adventurism  self improvement binges  football fanaticism  degenerate gambling and father son estrangement  as one would expect from latter day russell movies but silver linings playbook never induces a roll of the eyes  even if it never really surprises in an age when the concept of comedies about possible kinships between characters is dominated by sugary devices and contrivance  here at last is a movie about real situations  real people and the natural experiences that evolve from them a unique dramedy that stands heads and shoulders above most romantic films a wild mess  but what a mess it is it finds the gentle balance between traditional romantic comedy and artistic exploration of the laws of attraction a romantic comedy for people who don t like what hollywood has been calling  romantic comedies  these days  one of the most pleasurably offbeat experiences since the philadelphia eagles last enjoyed a winning season  a deft treatment of its delicate subject material and some remarkable performances that give the film both touching  raw  authentic emotion and a certain kinetic humor jennifer lawrence is the only aspect of the film that truly lives up to the trumped up awards buzz and hype  but being a perfectly enjoyable light comedy with heaps of heart is no small feat in itself i love the work that deniro and lawrence do here  but ultimately all they do is prove the old adage that you can cover up a lot of problems with the script by hiring good actors  silver linings playbook looks like your run of the mill wacky family comedy  but it s an important film and a great one that deserves to sweep the awards it s nominated for silver linings playbook is defined by the positive decisions that are made in the face of imperfection  desperation  and the desolate wasteland of your world in pieces director david o  russell forms a unique and incredible romance dramedy   there is some charm to the story  but the final act is very neat  predictable  contrived  and not up to originality of the first two  director david o  russell is a little too chipper at times   breaking a restraining order is really no joke   but he brings a breeziness to this likeable tale of two misfits trying to make it work  it may be a hollywood comedy  but it s one that feels beautifully alive on the surface silver linings playbook is a raucous romantic comedy  but its real interests are superstition and delusion a volatile mix of familial drama and madcap comedy  infectious optimism and razor wire wit  it s one of the most purely enjoyable films released in the past twelve months i suppose the phrase  serious romantic comedy  sounds like a paradox  but that s exactly what  silver linings playbook  is  an intelligent  edgy dark comedy with romance at its core  this is a rom com dressed up as an oscar baiting  dramedy   it s a good rom com thanks to it s edge    but occasionally has the bad traits of a bad rom com silver linings playbook puts the  fun  in  dysfunction   and sure  that sounds glib  but actually  it s a rather extraordinary achievement  especially when you re skirting on the edges of sanity  a bittersweet pill that s a mixture of an endearing family drama and modern romance that s an absolute delight  tows the line of conventional  feel good hollywood rom com  albeit dressed up in just enough art house quirk to make it feel like something slightly radicala reminder that  sanity  doesn t make your flaws any more orderly silver linings playbook is a fine  funny film  and one that should charm viewers who haven t been tricked by all those oscar nominations into anticipating it as some kind of world changing work of art for the ages david o  russell s latest buzz film straddles a fine line between farce and kitchen sink drama before settling into a groove that gets under one s skin it starts to fray about halfway through as it shifts into a more conventional mode  taking on the usual trappings of the genre and making its way to a predictable resolutionboth charming and gritty    cooper is edgy  while lawrence is dynamiteif there s one reason why you should see this film  it s to admire the wonderful performances from bradley cooper and jennifer lawrence cooper and lawrence shine in linings down to earth  funnier than you d expect  and sympathetic toward its volatile  damaged characters  just the sheer number of characters flitting around  each scrambling for plot space  gives an idea of just how frantic this movie can be  but russell expertly uses all of it for maximum emotional    and sometimes physical    impact yes  the marketing presents it as a big broad comedy    and it certainly is    but it s also a unique and involving tale of two outsiders who together find a way to get on with life after it has dealt them some bad hands it s tough to go wrong when your movie features two of the hottest stars  but director david o  russell doesn t stop there when lawrence and cooper are together  their chemistry jumps and sparks and their rat a tat psycho banter aims for cary grant and rosalind russell territory a cinematic high wire act that audaciously blends edgy comedy together with genuinely touching drama into one of the most purely and surprisingly entertaining movies of the year director david o  russell  who adapted the novel  and his cast fill the story with engaging  believable characters fine mainstream sitcom material writer director david o  russell keeps the audience guessing  he takes unexpected twists and turns as if defying you to guess what will come next consistently engaging  funny  and touching  this is the kind of picture in which two hours of running time whiz by in a flash succeeds less on the merits of aesthetics than its willingness to give in to crowd pleasing effervescence a quirky  dramatic and totally entertaining movie that features someof the best acting of the year having gone from unknown actress to oscar nominee to  the hunger games  in what seemed like a blink of an eye  lawrence shows herself a master of timing and plays off cooper brilliantly it s a rom com that succeeds in revitalizing that discredited genre where so many others have failed  injecting it with the grit and emotion of realist drama rather than with amped up whimsy or social satire or montages of people walking on the beach silver linings playbook tells us that happily ever after may depend on finding people who coexist with our lunacy  not ones who can lead us out of it  in any case  it s crazy good unique  beguiling  and occasionally frustrating  these descriptions equally apply to silver linings playbook and its two central characters a crazy beaut of a comedy that brims with generosity and manages to circumvent predictability at every turn russell keeps the outcome interesting  he knows that every silver lining has a cloud  the plot is clever and a bit unconventional  bradley cooper  jennifer lawrence and robert de niro all turn in wonderful performances in this very funny  very warm comedy during its rocky road to becoming a fractured love story  silver linings playbook and its great ensemble cast run a funny  conflict mined  even suspenseful path  it s a total winner unlike the usual run of the mill rom com  this film bristles with life from the central core of the love story  to the quirky band of supporting players who add to the fun with  the silver linings playbook   russell picks up the traditional quirky rom com genre and shakes it around  just to see what happens  where it s going is fairly predictable  how it gets there isn t  a delightfully dysfunctional romantic comedy that s moving  funny and features just the right amount of crazy love  a tenderhearted tale about two terribly wounded souls who survive by grudgingly leaning on each other s shoulder  your best bet for a movie that will entertain you  make you laugh and maybe even make you tear up russell handles the shifts in tone extremely effectively  and has sacrificed little of his sardonic edge in crafting something this superficially accessible funny without being glib  serious without being pretentious or depressing  this is a mature movie with fully realized characters and fine performances cooper gives a fine performance in a difficult role  but the one who really shines is lawrence  beautiful and sexy  she should be up for awards for this one  the movie itself is bipolar  full of mounting tension and hilarity like a classic screwball comedy  but it s all just barely skimming above a deep layer of darkness  delivers the kind of sharply timed laughs that sturges and wilder would ve appreciatedthere s a lot to like here and with strong performances all around  a fresh script with characters that sound and act real  add this film to your essential oscar viewing game plan loaded with pleasant surprises  this adaptation of matthew quick s novel combines romantic comedy  dysfunctional family woes and a sense of danger without ever losing its way one hundred percent predictable  yet strangely kind of fun it s honest you see  and honestly  as any fule no  is the bedrock of any successful relationship whether it be between two homo fictives or an audience and their movies    recalls the screwball psychiatry of russell s earlier efforts  only this time the farce has heart  screwball  is a slang term for  crazy   and perhaps this is what inspired writer director david o  russell to literalize as well as update the screwball comedy genre here   when you make a movie set in philly  you d better get it right  knowledgeable eagles  fans may find russell s sense of history maddening writer director david o  russell s out of control filmmaking style is perfectly suited to a romantic comedy involving mental illness  and he infuses the film with a sparky unpredictability that s echoed in the perfectly graded performances of the cast smart  funny  great performancesindeed the movie does make you feel quite good about humanity as the final credits roll    ultimately unable to wholeheartedly become the feel good romantic comedy that russell has clearly intended   offers the satisfaction you d expect from a romcom and feel good sports movie  but lawrence and cooper s delicate treatment of their characters makes it far more than a fleeting source of entertainment silver linings playbook remains a very classy  acceptably funny slice of comic drama  but that eventual cop out feels deeply unsatisfactory easily overcomes its familiar beats  thanks to a real attention to character detail  a nonjudgmental approach to all the flaws plaguing the players  and a cast that works beautifully together laugh out loud funny at times and gut wrenching at others with just the right amount of bleak material to be intriguing and not overly depressing  silver linings playbook is one of the most genuine and human films of the year  h alf thrilling  as it always is when a movie does well something the movies don t typically try to do at all  and half uncomfortable  because it s not always easy to watch love is not perfect  but it beats the next best thingthis is a date movie that caters to the needs of both men and women  american football and comedy  ballroom dancing and romance  silver linings playbook covers all those bases    and rises above them too seeing it a second time has made me love it even more  not always the case a charming  touching and funny film  which sits near the top end of the rom com world there are times when it does something new with the genre   and it does make you care about the protagonists a feelgood film that doesn t avoid life s harsh realities  silver linings playbook is heartwarming winter treat a funny  believable film about the ability of even the damaged and imperfect to earn a little happiness     a terrific ensemble comedy about mental illness that achieves just the right balance of humor and poignancy without trivializing or exploiting the affliction at its center if the fighter  was russell s take on a sports movie  then silver linings playbook is his version of a romantic comedy  and a delightfully twisted one at that silver linings playbook  is a hollywood romantic comedy made to mask the horrific downside of mental illness while still giving the audience a little sense of superiority as they walk out of the cinema silver linings playbook is all things to all moviegoers  please join the queues circling the blocks it should be unwatchable  but in the sure hands of america s most effervescent humanist director  david o  russell  it s unmissable a man s bi polar disorder is supposed to give license to implausible and contrived histrionics  silver linings playbook is always interesting and full of humanity in all its shades  it has plenty of black humour and it s superbly acted might at first look like proper cinema red in tooth and claw  but underneath it s a bundle of matted fleece and bleating a hugely enjoyable  warm hearted romantic comedy drama with a refreshing honesty towards its subject matter and a pair of terrific performances from bradley cooper and jennifer lawrence this is a date movie that doesn t offer the sophistication it thinks it does  but is as enjoyable and good natured as the genre requires certain movies are sprinkled with pixie dust  an indescribable concoction that infuses scenes with irresistible magic  silver linings playbook is practically hand rolled and deep fried in the stuff  silver linings playbook paves a highly entertaining road to recovery for its characters   one you will be glad to have helped sponsor with a truly awkward script and no chemistry between the leads this thanksgiving arrival is a turkey while one respects the film for trying to juggle disparate tones  it never manages to find the proper balance russell crafts a baker act romance playing loose and eccentric with the genre  the banter is spikier  wacky sidekicks have issues  too  and pat and tiffany s obstacles aren t fluff  the screws are tighter  and the movie is a ball an edgy romantic dramedy that suits our anxious times lawrence s bold performance and her fearlessly sexual character are more than russell knows how to harness an intelligent and well crafted film that seeks to inspire audiences by finding the humor amid the prevailing bittersweetness of life  speaking of oscars  the great deniro is great once again here with leads as winning as cooper and lawrence  and russell s signature mix of clever and sincere dialogue  the hook is set this meaningful film keeps the laughs  giddy anxiousness and warm butterflies from the trailer and sustains it all through two full hours of a love story lawrence  in her most high low  sad comic turn yet  is remarkable until the characters can take their needs seriously and laugh at themselves  at least a little  they re not going to be healthy  playbook traces all their journeys from stubborn self assertion to a fragile connectedness that might lead to lasting bonds it shouldn t work   there s just too much going on  but it does  spectacularly  go see it just the sort of rom com you d expect from a director who once came to blows with george clooney just about everybody in the cast of david o  russell s strange and disturbing and deeply romantic new film has the chance to act with a capital a this is a really funny film with some great performances  but sadly the second half shows that russell lost track of what was important in the story  this still balances out to a good movie   but  it could have been great had it stayed on course the film is at once heartfelt and funny  farcical and sincere  and packed with performances that pull off that difficult balancing act  in short  it s a masterpiece there s nothing wrong with the overrated jennifer lawrence that some serious acting lessons couldn t improve  the rest of the actors are pretty much on their own for a movie that seems at times to have no idea what it s trying to do   silver linings playbook  is compulsively watchable unlike typical romantic genre fare  its jagged edges will make the characters and film a challenge for some viewers  which is the reason why others embrace it sharp of tongue  generous of spirit  silver linings playbook is a jagged  loopy romantic comedy about  crazy  people that insists  deep down  we re all a little nuts the silver linings playbook  defies categorization  it s both comedy and drama  without fitting neatly into either genre the film is just as clumsy about psychological issues as hollywood movies generally are  but jennifer lawrence s performance makes all that moot david o  russell s latest entertaining ode to lovable characters you should probably be afraid of  going deep without resorting to trick plays  the sure handed  silver linings playbook  scores on every possession some movies are so likable  so naturally charming  that you ll forgive any dopey idea they throw at you david o  russell has pulled off a tricky feat here  finding just the right tone in crafting a romantic comedy whose sweethearts suffer from bipolar disorder and depression silver linings playbook isn t perfect   the ending is untidy   but it may just be the year s best comedy pretty much a miscalculation from beginning to end silver linings playbook is a rare thing indeed   a romantic comedy that completely delivers on both sides of the equation  a deliriously funny and disarmingly poignant love story that s sure to brighten the outlook of even the hardest cynic a well paced and whip smart screenplay russell s deft writing  and the ensemble cast  keep it light and entertaining  the ending is a bust  but there s a wealth of good stuff here cooper and lawrence have a nice  believable chemistry  and by the time they get to the dance competition it s surprising how tense it is and much you are rooting for them jennifer lawrence is the standout in a tonally uneven  eccentric romantic dramedy that fuses the fisher king with romy and michele s high school reunion tinged with shadows and ignited by lawrence and cooper  silver linings playbook raises the bar on romantic comedy  it s crazy good it s lopsided and spotty  but it s alive in a way that suddenly makes you remember to what degree most hollywood movies aren t unlikely and engaging  this quirky  off beat romantic dramedy is a cheerfully enjoyable crowd pleaser silver linings playbook is cooper and lawrence s show with silver linings playbook  david o  russell has again recalibrated  and achieved the quirky yet poignant balance of his best early work  david o  russell is screwing with us  he s seeing how many indie rom com tropes he can juggle at the same time and still make it work  with one big twist  brad cooper is the manic pixie dream girl with a penis it s smart  edgy  and filled with some of the best performances of the yearoffbeat dramedy mixes light and dark  some intense moments what starts off as a serious examination of mental illness turns into an entirely different movie  one with nearly the exact same third act as  high school musical   contrived  but beautifully cast and very entertaining pat and tiffany s love story may only be possible in the movies  but damned if the actors don t make it seem real it s lawrence who knocked me sideways  i loved her in winter s bone and the hunger games but she s very young   i didn t think she had this kind of deep toned  layered weirdness in her david o  russell returns to his distinctive brand of neurotic screwball comedy  and like his early features spanking the monkey and flirting with disaster  this one somersaults giddily from sanity to insanity to sanity again  consistently funny and  as it builds to its conclusion  also very sweet fun silver linings  feels different and fresh  also sincere it s tiresome to hear reviewers hyping this or that funny movie as  the year s best   so i won t  but you get the idea  silver linings playbook  is fun  sharp and sometimes moving  but it s not reinventing any kind of wheel a determinedly offbeat romance and rather knowing portrait of self destructive behavior like a production of when harry met sally put on by the characters from one flew over the cuckoo s nest  silver linings uses cliches like a straight jacket  containing an otherwise nutty film and making it safe for audiences to approach it might be contrived that way  but we are willing to forgive and accept because the path to what we expect is rewarding  cooper gives his most natural  affecting and compelling performance yet   lawrence makes us forget her dewy youth just minutes into her brittle  biting turn as a woman whose unbalanced rage is even more cleverly concealed   because of lawrence  i just can t write off this movie would that every feel good movie came by its good feelings so honestly silver linings playbook is  like its protagonist  hopelessly optimistic     and it s a sign of the film s potency that we buy into it with our own sense of hopefulness     this is a film with its own cadence  its own particular sense of music  and it is a tremendous success for writer director david o  russell a bittersweet romantic comedy  plain and simple  and  by the time it has added in subplots involving dance competitions and football superstitions  also rather unwieldy it s a strain to care about pat  and it s impossible to believe in his world an unfussy  rambling crowd pleaser that recalls elements of the filmmaker s past work    silver linings is consistently entertaining  with its scrappy  well drawn characters  offbeat humor and indefatigable positive outlook the movie doesn t break any thematic ground  and in other hands this same material might have made for an insufferable katherine heigl vehicle  but russell and his cast make it sing   and soar  too  dramatic  emotional  even heartbreaking  as well as wickedly funny  it has the gift of going its own way  a complete success from a singular talent    that rare thing  a top notch comedy orchestrated by a director with a talent for teasing out the unexpected cooper s performance meets lawrence s  beautifully  halfway everything comes together brilliantly in  silver linings playbook  for the film s crazed but uncrazy lovers  for the filmmaker  david o  russell  and best of all for lucky us no matter how grim it s looking for certain kinds of laughter  as long as there s david o  russell  things will be ok silver linings playbook   the exuberant new movie from david o  russell  does almost everything right silver linings playbook is an infectiously rousing crowd pleaser about psychological damage and emotional healing  which would seem oxymoronic if not for the authentic  insightful atmosphere and marvelous performances anyone seeking proof that a movie can transcend its subject should look to silver linings playbook it s clever and cute and never lets you forget it  winning in spite of how much it insists on it cooper s much better than usual  while the always great lawrence is particularly fantastic i say good for russell for risking a protagonist who requires some patience and forgiveness it s the perfect material for russell  who not only deals perceptively with the dizzying swings of manic depression  but makes it the fabric of a big  generous  happy making ensemble comedy silver linings playbook  is so good  it could almost be a terrific old classic  while the ultimate takeaway from silver linings playbook is  as the title suggests  optimistic  it s not just because the film has two recognizable stars and a cutesy premise a solid cast delivers in a movie that is thoroughly enjoyable if not consistently great it s not often that a movie can affect you and make you laugh out loud all at once  but  silver linings playbook  coordinates the task with ease most of the way  the film s deficiencies are survivable if only for jennifer lawrence and some fleeting moments of emotional clarity and bracing conflict russell pitches the action at a manic  screwball pace  and the cast is more than up to the task  with cooper and lawrence attracting and repelling each other with equal dynamism playbook  walks a tightrope in how it portrays mental illness    deriving humor out of its characters  actions while demonstrating just how deep rooted their problems are a razor sharp  unfiltered exploration of recovery and reconciliation  manic as it might be stylistically  emotionally silver linings playbook maintains too even of a keel david o russell s movie to love raises the bar on what has become the traditional rom com disney s enchantedis a fun homage to all the walt disney animation studios classics director kevin lima s new film enchanted is seemingly made for all the women who grew up on fairytale endings  but growing up is perhaps the wrong word to use  permanently infantilized might be a better term in enchanted  even the vermin whistle while they work in the hands of adams  the evolution elicits as much sympathy as it does laughter  largely because she grounds every pivotal moment in wide eyed kindness and generosity  pushing us to care about her fate after about half an hour the comic steam is dispersed by whimsy  though timothy spall is pretty funny as the evil stepmother s varlet valet delightful stuff this delightfully funny and smart family film certainly lives up to its title  by the time you are reading this  the ads will already be proclaiming that enchanted is  enchanting   and for once they ll be spot on the result is a fresh  feel good crowd pleaser that pokes affectionate fun at fairytale conventions while remaining true to their spirit narrated by julie andrews with marsden gleefully camping it up and adams the personification of winning charm  only a scrooge would deny the film possesses oodles of fun and wit  it s just not as enchanting as it deserves to be sometimes the big studios get it right  enchanted is a high concept fish out of water tale that works on so many levels it s dizzying  plus  it features a breakout performance by the luminous amy adams enchanted is as conventional as the films it tries to satirize amy adams is a star in the making this large scale disney family film is sheer delight there s no big shocker ending in enchanted  and it follows a pretty typical formula  but what makes it a winner is its ability to make you smile anyway  be forewarned  you might even get a cheek ache enchanted is a sweet romantic fable  with some loveable performances and some genuine good humour warm  funny and delightfully nostalgic  this is a must watch this christmas for the whole family amy adams is the reason to see enchanted  the only reason  but she is so good and committed to a role most actress would play with a knowing smirk  that reason is more than enough for the first time  perhaps ever  disney turns the reflecting mirror at itself  allowing for some inspired fun at its own expense like the cinderella figure she plays in disney s enchanted  amy adams spreads a contagion of delight  the movie is great fun  but she s enchanting you get the sense that lima and writer bill kelly barely scratched the surface of possibilities of their clever but largely unexplored gimmick it s the simple charm and humour of the tale that lingers in the memory happily  the leads carry the day  james marsden as a prince of grinning vanity  susan sarandon as the wicked stepmother  and  above all  amy adams  who  in the role of a would be princess  finds true momentum  not just sappiness  in the farce of innocence amy adams announces herself as a viable new commercial leading lady in enchanted  a genial family film which finds animated fairytale characters thrust into the real world enchanted still provides a pleasant twist on walt disney s traditional output and has enough decent performances from its cast to raise titters and smiles from even the most grumpy movie goers enchanted is rich in disney iconography  the best recipient of which is susan sarandon as the wicked queen  the film in general really benefits from a stellar production team that create the feeling of a classic disney film in the real world it pulls out all the stops in hitting all the familiarities of the genre and spins it on its head in both a fun and intelligent way  snobs will hate it because of its happily ever after ending  everyone else will love it for the exact same reason  after all  a little fantasy never hurt anyone it rides on the charm of its actors  particularly amy adams as the hapless  homicidally upbeat princess and james marsden as her would be prince charming disney offers a delightfully affectionate  and surprisingly entertaining  parody of its own traditions as close as you can get to a family friendly  live action satire of disney animation  made all the better since disney itself made the film though the film is full of allusions to the disney canon  they are generally unobtrusive echoes rather than eager satires  this is a children s movie at which adults are also welcome  not a cartoon for grownups it is rare for me to use a term like  magical  to describe a film  but this movie deserves it    an admittedly overlong yet thoroughly engaging effort that brings a fresh spin to the old fish out of water formula disney s self mocking combination of animation and live action is not without its charm  but so slim is the satire that the result comes dangerously close to resembling a cheap imitation by a moderately talented wannabe its gimmick allows  in our post ironic era  big musical production numbers in central parkthere is no doubt about it   amy adams is the sole reason walt disney pictures   enchanted  is so  well  enchanting  t hink of it as the purple rose of cairo for kids lo and behold  the film held my interest the whole way through  and yes   even made me chuckle here and there it may not win over diehard disney haters  and it doesn t qualify as great filmmaking  but i bet kids will be enjoying this one for decades to come a delightful family friendly holiday confection enchanted is  indeed  enchanting chock full of intriguing twists and turns  plus many memorable musical numbers  this instant disney classic is a pleasant escape that s fun for young and old this modern day  partly animated fairy tale is a cheery love story  yes  but it s also a little scream and a lot of hairspray  cleverly sending up its shamelessly feel good genre yet sending you off with a fizzy high nonetheless the perfect family film for the festive season for a movie filled with magical occurences  enchanted commits a cardinal sin  it forgets to cast a spell on the audience all the fairy taley wrap up is decidedly less wonderful than young morgan s insight and gumption  surrounded by calculated disnifications  she s both imperfect and convincing a cute family comedy that s perfectly safe for even the tots to attend it s adams who casts the spell with its latest movie  enchanted  disney is having some fun at its own expense  gentle fun  it has to be said amy adams provides the pixie dust that turns new york into a land of enchantment enchanted bubbles over with good cheer  due in large part to adams for the wide eyed optimism and innocence she brings to her irony free performance the songs  by  pocahontas  oscar winners alan menken and stephen schwartz  are cleverly written  with each one evoking a disney classic from another period this family film is fun  but essentially paint by numbers the animated sequences are disappointingly flat  the real life parts underwritten  but amy adams works hard and keeps a straight face in the lead  and the time passes amiably enough it quickly becomes obvious that instead of finding a fresh angle of approach  the filmmakers have simply given us yet another fish out of water fantasy a la  splash a triumphant return to form the comic possibilities  once floated  eventually capsize overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink wrap of corporate disney plastic ness beginning like the classic animated stories  with a beautiful princess being rescued by a handsome prince  it raises a laugh immediately with a brilliant send up of the saccharin duets the young lovers usually sing susan sarandon is terrific as the evil queen  timothy spall pops up like a well used wart  and james marsden is the terrifically thick and handsome prince it s not quite as enchanted or magical as it could have been  but this family romp still manages to be good fun  and is lifted by fantastic turns from amy adams and james marsden enchanting  fantastic fun for all the family a charming family friendly film complete with a beautiful music score subversive enough for older brother  sweet enough for kid sis  this cine panto s a safe if not spectacular choice for a chrimbo family outing  the cartoon chipmunk almost steals it  but adams  dippy dazzle is the movie s heart  soul and lungs enchanted  you will be thoroughly delightful and entertaining  this is exactly the type of movie walt disney would make if he were alive today once upon a time  the disney studios showed off a clever way to blend animation and live action for the most part this is a perky delight that takes a cheeky glee in biting the gloved hand that feeds enchanting for most of its running time the dedicated fairy tale fan will have tons of fun spotting all the references  adams  meanwhile  gives one of the comedy performances of the year this magical fantasy in reverse is perhaps the best family film of the year disney can afford to poke fun at a lot of things about itself  and in enchanted  it does exactly that  to largely charming effect a sweet little film for anyone that enjoys blurring the lines between fantasy and reality  climaxes strongly  has moments of greatness and moments of not so greatness the delightful enchanted gives snow white and the seven dwarfs a sweetly subversive spin playing her fairytale character with giddy aplomb  amy adams gives a winsomely energetic performance as the live action version of maiden giselle enchanted offers us five stars worth of amy adams in four stars worth of movie  that s not a bad average there are probably a few actresses who could play the role of an animated disney princess come to life  but let s be thankful it s amy adams who is playing it amy adams does something akin to what johnny depp did in the first pirates picture  take a potentially generic disney movie and invest it with a sublimely inventive performance that takes the overall product to a whole other level the kids and adults can dig this one  though adults may be stricken with disney deja vu by this point to my pleasure  the delightful enchanted stands out in a season full of violent and drug ridden movies if the mere notion of disney returning to their roots doesn t at least bring a tiny bit of a smile to your face  then you are  i m sorry  completely dead inside disney s enchanted is the sweet  lighthearted antithesis to the more serious fare this holiday season  fueled by a thoroughly captivating performance from amy adams maintains a delicate balance between wish fulfillment fantasy and a recognition that the world inhabited by its audience is filled with disappointment as well as with joy   watching amy adams exude her comical charm is alone worth the price of admission sarandon s wicked queen switches it up as a witch on the down low  exuding bad vibes crackling with charismatic menace  even if a bit like a real queen also notorious for not taking a liking in the least to her own royal offspring s choices in women a very nice enjoyable fluffy movie a surprisingly entertaining movie that possesses the trademark disney magic while administering a few well deserved jabs in the ribs at the same time enchanted earns its label as a  family film  by virtue of its ability to captivate audience members both young and old with its buoyant combination of romance  music and fun   enchanted  emerges as one of the most entertaining films of the year it makes for good family viewing    winsomely clever   the first half of this film is just pure joy this is a film walt himself would have been proud of  a family flick that s marvelously gratifying no matter what your age what pushes the film over the top is the terrific turn by adams  who really seems like a disney heroine come to life i walked in there all crabby  tired  bitter  and sad  and i walked out with a beatific smile on my face that not even beowulf could remove entirely amy adams looks and sounds as if she indeed emerges from a fairy tale land adams is somehow more cartoonish than the animated version of giselle at the beginning of the film wonderful family entertainment adams carries enchanted s fairy tale conceit on her tiny shoulders   and on her  it floats as if sprinkled with pixie dust the gag wouldn t work with just anyone in the lead  but adams  openhearted performance never winks  she really does want the best for everyone  and can t fathom why they don t all feel the same if i have my druthers adams will get her second oscar nomination  part of me even hoping she can pull of the same julie andrews mary poppins miracle and actually win the darn golden statue outright maybe it s not a whole new world  but it s one you already know and love quite well disney goes meta in this witty  exuberant musical comedy whose parody and nostalgia serve a sweet and affecting romance portraying a version of disney s snow white   adams  owns the character  down to every warble and twirl an inspired disney fairy tale mash up enchanted is not a perfect movie     but it is so thoroughly delightful when adams is on screen you forgive its faults with a smile what could have been an epic disney misfire is saved by the charming adams wonderful performances by amy adams and james marsden as the real life versions of a classic disney princess and her prince charming  they are magnificent enchanted isn t just a culture clash fable  it s also a throwback to one of classic hollywood s giddiest genres  the screwball comedy charming  i wanted to sing all the way home and make some clothes out of my favorite curtains the film  anchored by an entrancing performance by amy adams and a strong ensemble cast  is cleverly written  the situations are funny  and the story feels effortlessly entertaining surprisingly sophisticated riff on animated fairy tale movie cliches how refreshing it is that enchanted gently makes fun of disney tradition while upholding it at the same time  there are no cheap or vulgar jokes  and sentiment never turns to treacle an irresistible blend of screwball comedy and disney fairy tale musical  enchanted takes its enchanting premise and prances away with it  holding the audience happily captive enchanted squeaks by on the charm of its performers  particularly adams enchanted hits every high note  and a great family film that entertains both the kids and adults is something we can all be truly thankful for enchanted is worth seeing for adams  and children will adore the slapstick performers  including a prominently featured cgi chipmunk adams  performance is the kind that deserves an academy award nomination yet seldom gets one cute and clever enough to enchant little girls    not to mention their mothers the film affectionally spoofs animated fantasy formulas it s obvious but inescapable  enchanted is as good as its name disney satirizes its own princess megabusiness    but still goes for the standard payoffs    with this funny story of a fairy tale heroine who finds herself in real life new york city there s plenty to enjoy here it s novel  it s amusing and it can t help but peter out in the third act as the screenplay trucks toward a big apple showdown between good and evil  by this time  enchanted is merely coasting on adams  considerable charm  it s enough a gently meta fairy tale that pokes fun at disney s animated classics  just never too hard to hurt enchanted manages the trick of recasting sugar spun disney fairy tales of old into a winning  modern day comedy  walt disney would be impressed a heart winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality  if you see what i mean  i m not sure i do the sight of adams gliding and beaming and chirping in this movie is just about the happiest time i ve had watching an actor do anything all year adams is truly magical  she brews up her most transfixing expressions when words fail her the jokes rarely miss and the result is a refreshingly sardonic fairy tale amy adams is absolutely adorable as the enchanting fish out of water princess silly yet never quite satirical  it s like shrek without his teeth smart  sassy and sweet but   never vulgar or mean  it s a knowing but not condescending modern family friendly fairy tale enchanted works its magic largely by sending up some of the very stereotypes that have long been walt disney pictures  profitable stock in trade we believe she is a disney princess  no doubt giselle will be joining her forebears at the theme parks its success is largely due to the casting of amy adams who is simply sensational  she weaves some serious movie magic into this thing  adams has  got a wild eyed spark that suggests she s probably game for just about anything  i hope hollywood doesn t sand her down too much and turn her into a bland star adams gives a great performance  her sincerity is what makes it all work adorable fairy tale is a fabulous family flick while the tongue in cheek comedy plays a major role  there s also a warm  charming story here that makes the movie much more than simple satire enchanted is a sugar spun delight  it s as fluffy as a bunch of newborn bunnies and as cute as an entire collection of buttons eventually peddles the same old ass backwards messages  equating physical beauty with goodness  and positing that a woman s greatest dream is that a hunk will materialize out of thin air and make her a contented homemaker and wife it s silly and sweet  but never cloyingly soenchanted is easily the best disney movie in years  it could even be the best film of the year a great  clever concept  and it s family funa rare  fun  loving lampoon of what made disney great  and one of those special treats you look forward to at holiday time given the possibilities it s not particularly inventive  but it is nice to see a comedy so affectionate with the conventions it spoofs it couldn t be whispier or more disney rific    don t expect any grand philosophies on life beyond  ain t true love grand      but as a way to pass a couple hours in sheer movie movie bliss  you can t go wrong no air quotes or winks at the audience  just a fresh  sweet story  and that s movie magic the best disney fantasy musical since mary poppins  a hilarious  dazzling send up of the thing that made disney what it is today fairy tale princesses adams is daffy and delicious in a star making role  and the script  direction and music are spot on  amy adams is  every disney princess in one ebullient package enchanted charmingly reworks all the old  disney  favorites while incorporating fresh twists of its own disney s gloriously tongue in cheek parody of its own princess genre is notable for how it s g rated heroine makes us realize how far a bit of innocence and optimism can uplift our outlook in today s untrusting world a hugely entertaining  clever comic fairy tale  most of the credit goes to oscar nominee amy adams this charmer of a film runs a little long and is heavy on the cgi dragon  the real special effect is adams  who sings the alan menken and stephen schwartz songs with brio  complementing her vivacious performance it s amy adams who lends the role a heart bigger than the frame can contain  i defy anyone to watch this movie and not fall hopelessly in love with her performance enchantment only goes so far in disney s enchanted  a sometimes clever  other times grating mix of live action and animation that plays tricks with levels of movie reality as the world of fairy tale animation invades contemporary new york one of those rare pieces of  all ages entertainment  that will actually work for all ages  enchanted succeeds most of all as a showcase for its superb leading lady the only thing about the film of any lasting significance is amy adams  the bewitchingly good actress who plays the princess amy adams shines in this fabulous fable about what happens when the fairy tale world takes a bite out of the big apple there are some enchanting aspects in enchanted    the most enchanting being amy adams when it s funny  it s good  but when it takes a turn for the heartwarming  it feels more like a disney knockoff than a send up the charm of the actors  the unabashedly romantic goofiness and the clever winks at classic disney set pieces make the movie not only kid friendly but a guilty pleasure for adults as well a shimmering pastiche of missed opportunities enchanted proves that a motion picture can be light and frothy and yet still be intelligent and emotionally rewarding  as unlikely as it may seem  this is one of the year s best and brightest films enchanted isn t something to get worked up over    not only because it s so boring  but because it can t even be bothered to adhere to its own internal logic an expert blend of comedy  romance and adventure  enchanted will be just as fun for adults as for children simple  relentlessly charming fairytale conjures some old fashioned mouse house magic   and a star making turn from amy adams amy adams is this movie more than lives up to its title  a full blown musical that commutes between disney s patented cartoon universe and the real world with cleverness and grace  this splashy production reminds one of nothing in the disney canon so much as mary poppins essentially postmodern and deconstructivist  what could have been a mishmash of animation and live action  fantasy and realism  cg effects and handdrawn segments  under lima s inspired helm becomes a unified entertainment suitable for kids and adults disney s attempt to out subvert the subversives comes with this often delightful rom com fairytale adams is the wish your heart makes when you want a storybook princess for the ages  she s wicked good tween girls whom the movie is aimed at will have a blast this witty romantic romp playfully spins its story with the required cuteness constantly subverted by a very sharp script enchanted is an enjoyable comedy with several hilarious gags and a genuinely charming performance from amy adams  worth seeing everything a romantic comedy is supposed to bepredictable romantic comedy can t withstand the utter pits of romantic comedy trash two icons of romantic comedy team up for the first time  and the result is a fizzle bullock and grant  like the viewing audience  appear to be waiting for some memorable payoff that lawrence fails to come close to delivering hugh grant and sandra bullock basically play their patented movie selves in this overly familiar romantic comedy about corporate greed  social responsibility  personal promises and budding love structurally  the film s off kilter  the start of the relationship is rushed through  while the supposedly crucial notice period feels increasingly directionless  which leaves the comic strand   and that  by and large  delivers light  fluffy  and enjoyable much of the reason for the film s success is down to the pairing of grant and bullock  and it s easy to see how the film could have been a leaden disaster in the hands of blander actors hugh grant s witty delivery of throwaway lines and sandra bullock s clumsy sincerity appeal to me  i hope their first on screen pairing isn t their last despite bullock s comic flair and hugh grant s charming turn as a bumbling billionaire  they can t carry this romantic comedy just on witty repartee    routine  harmless diversion and little else so much promise  so little follow through they may not be history s most predictable pairing but bullock and grant turn out to be a natural fit  in an odd couple kind of way viewers looking for extremely light  romantic entertainment with a guaranteed happy ending could do worse featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot     and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock something of a disaster    it isn t funny and  though both stars try their best  there s precious little actual story there for them to work with it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo this film is proof positive that bullock and grant can make any film watchable and entertaining  no matter how ineptly made it is this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream according to the script  grant and bullock s characters are made for each other  but you d never guess that from the performances instead of focusing mostly on the budding relationship between the two leads  the movie throws in useless subplots and needless distractions when all we really want is to see grant and bullock fall in love the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare instead of using george and lucy s most obvious differences to ignite sparks  lawrence desperately looks elsewhere  seizing on george s haplessness and lucy s personality tics this is an old fashioned  frankly formulaic star vehicle built for two  and it brings out the best  or at least the most appealing  in its pampered passengers blame marc lawrence for most of the film s flaws    a guiltless film for nice evening out it s a treat   a delightful  witty  improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score    grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun the film s essentially over by the meet cute the shallow characters and simple writing make the movie seem like a cartoonfor once  a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love struck somebodies  but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own a really tired affair hugh grant just grins and grins as if to explain that he knows the material isn t up to par and he s just along for the ride a perfectly likeable romantic comedy  containing not a single unforeseeable plot twist but featuring a good deal of witty dialogue and amusing interaction between the lead characters romantics will be loyal to this movie  but they are after all  romantics so routine  familiar and predictable  it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program this thing works on no level whatsoever for me a charming  banter filled comedy    one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims    and by extension  accomplishments    seem deceptively slight on the surface two weeks notice is one of the more shallow romantic comedies of the year  yet also without a doubt one of the most genuinely funny this is  sandra  bullock and  hugh  grant s show all the way  and they make the most out of a tried and true formula a pleasant romantic comedy i hated every minute of it a tepid romantic comedy that strains not only credulity but patience even more than last week s maid in manhattan  this week s new york comedy is saved from strain by actors it s tough not to like coarse  cliched and clunky  this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock two weeks notice  two minutes would be plenty  thanks bad news  donald trump is in two weeks notice  and he s not even the most annoying thing in the movie some day  sandra bullock and hugh grant will make a perfectly charming romantic comedy together  until then  we have two weeks notice  to remind us that bad things can happen to good ideas decent  but innocuous and offering nary a surprise or unexpected plot or character development  this romantic comedy doesn t possess enough of either obligatory element to appeal to anyone beyond diehard aficionados of the genre wo weeks notice is very much a movie that rides on its co stars  but it rides nicely the film is more perky than actually funny two weeks notice isn t a bad movie  it s just such an automatic  cruise control flick that it s hard to generate excitement the laughs don t come fast and furious  they drop in like long lost relatives it s so muddily written  you ll get lost in silly jokes about building projects and tofu cheesecake feels like three  but hugh grant and sandra bullock have some wonderful moments together  as the airhead boss and the drudge who becomes a swan a romantic comedy so vague and sadly undernourished that it makes one of nora ephron s low cal strawberry sodas seem as tempting as a philip barry feast what seems like a dream team on paper is more of a tedious nightmare on celluloid  where bullock and grant are trapped with their well worn screen personas in a dumb  ultra predictable movie the resulting film has warmth rather than spark  but that ultimately doesn t matter  two weeks notice is an enjoyable bit    fluffy  silly and fine for the season not even grant s shoulders are broad enough to lift a scattershot script that defies explanation in any sort of linear way a romantic comedy that s both funny and warmhearted while the ending is a foregone conclusion  the journey is more clever than cute bullock and grant are such masters of romantic comedy  they make falling in love with them  if not their characters  effortless  fun and rewarding bullock and grant are perfectly paired in two weeks notice  the script allows the two actors to be at their comedic best  even though the film as a whole is amateurish in many ways though bullock and grant more than pass their chemistry test  two weeks notice isn t much of a movie i d watch these two together again in a new york minute in the romantic comedy department  two weeks is smarter than it needs to be apparently  romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn t figure in the present hollywood program  grant and bullock  are so good together that you can easily imagine them doing this again  a la tracy and hepburn  in another flimsy concoction here s a romantic comedy in which the stars actually have some believable chemistry walking into two weeks notice at the end of a hectic day  week  month and year  i wanted it to be a typical romantic comedy starring those two lovable people  sandra bullock and hugh grant  and it was nobody s gonna mistake this trip down predictable lane as shakespeare will click with audiences seeking substanceless diversion  or a change of pace from year end heavyweight titles  those who prefer to be challenged will stay away  wisely a transparent feel gooder some actors have so much charisma that you d be happy to listen to them reading the phone book  hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors the perfect date movie  a light  breezy romantic comedy with more believable characters and genuine charm than its chief competition  maid in manhattan loses steam faster than a cup of hot cocoa on a frozen lake this is a charming fantasy  that would still be entertaining after you ve seen it a few times   once on the big screen and then later at home with some good chinese take out the audience at the theater could be heard in a collective yawn i laughed a little  but in the back of my mind i was secretly planning out how soon i d be able to get back to the theater to see the two towers again the script seemed clever  or maybe it was just the way that hugh grant delivered his lines i like bullock  i like grant  script is serviceable  there have been far worse romantic comedies this year succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen the hard to predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down to earth bullock and the nonchalant grant proves to be sensational  and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment the movie is hardly a masterpiece  but it does mark ms  bullock s best work in some time what should have been a painless time killer becomes instead a grating endurance test an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress producer and writer s previous collaboration  miss congeniality  grant  once again demonstrates himself to be the movies  unrivaled master of sophisticated verbal comedy a formulaic romantic comedy that never quite makes up for in charm what it lacks in originality writer and director marc lawrence keeps the film whistling along at such a giddy and relentless sitcom pace that you tend to overlook the fact that the leads have all the chemistry of a blind date sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team  but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip thin and utterly lacking in tension two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy like strangers who have been set up on a blind date  grant and bullock squirm their way through the exasperatingly inept two weeks notice it s mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch drunk love two weeks notice will find its audience of middle class women infatuated with the pretty woman fantasy of richie rich finding the needle of gold in the dishevelled haystack it s just not very smart like a medium grade network sitcom  mostly inoffensive  fitfully amusing  but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen bullock and grant  who made for memorable interviewees on the red carpet at last year s oscars  are ying and yang personified  this is a couple who could form a franchise as couples constitute the bulk of their audience  is it too much to suggest that romantic comedies occasionally cater to a broader demographic than deluded hetero women what can i write about two weeks notice that i haven t written about every mediocre romantic comedy to come down hollywood s pipeline  grant and bullock  play off each other with nice timing and audience pleasing verve two weeks notice is a defiantly unoriginal film that attempts to coast on the putative charm and speculative chemistry of sandra bullock and hugh grant nannannannannannana thoroughly prosaic and prototypical spooker that commits the cardinal sin of devaluing what made the raw materials of its fable so original and powerful in the first place this remake of a hugely successful japanese horror film is very well acted by naomi watts  it s just not that scary a very strong movie in all the ways you need a horror movie to be strong  but it is a movie that could very obviously be better gore verbinski creates an air of dread that begins with the first scene and never lets up  subtly incorporating elements from the current wave of japanese horror films along the way one of the most intelligent and genuinely scary ghost stories to come around in a long time the ring doesn t have the wiliness or conviction to exploit either a single mother s guilt over child neglect or our collective queasiness over potential bad seeds  it merely alternates these themes and toys with them an edgy  watchable film  but one that makes you feel more squeamish than screamish the ring  about a videotape that kills people  is so full of inconsistencies and plot holes that i stumbled from a recent screening with few answers  and a ton of questions the ring  an elegantly creepy film set in a perpetual seattle rainstorm  is interested more in eerie  unnerving thrills than bloodletting watching the ring won t kill you  but it could bore you half to death the slow pace gives us too much time to think about the story s lapses in logic  and verbinski s style is so conventional that the various scare devices and horror images he throws on the screen feel oddly more comforting than frightening though more expensive and less atmospheric than the japanese picture  the film isn t at all bad a chilling idea  finely executed  in a rare remake success  see it if you dare    but we wouldn t recommend you go alone the ring is easily the most terrifying movie to come out of hollywood in years light years ahead of the half cocked horror coming out of hollywood  the mounting dread provides the requisite amount of chair jolting shocks the movie s nifty beginning all anxiety and dread suggests that the audience is in for a fearful ride  but the one dimensional story quickly runs out of fuel director gore verbinski maintains a consistently unsettling mood and look to the film  even if the story often falls by the wayside a well made remake that adds quite a bit to the original story  alas  the ring also feels dated and dull for a remake and a modern hollywood horror  it s pretty good this movie is very  very scary the movie is a dog from start to finish  with enough genre inconsistencies and plot holes to make it a textbook example of borrowing from too many divergent horror films to get anything right in many ways vastly superior to the original the american version retains much of the original but does little to justify its existence beyond the commercial considerations of relocating the setting to seattle and filling the screen with caucasian faces the creepy exploration of the unknown and unexplainable is far more frightening than the violent killings that typify most horror films a stylish hollywood remake of the japanese horror sensation that unfortunately has little personality of its own elegantly shot by bojan bazelli and designed by tom duffield  with a chilling hans zimmer score  this visually stunning movie serves up generous dollops of designer creepiness what if you watch the tape twice  do you get three and a half days then  if you fast forward through it do you get fourteen  how about pausing it to go to the bathroom  or only watching half  getting bored and turning it off as a concept  it s flawed  as a remake  it s good  as modern horror  it s a firecracker not everything it might have been  then  but decent enough to have you tracking down the original seat moistening     shot by shot faithful to the original film in many instances  yet fully capable of conjuring up molar grinding moments of its own invention there were two points where i thought it was over  and both would have made for better endings than eventual finale just in time for halloween comes gore verbinski s chilling to the bone suspense ride    guaranteed to have you biting your nails long after the film is done sets an atmosphere of creepiness that doesn t let upwhile the ring is not horror flick greatness  it s a good shot of gothic creepiness with enough unsettling scares that will keep you awake at night this is a ghost story where the ghost doesn t really do too much and a character s psychological torment mainly gets inflicted by themselves it has the courtesy to tie up everything with a nice little bow  plus the nifty special effects climax of  the  serious wallop at the end     it s disappointing  losing most of the original s flavour  while retaining and amplifying what was muddled and unsatisfying about it in the first place the pervasive feeling of dread  rather than cheap scares  is what carries the film when it occasionally slips into familiar contrivancesthe ring  is pretty much an english language copy of the film that inspired it  and it carries the same strengths and flaws this dud by director gore verbinski is being marketed as if it were the scariest thing since the blair witch project  the only shock is how incomprehensible it all is where it really scores for me is in watts s intelligent  wordless investigative scenes  as rachel gets on the trail of the malevolent psyche behind the video well acted  satisfactory remake that replicates the creepy atmosphere of the original and  for some reason  throws in a whole bunch of extra stuff involving horses      subtle  quiet  and deeply enigmatic  like a disturbing dream    has its miscues and one can say that the twists and turns are on the borderline of predictability  still  this ring is worth wrapping around your little finger of twitchy suspense gore verbinski creates beautifully composed pictures of unpleasantness throughout    moments that sneak around the memory for days after viewing many critics have mistaken the film s visuals for set design and lighting  but what s unsettling about them is the content  the imagination behind them  they slide under your skin in ways that very few modern horror films have nonsensical yet satisfyingly sleek and suspenseful not knowing any more than the trailer and ads told me was one of the joys of the experience not since the sixth sense has a film built up the horror and suspense so effectively one of the best american style thrillers we ve seen in a long time the scariest thing about this festival of loose ends is the thought of just how much must have gotten lost in the translation dark  disturbing and original throughout a good night out for those who want something creepy that will stick with you for a while after seeing it for a movie built around a piece of film containing unsettling images  the ring is itself a rather tame undertaking it s a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill  naomi watts is terrific as rachel  her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation the fear is not so much of physical danger  but of just the impenetrability of the mystery i m now officially scared of being alone in the same room with a television the cinematography by bojan bazelli is thoroughly atmospheric  making a sharply incisive visual contribution to the theme of demonic powers i found the ring moderately absorbing  largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound a ridiculous  confusing mess that just doesn t make any sense the  death tape  of the ring is nearly as incomprehensible as mulholland drive  at least naomi watts eventually makes sense of this one in an era of hiply self referential teen horror  verbinski cribs from the genre s best and gets back to the basics of disquieting creepiness and stylish  atmospheric scares a bona fide saturday night chill fest that tries to creep you out by getting under your skin the ring is relentlessly disquieting and incoherent  and sometimes trite in ways it doesn t need to be successfully envelops us in a disturbing experience its dearth of cohesive reasoning will leave you shaken but frustratingly unstirred despite my reservations  the ring works by the time the last reel has unraveled  so has the movie  whose endless puzzles keep accumulating until the ideas that once fueled them have turned on themselves it s too     six years ago creeps you out in high style  even if nakata did it better it will    make you think twice about watching any of those video tapes with no labels on the bottom of your entertainment center the ring has enough frights to satisfy the big crowdsthe ring is a surprisingly effective creeper the film does contain a few moments of real terror  and watts demonstrates at least a smidgen of the genius she showed in last year s mulholland drive it s the kind of effectively creepy scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can t take it any more effective  layered  genuinely and intelligently scary  and a fun ride as well  please read review  a  subtle  dreamlike spooker that pits a seattle journalist against a sinister videotape full of ominous  threatening images the basic narrative is so convoluted and  in many ways  quite silly that the explanations end up looking strained and contrived and  ultimately  unsatisfactoryturning a great movie into a pretty good one is still a step in the wrong direction    and the ring will never be more than a pretty good movie    a distinctive  eerie  unsettling and suggestive film on every cylinder  and for a film that contains few orthodox horror elements  it s also damn good and what it does this is a very well done  creepy film that will scare audiences for years to come a movie doesn t have to be good to be really scary arguably the most intelligent horror film in many years  it s a movie with undeniably high aspirations should be seen and absorbed  if only to recall that hollywood horror does  occasionally  get it more or less right a very creepy ghost story that is long on atmosphere and mercifully short on blood and gore there is a whole lot of fuss about nothing in this film and enough red herrings for a pod of orcas to feast on for a week this should convince the holdouts to scrap their vcrs and get with the dvds anyone who gets chills from movies with giant plot holes will find plenty to shake and shiver about in  the ring  you might not buy all of it  but you still enjoy getting tweaked by every twist of its goose flesh inducing storytelling although elitists will complain that the american version is inferior  dreamworks  the ring is a thoughtful  persuasive  and at times deeply frightening film that should find an appreciative audience the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear the creepiest  clammiest  twitchiest squealfest in months at times  the suspense is palpable  but by the end there s a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere  the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious  it s painful  the ring  is a genuinely chilling tale that provides more scares than most of its ilk it casts a spell over us with its disturbingly matter of fact visuals and with allusions to abandoned asylums  twisted families and otherworldly evil shows surprising restraint for an american remake  effective atmosphere from cinematographer bojan bazelli  good acting from watts and some nice surprises verbinski does manage to set up and deliver a decent array of spooky  eerie and yes  scary scenes and imagery so good it s scary much less than the sum of its stylish parts  but for a while there  it ll curl your hair  or your toes  or whatever it is you ve got that curls up when you re getting the holy popcorn scared out of you watts holds our attention and sympathy  even when the plot floats into the ether offers decent enough thrills  but a few too many of them feel a mite cheap verbinski implements every hack artist trick to give us the ooky spookies verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action  tedium for thrills it s not often a movie can make you rant about the lousy ending and give you nightmares delivers on its promise to scare the living daylights out of those willing to take the journey with the unsuspecting characters in the movie the ring trades run of the mill revulsion for extreme unease  starting with the mysterious video itself    a montage of stark  black and white grotesqueries and symbolic objects it s truly a fascinating mind game that twists and turns itself into your subconscious a thought provoking horror film that packs a visceral wallop the most unsettling and inspired horror film since the blair witch project one of creepiest  scariest movies to come along in a long  long time  easily rivaling blair witch or the others it s far better than most gimmicky horror films rarely has a more serious effort produced a less serious result there s nothing happening behind all the imagistic dada gothic frights and supernatural spookiness make this a stylish guilty pleasure a good scary movie will make you want to cover your eyes  and the ring succeeds almost too well americanized remake of japanese horror smash is a smart  disturbing and striking horror movie be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat  tense with suspense  the ring never lets you off the hook ok  you might buy that a mischievous she demon could imprint a vcr tape with disturbing  chaotic images  but the  be kind  rewind  sticker is a bit much stylish but distressingly generic and not particularly scary transmits eerie imagery  nail biting tension and excellent chills though the ring is only a copy  it still can carry the echo of a real chill delivers some genuinely scary moments it may not be perfect  but the ring makes a skin crawling candidate for one of the scariest movies to hit the screen this year a deviously engineered parasite that ll crawl under your skin and live in your nervous system for a while if you give it half a chance it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times  but is just too lame to work or be cool at others a script seemingly built from pieces of other scary movies     comes off as fresh and original often disquieting  always haunting  and ultimately horrific   the ring  is one of the few films that approaches the exorcist in its ability to terrify the movie is utterly unable to tie up its admittedly creepy ideas with any degree of coherencefull of    the kind of horrors that are close enough to being a real part of the human experience that they send you into a kind of despair take a date and hold on tight even if the ring has a familiar ring  it s still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror a frighteningly good horror movie with enough solid scares to freeze the blood of ardent fans and newcomers alike while impressively made  this impassive and cold feature fails  in a spectacular fashion  to deliver the thrills the ring is a mind bending blast of eerie atmospherics and trippy visuals trades on a tiresomely familiar conceit  death by videotape this here is high concept cinema  and the filmmakers will spend the next two hours trying to pound that into your noggin the phone rings and a voice tells you you ve got seven days left to live  then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn t back at blockbuster before midnight  you re going to face frightening late fees  o k   not really it s up to  watts  to lend credibility to this strange scenario  and her presence succeeds in making us believe imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you ve imagined the ring the film s murkiness and muted colors suggest the malaise of the treacherous limbo into which the characters wander in the final reel  the tension dissipates with a flabby hiss  as the film devolves into a banal  conventional ghost story more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat deeply unsettling  occasionally exasperating movie if your senses haven t been dulled by slasher films and gorefests  if you re a connoisseur of psychological horror  this is your ticket even if parts don t hold up in the daylight  the chill will stick to your bones good horror movies keep you up at night  and i m really tired today something has been lost in the translation   another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise the movie seems to have been slapped together without concern about whether anything makes sense a very elegantly crafted piece of gothic snuff hokum viewers of  the ring  are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes belief does need to be suspended to buy into the ring s story  but once you ve done that  you re in for a great ride the ring is worth a look  if you don t demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment displaying a storytelling confidence unseen in most genre pictures  the ring succeeds in being the most terrifying film to hit theaters since the blair witch project the ring is fine cinema  blessed with an unusual respect for the horror genre and its own inherent silliness brrrrrrrrrrrr    definitely the scariest movie that i ve seen so far this year by the book hollywood remake a remarkably original and terrifying ghost tale it tries to become a brainy horror movie without bothering to plug its many plot holes large enough to drive anyone with half a brain to distraction with its draggy middle section  the ring quickly deteriorates into just another collect the clues puzzle movie the suspense is restrained and subtle  with some genuinely delicious scares boasts a real heart stopper of a finale an uncanny phosphor nightmare that depicts a marrow deep fear shared by every kid who grew up in the video age it s been awhile since horror has been so nicely placed in a social context  the ring is a gotta see for those wanting to get creeped out a merciless thriller  threateningly beautiful to look at and eerie to behold these people are so passive and joyless that we re not concerned about whether watching the tape will kill them  they all seem dead already although the ring has horror picture elements  it is more of an intriguing mystery and detective story than a shocker it s not the sixth sense  but close enough the best horror film since  the sixth sense    the changeling  and  psycho    with a timely halloween release  it s an eerie  enigmatic scare story about a supernatural videotape  sure  it s an implausible gimmick movie   but how gullible are you  i suspethough not quite as anxious or callous as stigmata  the ring has been similarly put together with attention deficit disorder gets too literal  then goes overboard into outright ludicrousnessthe result is a film that lacks the coherence  and the subsequent horror  of the japanese oeuvre and made me just want to get the thing over with an undeniably creepy  unnerving experience that turns mundane things    a refrigerator door  a ringing telephone  tv static    into moments of terrific suspense    the ring is far scarier than any of the recent so called horror flicks to hit theaters   compelling  yet dissappointing nannannan    almost two and a half hours in which  julia roberts  displays her charisma     full review in spanish an engaging but deliberate chick flick at times  eat  pray  love has the quintessential chick flick star at the helm with roberts  who played the role beautifully    the unexamined privilege  the idealization exotification of all places east  the canned spirituality  the sensual goddamn spaghetti it s all so focus group tested and oprah approved and self perpetuating and embarrassing  let s face it  there are some books that should never be made into movies this gentle  meditative  well told tale has a lot to offer eat pray love is overlong and quickly becomes tedious  it features narcissistic  inward looking characters of no interest at all and amounts to a very poorly made film liz maybe the most unlikeable character julia roberts has ever had to play  not because co writer director ryan murphy is trying to make her so but because everything the film does pushes her in that direction a seemingly interminable romantic travelogue that feels as though it takes as long to watch as the year long spiritual quest it depicts the film version is pure wish fulfillment fantasy julia s late career seems an apologia for buying someone else s husband and getting away with it  for the most part  in the court of public opinion during the india scenes  liz accuses richard from texas of spouting a bunch of bumper sticker slogans    as though her revelations are any better  takes  itself too seriously  even while it contains all the trappings of one of the most lighthearted movie genres  the  travel romance  or  travel therapy  movie full review at movies for the massesmerely good and not great as many fans of the book hoped it would be eat pray love is a two hour and fifteen minute ad for being rich  it s a smug  patronising travelogue that    despite its already apt title    could have also been called first world problems  the movie  on the surface a beautiful film  but those looking for some hidden spiritual meaning be warned   eat pray love doesn t go that deep eat pray love      hits  its target demographic right between the eyes  but in the same way that a self help book may appeal to thousands  it will never be great literature  narcissistic nonsense  styled within an inch of its life in the manner of food  fashion and travel magazines the fatal flaw of eat pray love is that for a celebration of enlightenment through travel and the benefits of restorative calm  the end result is so hollow and artificial  don t mistake entitlement for enlightenment a tiresome  humourless  lifeless  overlong dirge in which the lofty pretention to say something deep about the quest for self and the female condition all gets blown away by an insipid  off the shelf romantic movie ending the chemistry shared by roberts and bardem is alert  alive and alluring  everything the rest of eat pray love should have been  but shied away from the director  ryan murphy  brings only the most obvious sentiments to the borderline intolerable proceedings there s too much eating  too much praying and too much loving  i should have known given the title basically a picaresque rom com about a girl who needs to feel ok about having everything she could ever want it is a perfectly competently constructed movie  and an enjoyable one too give me real emotions of guilt  embarrassment and confusion any day over the forgettable trite this film exudes while undeniably a chick flick  this is a classy one bolstered by an all round excellent cast and well crafted script while it touches the main plot points of elizabeth gilbert s bestselling novel like stepping stones  it is left to julia roberts  bewitching smile and javier bardem s sensuality to convince us that liz s journey of self discovery is one we want to takepreaching to the converted  fans of the book should be sated  julia roberts is easy to love eat lots of popcorn to distract you  pray for it to end  and love richard jenkins  amen it s in equal measure patronising  sententious and obnoxious a sparkier and more soul searching script would have made this a much more satisfying journey an insipid slice of take charge of your life hokum   a film titled eat pray love should at least capture a spiritual experience and offer romance with some sizzle  this felt more like eat grieve befriend roberts is luminous against breathtaking locations including all of rome s landmarks and colourful  sun nourished eastern landscapes a movie of picture postcard landscapes and ridiculously hunky blokes  this is very much cinematic comfort food where the answers to life s problems come a little too neatly gift wrapped in the end  the film is far less affecting or thought provoking than the book sit  watch  groan  yawn  fidget  stretch  eat snickers  pray for end of dire film about julia roberts s emotional growth  love the fact it can t last for ever  wince  daydream  frown what s the worst foreign journey you ve ever experienced  mine is this movie roberts  character is difficult to feel sorry for before she sets off on this postcardperfect self healing binge  she becomes near impossible to like as it becomes apparent we re watching a huge holiday video the cast is spectacular  roberts looks relaxed  luminous and credible  javier bardem is suitably rugged as her new lover  while richard jenkins is brilliant as her grumbling prayer pal an intriguing story brimming with possibilities is softened beyond all meaning by this glossy hollywood production a beautiful  languid travelogue  although with some of the source novel s empowerment diluted the movie is aware of its own riches  it fills up your plate and dares you not to eat if you like roberts and understand what it means to   smile with your liver    this is the film for you avoid like plague eat pray love has some decent performances and the occasional good moment but it s ultimately let down by a tedious  self satisfied script  a shocking lack of humour and a criminally indulgent running time i admired julia roberts  grasping for something meatier  but this film sticks her with an unrelatable character that even her coltish smile can t beautify a drive through take on mid life spirituality   with lots of food and travel pornwe re not so much involved in the movie as idly registering it    eavesdropping  almost  on a conversation at an adjoining table enough compelling moments to make one want to grab the book and fill in the blanks that the movie s script seems to have left out eat  pray  love was more like eat  pray for it to end  gag  sample from its menu at your own risk though many movies have explored eastern culture and juxtaposed it against the american experience  there still is something to learn here  especially because it repeatedly questions what s important in life it does focus on spirituality  a vital part of most human beings which nevertheless is absent in most films     is  elizabeth  gilbert really the selfish  shallow  immature narcissist we see here you have got to be kidding me go pay sufferthe absolute best i can say about this movie is that i didn t hate it  i didn t mind watching it and i see no reason to ever watch it again     a self indulgent  annoying and mostly boring movie little more than a self indulgent wallow in white upper class privilege feigning depth by cloaking itself in fortune cookie wisdomwhat s inevitably lost is any real attempt to track liz s internal shifts  the way her travels jostle her preconceived notions of selfhood and spirituality as summer draws to a close  eat pray love is a pleasurable  sometimes even prayerful  escape despite splendid scenery and an appealing julia roberts  the film of elizabeth gilbert s best seller about her year long spiritual quest fails to capture the humor and uplift of the book fans of the memoir might enjoy this film  others will be checking their watches more than once  i saw it  i didn t feel it  look  i m happy for julia roberts to travel the world  i just never felt connected to the journey of liz  the audience may find itself wondering how it is that liz manages to find so many places around the world that can maintain her carefully highlighted hair rather than contemplating the spiritual journey try not to hoot when the gaunt roberts makes a bring on the flab speech to persuade the equally slender tuva novotny to eat pizza  even if they get  muffin tops a nice leisurely pace the result isn t spiritual awakening  but a talky travelogue   like riding a tour bus with a passenger who won t shut up about her inner journey julia roberts continues to be one of our finest actresses  and she makes this film less tedious than it could have been  it s a shame the actors have to spoil cinematographer robert richardson s artistry by reciting the drivel that passes for dialog rodney  dangerfield  may have cracked about  praying after you eat   but this film reflects the need to surfeit before finding balance let the cynics scoff   this is a movie that s beautiful to look at that will leave you with some food for thought  as well  while eat pray love has some enlightening  touching  visually breathtaking moments  you still end up praying it would end eat  pray  love  more like eat  pray  snooze roberts is precisely the right actress to play this character  she adamantly refuses to be adorable    she d rather just unleash that crazy  unladylike cackle if you re in the mood for a julia roberts film that provides two hours of  calgon take me away   this is it if you ve ever been on a vacation that becomes an adventure of meeting interesting  vibrant people   eat pray love  will bring you back if only this movie could have stopped at  eat the movie left me with the feeling of being trapped with a person of privilege who won t stop with the whine whine whine do you always talk in bumper sticker  julia roberts asks richard jenkins as they banter back and forth at an ashram in india  yes  he does  and so does eat pray love  exotic  escapist and superficially spiritual  it s shallow  indulgent female wish fulfillment  sailing off into the sunset betray devour invade  would have been a more appropriate title  the movie  which was shot in chronological order in the countries gilbert visited  is also visually striking  more reminiscent of a travelogue than a hollywood blockbuster eat pray love is ultimately charming and inspirational  though it doesn t have quite the impact of the book  it will likely leave you pondering your life choices and forgiving your flaws  it will certainly have you forgiving the few flaws in the film  this is the rare  chick flick  that treats its demographic with respect  never becoming the sentimental or manipulative dreck that so many other filmmakers would have delivered from elizabeth gilbert s bestselling memoirs eat pray love is like an overstuffed lightweight suitcase  with little room for us to feel the emotional connections liz makes with new friends along the way hanging out with julia roberts being all glowy and charming    even when she s somewhat sad about whatever it is she s sad about    is still kind of pleasurable eat pray love only superficially advocates independence and growth while serving up a steaming pile of pseudo spiritual hyperbole  this film is about a woman trying to move mountains to make herself happy  and the singular quest of every other character in the movie is to serve her in that quest  an insane fantasy for rich people eat pray love  rests on roberts  talented shoulders  her appeal and personality overcome most of the film s defects  including a too long running time  and some platitudes and words of wisdom that sound as if they were written by hallmark it may come as a bit of a shock to some that the most interesting turns in the woman on a quest sojourn don t belong to roberts  luminous though she is  those are owned by a number of misty eyed if masculine menfolk goldilocks and the three boy toys  while in search of the chick flick demographic  the misguided message is that hedonism is the new feminism  but liz does learn a few things  like mastering the art of guilt free eating and embracing your inner fatty eat  pray  love  barf    a celebration of self indulgence trying to pass itself off as profound soul searching the movie is above all a lovely travelogue  plunging us viscerally into the middle of every country i stopped trusting the movie it s all external trappings trying to express internal developments  and the movie s hand holding stridency just emphasizes the artificiality of its fantasy there s something ridiculously and deeply sad about what eat pray love reveals about the deprived lives american women lead find your bliss film appeals but raises questions  too one wonders  was the screenplay presented to julia roberts as a traditional bound manuscript  or as a catalog of bumper stickers for two decades  julia roberts has been a bona fide movie star  and she shines in his gorgeous if overlong travelogue eat pray love is a long marathon full of self pity and poor interaction eat pray love presents liz s road to enlightenment in ways that are too reverent  too episodic  and too self absorbed it s a thin line between  self aware  and  self involved  and it s one the movie treads uncertainly despite its flaws  an intelligent  beautiful looking film about the power of one person to radically change the life of another is an unexpected treat in a season of mindless entertainment a hornet s nest of irrational behavior  wrapped up snugly in a smug  shallow  and diseased feature film that does a masterful job brainlessly wiggling around for an interminable amount of screentime  the film s most crucial constituency    the book s rabid fans    are likely to feel well served by murphy s adaptation  which hews pretty faithfully to gilbert s story a vacuous attempt at chick flick epiphany  for all its postcard prettiness  eat pray love s purported life lessons are so self absorbed  had our shallow heroine been a man  we d be booing his caddish behaviour you know exactly what you are going to get  kinda like comfort food for your movie going soul comes off more like a female midlife crisis fantasy than a substantive search for knowledge and inner peace eat pray love is the cure for insomnia  the film is boring and a gigantic advertisement for the travel channel  food network and lifetime  it s about something important  the search for meaning and happiness  about finding one s inner life amid the clutter and confusion of modern existence     an irritating  smug film about a horrible person  a narcissistic destroyer of worlds so caught up in romancing her impossibly sensitive self that she doesn t even notice the needless damage she inflicts on her fellow creatures eat pray love is mostly a slog  never giving us a compelling reason why its heroine does what she does  or how she became quite so tiresomely self  absorbed i ve got a fourth verb to add to the comma challenged title of julia roberts  how to be happy travelogue  eat pray love  how about  edit  most of what made the book connect with so many is entirely missing here was something lost in translation or was the source material not as strong as book sales would have us believe overlong  repetitive  too simplistic  and bland despite oodles of breathtaking scenery  it s like a healthy dish that looks aesthetically pleasing  but lacks flavor and needs a more talented chef  at the end of the two and a half hours we get to the same point of all the other stereotypical chick flicks  this is an overly intellectual version of any other jennifer lopez or kate hudson romantic comedy the film  which admittedly stumbles in the home stretch and just misses out on something like greatness  is nonetheless a visual and metaphysical delight  come hungry  come searching  come lonely  these  are not the teachings one would find for oneself but things out of a self help book  they feel planned it s hard to call this a bad movie as it is wonderfully and beautifully shot and directed  but its failure to grasp any meaning in its end and its steady decent into boredom make it a failure as a movie overall i found the woman to be selfish  narcissistic and by the time everything was over i didn t actually believe she learned anything new about herself at all eat pray love lies across the screen like a patient on life support whose ticker is about to tick its last tock a minor and superficial summer diversion that offers female viewers not much more than a two hour escape fantasy awesome photography but possessing more schmaltz than herring shoppers will find at zabar s on a sunday shopping spree there were plenty of ways for the film to signify liz welcoming love back into her life without the trite conclusion that has been conceived here  and it is the one drawback to an otherwise pretty fantastic picture glibly portrays selfishness as a life choice  ranking gluttony on a par with finding god and a life partner it helps that roberts rides all the turbulent waves with such ease and such grace  that jenkins knows exactly what to do with his internal churn  and that bardem can do no wrong an ambitious but confused and frustrating film that circles near catharsis  occasionally brushing its hem  but that s about as close as it ever gets supply acted and engrossing the book s internal dialogue  that of a good observer with a lively mind  has turned into the extravagantly external and cloyingly earnest quest of a woman in deep distress  roberts  has a down to earth  everywoman quality that adds to the film s  you go  girl  mojo lives are messy  a little mess in the movie wouldn t have hurt at all most of its supposed observations sound more like touchy feely mumbo jumbo than honest  useful information and advice this is a movie about a self obsessed woman who seems to learn that the wisdom of the ancients is that she should be even more self obsessed  you know your movie s in trouble when its star is outshined by a bowl of spaghetti an effective and frequently satisfying indulgence  but not nearly as much as the book was ryan murphy brings elizabeth gilbert s best selling self realization memoir to the big screen as a glossy  julia roberts starring travelogue that gives more insight into where to get a great pizza than the benefits of striving for enlightenment let us not underestimate the contribution of our lead  roberts plays down the glamour and turns up the soulfulness  and her off the charts likability makes her winning and watchable  even when liz is at her whiny wimpiest roberts is the obvious focus here  but she s enough of a pro to get out of the way and let a scene be stolen vibrant editing  an intelligible screenplay  and a magnetic performance by julia roberts keep eat  pray from dipping too far into self indulgence  its span may be global  but its scope is modest  and it accepts a certain superficiality as the price of useful insight the film knows the aesthetic of enlightenment  the filmmakers demonstrate adoration for their subject  but whether or not the film grasps the principle further is very arguable only hard core fans of oprah s bff will be able to stomach this navel gazing tripe  which posits  me first  consumerism as the road to happiness watching the relationship between liz and felipe evolve from a comforting friendship to a love that s both companionable and sexy is gratifying a well meant  if not exactly transcendent  adaptation of elizabeth gilbert s beloved  oprah endorsed memoir eat pray love will be an intense spiritual experience for many who see it   they will end up on their knees  praying for its merciful end an overlong bore that either mistakenly thinks it s something more than a humdrum romance or has incorporated a variety of pretentions as window dressing a sensuous and emotionally cathartic adaptation of elizabeth gilbert s spiritual journey to personal transformation and love goldilocks and the three boy toys  while in search of the chick flick demographic  the misguided message is that hedonism is the new feminism  but liz does learn a few things  like mastering the art of guilt free eating and embracing your inner fatty at the moment  the only person eating more delectably in italy is tilda swinton in i am love though there are a handful of funny lines  the deeper observations are facile  the whole journey feels like a rich girl gone slumming elizabeth gilbert s phenomenally popular memoir was funny  insightful  and well written  amazingly  so is the film  the superficial eat pray love wants to chronicle a person s rejuvenation through revelatory life experience  but it feels like tapas for the soul the film is a fairly faithful transcription of events  even though liz  as played by roberts  carries a faint air of entitlement  i m not sure this could be avoided on screen murphy s film version of the story is relentlessly superficial  a slick  empty travelogue propped up only by roberts  natural charisma like any beloved book with a pretty film version  there will be fans of this film  in spite of its flaws  and bless them  i was  mostly  frustrated julia roberts boasts a charming presence and a lively mind but she deserves better than this superficial  glitzy and fluffy travelogue of self discovery  which has lots of food  some prayers but little love or sex elizabeth gilbert s best selling tome has been dumbed down and glossed up  fans of the introspective will be disappointed  those looking for decent  escapist entertainment will not approached purely on the surface  eat serves a sensual cinematic meal it seems determined to drag tears out of the audience  when the quiet  underplayed moments are the ones that pack the true firepower if only roberts  warmth  coupled with javier bardem s scruffy sexiness as felipe  were enough to compensate for the folded map flatness of this production it provides a gorgeous escape  exquisitely photographed and full of female wish fulfillment  yet it also offers sufficient emotional heft and self discovery to make you feel as if you ve actually learned something unlike the book  there s no big emotional breakdown  instead  this is a postcard pretty case of midlife soul searching ryan murphy s film adaptation of elizabeth gilbert s bestseller about the divorced new yorker s lone odyssey to italy  india and bali to find meaning in her life is a shallow guilty pleasure  an escapist julia roberts romance and exotic travelogue  the food looks great  but the romance is undercooked  and god remains strictly a bit player eat pray love isn t a bad movie    just a spiritually dead one  wearing and wearying too preachy  indulgent  and everybody cries  even the extras italians have a phrase  che posso fare   meaning  what can i do   that s sometimes used when the answer is   nothing  just go with it   lots of things happen in eat pray love that only the lonely and book club members will understand  you just go with it nannans there a heart wrenching back story to explain why diana is the way she is  yes  did i laugh  yes  this film just made me want to crawl up into a ball and cry  and i pretty much did  not because the film is sad or anything  just because it is that unbelievably putrid identity thief is one of those failed attempts to capture comedy magic it is a creaky start  and matters fail to become smoother from there there s something to offend everyone in identity thief  racist jokes  gay jokes  the word  vagina  wielded as an insult don t see it identity thief exhausts you with slapstick  though occasionally funny and filled with amusing bit performances identity thief s deeply unlikable co protagonist stops this would be buddy comedy in its tracks up until he becomes somewhat manly  bateman s character s supreme ineptness is less funny than nerve wracking  there s way more grossness than hilarity  don t get conned director seth gordon s best film since his brilliant debut   the king of kong  a fistful of quarters    suffers from an often unwatchable first half that admittedly does give way to a passable final stretch      utterly confused over what to do with mccarthy as a physical comedienne it s like midnight run while at the same time completely missing what makes midnight run work  melissa mccarthy deserves better you don t care enough about these people to want to see them come out on top bateman and mccarthy thrash around in the dark for laughs that never come this ugly and rather mean spirited film  with jokes that are so lowbrow they re totally underfoot  creaks through a number of recycled road trip gags the gags mostly grab at low hanging fruit  frittering away the marvelous potential of jason bateman and melissa mccarthy on an odd couple road trip  the natural charisma of the two leads is about the only thing that saves identity thief  it s a very generic  very lazy hollywood comedy very little about identity thief is original  after a brief introduction that leads to sandy and diana travelling across the country together  viewers are saddled with a story that s essentially a road movie with an odd couple twist bateman and mccarthy seem inspired enough to make this janky old jalopy of a story somewhat entertaining  playing to type with a lukewarm script sure  the two leads deserve better material  but there are enough laughs here to make up for a lot of creative mistakes casting isn t one of them    a yawner plot set up that leads to lots of wannabe off colour gags  a small army of pursuing villains and an expected final act in which jason s icky sticky niceness might perhaps stop mccarthy from being a shrieking psychopath formulaic multiplex mulch  way over long  often feels strained   that said  identity thief is the latest example of the disconnect that often exists between critical opinion and popular appeal  slammed by critics the low budget film has been a huge hit identity thief molests the idea of the  odd couple  beyond recognition don t let identity thief steal two hours of your life  the film s darker elements are brushed aside and we re left with a zany  feel good finale an unwieldy and unfunny farce that s robbed of comic potential through its reliance on shrill mayhem over wit when the plot feels like you ve seen it three times before  and done better on each of those occasions  the movie better have something else going for it  identity thief doesn t the first thing i did after returning from the screening was take two painkillers for my throbbing headache  a man can only withstand so much shrill shrieking and faux screwball antics there s probably a funny film buried somewhere deep within this concept of a morally corrupt protagonist  whose compulsion to steal identities finds her facing off with the man whose identity she has stolen  but this isn t itidentity thief features the kind of  humour  which says you don t just hit a person once  you should do it repeatedly to make it funnier the film is painfully unfunny  almost literally so there s real potential in this premise for a ripping screwball comedy anchored by two likeable actors  but the filmmakers simply don t trust the material  stirring in constant elements of action mayhem that don t work at all feeble as comedy  the movie is needlessly violent  too  as if half the crew misguidedly thought they were making a foul mouthed action thriller the real crime here is the waste of comic talent all pretty feeble stuff without the irrepressible force of comic mayhem that is melissa mccarthy  road movie comedy identity thief would end up in the ditch  luckily  the bridesmaids co star barrels her way through the plot s stickiest patches identity thief starts off moronic and then goes downhill it is reliant on mccarthy s comedy chops and her ability to deliver improv type character material  but almost every single one of her scenes looks like an outtake bateman and mccarthy are so fabulous in the overall  apart from this crap  and they  as actors and human beings  do not warrant the treatment they get here cheap laughs  cheap stunts  cheap characters and with absolutely nothing important to say identity thief is low on laughs and has a number of plot problems but the comic performances from bateman and mccarthy ensure that it stays watchable  a  laugh free affair despite the presence of the ever reliable jason bateman and a supporting cast including jon favreau the hit rate isn t as high as you d hope  gag wise  but melissa mccarthy and jason bateman remain highly likeable screen presences  even when behaving in unlikeable and unlikely ways there s barely a laugh to be found in this new comedy from horrible bosses director seth gordon it saddles bateman with a thankless uptight straight man role while heaping serial slapstick ignominies on his co star  who gamely bounds through everything the script throws at her the film s best moments are when mccarthy is left to her own improvisational devices with the camera still running  and that doesn t happen often enough clever premise  witless execution identity thief isn t a great comedy in the class of mccarthy s bridesmaids  but it s still a decent one        mccarthy  goes for it bugs bunny meets the roadrunner meets all three stooges style  it s just that the movie she s single handedly trying to save isn t worth her effort a wasted opportunity  put the two leads in a movie that didn t lazily rely on its high concept to do the work  and you d really have something to laugh about when a straightforward description of the plot is funnier on an ironic level than any joke in the film  you re in for a bad time  should have been a frothy farce  but instead takes several different attitudes  including action  melodrama  and mean spirited nihilism  none of those are particularly successfulidentity thief  gives melissa mccarthy her full  fledged feature film starring role  but the result is dispiriting  to say the least identity theft is perfectly performed  often wildly funny  and a great movie night option for the not easily embarrassed bateman and mccarthy are asked to mine a garbage heap of gagswhile the two leads are likable enough  they deserve better  especially mccarthy  her range is criminally misused here    it s almost as if someone stole her comedic identity and committed a bad film in her name  a  funny  though formulaic  mismatched duo comedy    the latest movie featuring chris farley and david spade really stinks  oh   wait   lazy comedy doesn t mean diddly squat it s not perfect  but it is a wild  n  crazy road trip on the lighter side of a topic that  as a lot of folks have discovered  is no laughing matter  after setting up the professional and emotional devastation jason bateman s character suffers when his identity is stolen  the movie does its best to say   you know what  forget about that  laugh at the crazy car crashes instead identity thief is so bad that i hope it doesn t prematurely squash people s enthusiasm for melissa mccarthy bateman and mccarthy elevate the material to a higher level than it should have the scattered chuckles  while generally crude and obnoxious  might have more resonance if the film had some grounding in authenticity identity thief is funny enough  but it needed to be darker  raunchier  and crazier to live up to the promise of its casting a road movie with its creative lanes clogged  and a mack truck comedian barreling through  anyway  melissa mccarthy  pound for pound the funniest woman in show biz these days  carries this cruel and usual raunchfest practically by default  this is a movie for those who could care less about a bad premise or  for that matter  misfired gags  false sentimentality and obtuse characters the snow might be tricky to predict  but the bad winter movies arrive right on scheduleif identity thief suffers from comedic recession  melissa mccarthy is too small a stimulus package a waste of the talents of melissa mccarthy and jason bateman the theft of identity that s going on here is the fact this thing is falsely advertising itself as a comedyidentity thief is an odd mix of edginess  slapstick  and serious drama that is only occasionally satisfying i came away from  identity thief  with more admiration than ever for melissa mccarthy  but i hope somebody will devise a better vehicle for her talents both bateman and mccarthy are funny  but they really don t have much chemistry  which is essential for a road comedy that locks two people in cars and hotel rooms together it may be too soon to call identity thief the worst film of the year  but there s no doubt that it will be a contender even with all its shortcomings and sentimental fudges  there is something about mccarthy s refusal to lie down and play the victim that gives it a comic edge  a blunt edge  to be sure  but an edge all the same  a  sloppily made exercise of rip offs and redemption the two have palpable chemsitry  but the film s hyper pace keeps pushing them forward when it might have nicer to just let these two make us laughconsidering that it starts out with two distinctive and likable stars and a reasonably promising premise   identity thief  reaches impressive heights of laziness and idiocy identity thief apparently forgets it was supposed to be a comedy identity thief  is a cheap copy of much better comedies great stars can t rescue uneven  sometimes violent comedy thanks to mccarthy s abundant comic gifts and those of her equally ill served straight man jason bateman  identity thief doesn t leave nearly as icky a taste as it could have  but gordon only taps into a fraction of his actors  potential chemistry is the reason things click  actors with the ability to connect their characters to you always overcome a multitude of movie sins  laugh out loud funny with bravura performances by melissa mccarthy and jason bateman and a terrific supporting cast identity thief  tries its best to entertain but half way through it loses its appeal and you ll be ready for the criminal chase to end a lot of movies released into theaters deserve the label of  bad   only a few cross the line into  reprehensible   say hello to identity thief the film has too many characters  too much sentiment and too much time wasting side material and phony baloney  motivation   when the only thing it needs is to let mccarthy do her thing    identity thief   strands these two ordinarily enjoyable comics in the middle of nowhere with no help for miles bateman and mccarthy are left stranded onscreen while we are supposed to be chortling at slobber comedy and fat jokes vulgar and tawdry  it turns a cyber crime into cinematic chaos a self indulgent comedy catchall  one that s saddled with an irony for a title  that is  for a film about the value of identity  identity thief doesn t have a clue about what it wants to be the whole thing s not much of anything  really   just a little more than an hour and a half of crude jokes and clumsy plotting  all wrapped up with a feel good ribbon at the end a few scenes are giggly funny  some are just stupid really  this a two hander that unfolds at two distinctly separate speeds we can forgive the silly setup  without which there can be no film  but like many a road movie  this one has a better start and finish than middle jason bateman and melissa mccarthy make a terrific comedy team in this road trip romp mccarthy is a worthy successor to john candy  who also had a gift for warming up caricatures with loveable humanity you know melissa mccarthy has arrived in hollywood when you see her receive mediocre material like identity thief and watch her make it funnier than it deserves to be the movie s stretch for happy happy at the end can t wash away the sour taste of all that s come before  watching  identity thief  made me feel bad for jason bateman dismal   lots of things get stolen in  identity thief   but the biggest heist is of the hundred minutes you ll lose forever watching it for a movie that s essentially a gender scrambled version of midnight run  identity thief is an amiable rip off identity thief is a cinematic shart   a huge mess that s no fun to clean up a manic melissa mccarthy does her darndest to save this overly familiar comedy  alas  it isn t enough  identity thief  gets off to a shaky start and never recovers identity thief elicited one giant shrug from me  identity thief is torture porn  we ve been using that term wrong for years an obnoxious and repulsive comedy that consistently wastes the talents of its two charismatic stars if you think about it long enough  you ll realize that the movie is asking you to root for a disturbed sociopath who ruins people s lives for sport  are we having fun yet a sloppy script from craig mazin shows no sense of character  and dragged out direction from seth gordon shows no understanding of comic momentum  for all of its extraneous subplots and contrived scripting  the film s  got one decidedly potent weapon in the form of the fearless dynamo melissa mccarthy if only there were some kind of federal bureau that could handle the investigation of such crimes  everything might be resolved easily and quickly identity thief  is not only not funny  it s negative funny  it s short on laughs  but it will disturb and annoy its stars  jason bateman and melissa mccarthy  steal so many laughs from such improbable places that the bumps in this revenge road trip farce can be mostly forgiven  though not forgotten what a bummer  it  manages to make off with just enough laughs to work  thanks to the wondrous mccarthy  one of the few actresses in hollywood allowed to showcase her wit and charisma as much as her physique an unfunny jumble of absurdities has the kind of cast that makes audiences ask   how bad could it be   before proceeding to answer that very question as is the case with other unsatisfactory diversions  it is entirely possible to ignore the worst parts of this movie  to drift along during the lulls  slide over the half baked jokes and just wait for ms  mccarthy and mr  bateman to do their things this often very mean spirited movie about modern rage plays out with nods to several road trip classics the comedy equivalent of mud wrestling without the mud electronic identity theft offers a host of new possibilities  and to have almost none of them explored by writer craig mazin and director seth gordon in this uninspired trudge of a road movie is the biggest waste of all the darkness in this comedy is exactly what makes it work so well at best it s perversely interesting as a major misstep for both stars just because there is nothing new under the sun doesn t mean mccarthy can t make hay while it shines if nothing else  identity thief confirms mccarthy s identity in the hollywood hierarchy  she s a big  ballsy star unfunny  predictable  and vulgar  it s the generic equivalent of a judd apatow movie  as always  you get what you pay for  identity thief  is not a great movie  but it is a great vehicle for two terrific actors who drape themselves in material perfectly tailored to them identity thief could be mistaken for the latest todd phillips comedy  whether that s an endorsement or a warning depends on your tastes  it s a comedy that s not really much of a comedy  and it forces the audience to sympathize with a monster of a woman  even while she shows no remorse for her awful crimes what success the movie finds is due to the leads  efforts  which are impressively strenuous  they start out with a great premise  and they re clearly ready to run with it  but most of the laughs are stolen right out from under them mccarthy  who has been wackily funny in supporting parts  will be the revelation for most of us  not only can she carry a lead  but she handles heartfelt moments of joy and sorrow the film s few chuckles can be chalked up to the sheer comedic charisma of mccarthy and bateman while  identity thief  isn t one of the best road trip movies to come our way  melissa mccarthy makes the journey worth it if this is the best we can offer two very fine actors  we re in trouble  as an industry and a culture  in other words  melissa mccarthy and jason bateman deserve a lot better  and so do we if  identity thief  isn t the most outrageous social satire since  myra breckenridge   then my name isn t rex reed the result is no classic  but it is fun and it seems to be paving the way for the day when  under the guidance of a smart director  mccarthy knocks one out of the park a disaster  lurching awkwardly from one tone to another  way too long with too many characters  and seriously short on laughs all the while  as outrageous as the premise may seem  there s enough laughs to make up for the predictable road comedy formula we ve seen so many times before i did not know i could yawn angrily  this movie somehow proved it possible much as i like melissa mccarthy  this aimless road movie misfires  and when is hollywood going to let a plus sized woman be not only sexual but erotic ultimately unsatisfying  not as laugh out loud funny as it promises to be in the opening a weak tea reworking of midnight run  itself a long overvalued action comedy that was never as good its proponents would have you think identity thief  is mostly noteworthy for reminding us that mccarthy s talents can  indeed  carry a comedy  it s too bad that it had to be this one gordon is lost  and his style of shooting   telescopic close ups  which never give us enough space to appreciate the performers   feels wrong for comedy a comedy doesn t necessarily need to develop its characters past caricatures  but a better balance between narrative and yuks tends to make the yuks stronger they aimed for  midnight run   settled for attempting  due date   and wound up with  guilt trip it wants to be  midnight run  meets  planes  trains and automobiles   but it carries little of the dramatic heft and real world semi plausibility of those much superior efforts the contrived setup doesn t make much sense  and the movie throws in far too many extraneous antagonists and dead end plot detours  none of which are entertaining asinine  and  illiterate  a cabal of under sketched narrative interlopers  an uncertain mixture of tones and  most damningly  a general lack of good ideas and jokes doom this strained offering melissa mccarthy is riveting in simply penned moments of remorse and confession  adding tearful depth to her ace timing and formidable physical comedy of the many qualities i adore about melissa mccarthy as a comedian and as a dramatic actor  the best is how fully she gives herself to every character she plays another rough comic movie road trip helps give car travel a bad name with identity thief  melissa mccarthy proves she s got what it takes to carry a feature  however meager the underlying material    a comedy that is about two thirds worthy of your money and one third a waste of everybody s time  in other words  better than average for a major studio comedy these days it s a deserving subject that should be explored in a more viable film  but identity thief is so bad it s hard to believe it wasn t directed by judd apatow or the farrelly brothers mccarthy gets bashed about like a stooge  and she bashes back with riotous abandon  sadly  the rest of the movie is a shambles it fails as a star vehicle  a recession era satire  a wtf white collar grunt revenge tale  a midnight run style buddy flick  a gross out laughfest and a bathetic tale of broken souls nanbreathtakingly  beautifully simple whether you consider it a smart thriller or a paint by numbers spy caper  the bourne identity is a dynamic interpretation of robert ludlum s bestselling novel violent but thrilling first of the bourne action trilogy the bourne identity  is a well written action spy film that stays true to its espionage thriller genre while inflicting flinch inducing moments of pure cinematic action a suspenseful thriller that showcases stunning visuals  great acting and a story that will keep you entertained from start to finish this is a long sweet breath of fresh air in the action genre   farfetched plotting nearly capsizes this globe trotting thriller but director doug liman certainly keeps the international intrigue and testosterone flowing at an entertaining clip a first rate thriller with grit and intrigue to spare you may be surprised by the fact that this formula spy thriller has been delivered with a matter of fact efficiency that proves highly entertaining a sleek espionage thriller that reduces the world to the size of a postage stamp  matt damon is terrific the movie is about muscular speed and skill  and that s all it s about  like its hero  it s blank by design for once  a sequel would be welcome    liman is also clever enough to make the real action start when the motor stops plenty of very cool fight scenes  edited such that although they are fast paced  you can actually see what s happening the bourne identity is an intense  violent  bite your nails to the quick thriller one of the many problems  other than damon s lack of emotion  is the fact that there s no suspense also helped immeasurably by an unusually cool score by john powell  mr  liman also makes good use of the european settings  alternating between close ups of damon s frustrated face and wider pans that slurp up the snow clad france setting    puts the snap  crackle and pop back into the spy thriller liman can uncork leap out of your seat shocks  draw out suspense scenes with malicious finesse and even ease a touch of romance and droll humor into the yarn the result is an intriguingly paced thriller that knows how to milk some excitement out of smaller scenes all the style cannot make up for the flagging energy level of the narrative     with its script problems  it s probably better than it should be    typical light summer fare it s a really safe bet that damon will be bourne again the bourne identity is about as effective a thriller as you could want  especially if you don t want to think too hard i suspect i ll watch this movie over and over  it s simply a blast fast  thrilling and everything that james bond no longer is matt damon proves he s more than up to the task as an action star  a new action hero is bourne   as incredibly cheesy and precious that advertising tag line for the bourne identity is  there s no discounting the truth it does hold while it never reaches transcendence of its genre  it happens to be pleasurably overstuffed with smart and welcome touches matt damon s an amnesiac secret agent on the run in this immensely satisfying and engagingly direct thriller in short  the bourne identity is an excellent thriller and is well worth checking out the movie may not be realistic  but it earns its stripes as high class escapist fare the bourne identity is a blockbuster without a point    despite its good looking veneer  its breakneck pace  its daisy chain of expert set pieces  some crucial logic or motive appears to have been junked along the way    a passable effort that receives plenty of mileage out of damon s expectedly engaging performance   the bourne identity delivers everything you ask for in a thriller   nail biting suspense  awe inspiring stunts and a resolution as satisfying as the film itself spry and alive with possibility  but  also dramatically consequential    the first spy thriller in a good while to successfully marry intentions and deeds a fast paced  unpredictable and edgy yarn that breathes new life into the espionage thriller genre now  our world is much more complex  the enemies much more gray  bourne identity is a clear product of that gray area  but somehow still harkens back to the good old days when a spy was still a spy the film may be more of a mess than the inside of bourne s head  but its quirks  strangely enough  are what keep it interesting    great kinetic  silly fun a rollicking adventure yarn aside from turning me away from the cia  this was a good flick the bourne identity is no mere summer amusement park ride  it s as gray as go was colorful and a cool contrast to its source material damon captures the sense of a good man awakening from a nightmare that turns out to have been his actual life twists and turns keep the story increasingly complex and gripping  even if director liman doesn t really pump up the adrenaline a well executed spy thriller an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch aspires to be both a whammo action blockbuster and an intelligent think piece   a delicate balance for any film to pull off provide s  nail biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology of the moment technique or pretentious dialogue great fights  you wouldn t think of damon as a tough guy  but he s worked really hard on the physical stuff here and it shows a film that is at best misguided  at worst stubbornly flashy  garbled and ready to file in the drawer labeled  instantly forgettable  damon brings the proper conviction to his role as  jason bourne  there s rarely a dull moment  but the movie doesn t descend into cartoonish action violence like most action movies do these days   the film fails to explore more intriguing narrative possibilities regarding the psychological effects of its character s identity crisis this teaming  including a brilliant and freshly adaptive cast combines for a most engrossing bit of entertainment that maintains tension and credibility throughout in addition to a clever plot  intrigue  and a car chase or two  matt damon manages to pull off being a friendly face that happens to be a highly trained killer an above average and massively entertaining international thriller the bourne identity does not have much in the way of plot or characters  but it is a better than average guns  gadgets  and chases in interesting locations movie an intelligent  well acted popcorn movie  a little smarter and more sly than most summer offerings while bourne s ultimate identity is not as surprising as we might like  enough fun has been generated in the journey itself who needs an identity when you re having this much fun the bourne identity is much like a jackie chan movie  only with mr  matt damon performing the superman stunts liman fails to use his distinct style to dust off this old sky cranker and making robert rodriguez look like an indie genius with the sky kids series even someone with amnesia would recognize the spy thriller tactics on display here  but at least they re skillfully used it s a smart  solid  kinetically charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn  nothing overly original  mind you  but solidly entertaining really well done if liman s ambition is to leave ifc to make big hollywood entertainment vehicles  then i would suggest he rent the entire tony scott library a great handbook on how to cop ideas from the best spy  action  adventure flicksthe action scenes are generally pulse pounding and gritty  the problem is that they don t build to anything liman is a surprisingly good action director  making even the most routine spectacle seem a little more interesting than it probably should beit moves quickly  adroitly  and without fuss  it doesn t give you time to reflect on the inanity    and the cold war datedness    of its premise i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again  but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible awfully disappointing coming from the director of swingers and go kudos to director doug liman for injecting textbook spy fare with slick intelligence and a truckload of tension     a savory sip of cognac in a pabst blue ribbon summer of overbaked fantasy franchises and witless popcorn thrillers the climax lacks the punch and satisfaction it could have delivered in a true clash of the titans like its protagonist  it never hands you explanations on a silver platter  and it makes you think a bit  something far too few thrillers do these days i could sympathize with damon s character suffering from memory loss  as i too couldn t recall much about this forgettable film soon after seeing it nicely paced and fits the bill for those in search of two hours of spy based action and martial arts you need more than generic flash  dash and martial arts moves to make a memorable thriller  or do you an engaging action thriller painted against some of europe s most beautiful locales a very familiar story  but well craftedas the genre goes  it can be entertaining  but the bourne identity as a whole can t live up to the sum of its parts or its very weak ending the bourne identity is an intriguing and action packed spy thriller  it lacks a big payoff at the end  but is otherwise entertaining i am giving the bourne identity a marginal nod  but if you re looking for a classic style espionage yarn with complex characters and an engrossing  complicated story  rent spy game instead state of the art hollywood genre filmmaking  impersonal  efficient and exciting does the bourne identity hang together as a taut spy thriller  not completely  but matt certainly delivers a summer punch there isn t a dull or dumb moment in this movie an entertaining thriller that eschews most of the usual spy gimmicks in favour of old fashioned sleuthing the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper s agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac  we don t feel much for damon bourne or his predicament bourne aspires only to be a fun popcorn movie    and  for the most part  it is its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar  but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy movie charm and  at the same time  is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time for the most part  it thankfully succeeds rather well and comes off as an engaging and entertaining entry in the genre there are moments that feel just on the edge of silly  but that s the idea the swiftest and sexiest modern thriller since the thomas crown affair a thriller with some brains and feeling behind it  more attuned to story and character than to spectacle like a lot of fast paced spy films  the bourne identity seldom pauses for character development  fortunately  there s just enough to pull us into the saga  thanks largely to damon and potente the bourne identity has all the necessary components of the genre  and deploys them well the bourne identity is always lucid and rarely boring    after bad company  it seems particularly expert liman  of swingers and go  makes his big budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long  low heat chase  interrupted by a middling car chase the bourne identity isn t a bad movie so much as one that feels like an amateur version of material from more accomplished works it wouldn t be measurable in g forces  but there is enough forward motion in the bourne identity to pin audiences backwards and enough nervous tension to put them on the edge a thriller that actually lives up to its trailer as the intended start of a franchise  the bourne identity is a bit of a bust the film consists mostly of action and romance  two things liman does well in his comedies  but rather poorly here the bourne identity is a firm foundation for an espionage film franchise that could very well decommission fleming s bond or tom clancy s jack ryan the bourne identity shouldn t be half as entertaining as it is  but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood doug liman has come up with a really fun piece of eye candy and that s as much as one should hope for in a summer shoot em up although the exposition effectively invokes cool  the gradual warming trend finally gives this film a resonance beyond immediate impact if the bourne identity is an example of indie movie rogue agents gone amok  then mainstream hollywood should definitely recruit a few more overall  liman has done a good job of making this old cold war thriller seem born again the bourne identity crackles with equal measures of efficiency and energy as a psychological study of secret agents  the bourne identity is too much carnival ride and not enough john le carre the bourne identity  starring matt damon  is a blast from the past dressed up as current day fare  but this retro thriller still packs a powerful punch identity is one of those rare thrillers where the cops aren t fools  villains don t turn stupid at crucial moments  and career assassins seldom miss targets for all its shoot outs  fistfights  and car chases  this movie is a phlegmatic bore  so tedious it makes the silly spy vs  spy film the sum of all fears  starring ben affleck  seem downright hitchcockian as if trying to grab a lump of play doh  the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story  the more details slip out between his fingers some say this movie lacks character development   but i d like to know exactly how you develop a character who doesn t know who he is with his stilted performance  damon manages to make bourne about the dullest spy who ever lived the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups not nearly so serious or smug as most spy movies  it affects and celebrates a kind of offbeatness that s rare in the genre even without web shooters or a light saber  damon comes out as one of the good guys of summer liman adds some brash  and occasionally subtle  touches to the spy on the run formula  without ever quite managing to transcend the cliches though it s clearly meant to be character driven  the movie is thrown out of whack by a total lack of chemistry between the leads  and some great acting on the side laced with great shock moments  bourne moves along smartly on its own steam  drawing us confidently into its orbit as much as i adore the bond franchise  i can t say i ve ever been as giddy over one of those films as i am with the bourne identity free from the encumbrances of history and of ludlum s cloddish prose  the bourne identity  like its hero  triumphs through sheer unreflective professionalism doug liman  the director of bourne  directs the traffic well  gets a nice wintry look from his locations  absorbs us with the movie s spycraft and uses damon s ability to be focused and sincere anyone familiar with the better work of damon or director doug liman will see their jacked up expectations shot down sets medium range goals for itself  and nails them solidly the meandering and sloppy finale only makes it even more ironically forgettable there s a new action hero in town  and i m sorry yoda  but he isn t a cgi midget with bad hygiene and miss piggy s voice confirms that espionage can be compelling without being sexy  even with matt damon in the starring role a captivating spy thriller well worth the ticket price a composition of gestures stripped of romance and presented in their barest forms the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him       there is never really a true  us  versus  them  the bourne identity  creates its own new coherence of indie arthouse and commercial thriller  i ve seen the best cloak and danger exercises  including the spy who came in from the cold and the original day of the jackal  and in terms of story and cold sweat suspense  i d rank this one right up there even if the new bourne identity doesn t stick to the letter of his work  the late  great ludlum would still appreciate this ripping yarn if he saw it a transcendent summer movie  it assumes  for two hours  you ve brain and heart enough to stick with a film that doesn t condescend  doesn t beat you up and doesn t dumb you to death a throwback to all that made movies like this exciting in the first place  a film where the action  though highly alluring  remains less important than the mystery at hand an impeccable hollywood thriller the film s greatest asset is how much it s not just another connect the dots  spy on the run picture exciting and engrossing   doesn t attempt anything innovative  but it succeeds by doing the tried and true very effectively the film s overall upbeat tempo and eventful complications made for an entertaining watch a close to solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late my main concern upon hearing of this project was  will i believe that matt damon could kill me with a business card at fifty yards  fortunately the answer is a resounding yes    with  the bourne identity  we return to the more traditional action genre the slickest  coolest assassin flick since  the professional a taut  fast action thriller  but matt damon just doesn t cut it as a spy there s nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that s packed with just as much intelligence as action it has the reeled in pyrotechnics and the muted pacing of an intelligent spy film  but it doesn t have the smarts of one a completely satisfying thriller that will keep your brain engaged and your adrenaline pumping old fashioned in the best sense of the term  an espionage tale that rejects the gaudiness and glamor of the recent james bond epics and concentrates instead on a fairly straightforward manhunt mystery liman does such a superb job with the pacing of the film that you almost forget about how little substance there is a beneficiary of lowered standards  the film may be a bloodless piece of thriller craftsmanship  but at a time when craft has become a negligible quality  its streamlined efficiency and whipcrack timing are increasingly uncommon virtues while there s never a dull moment  the film  derived from a robert ludlum novel  is too mechanical and plot driven to veer very far into character it may not work as a full fledged spy thriller or as an identity crisis pot boiler yet  thanks to liman s near effortless direction  the genre gumbo is top notch nonetheless what is exciting prose on the printed page becomes merely prosaic on the big screen in these dog days  bourne earns what passes as high praise  it doesn t suck the bourne identity is a quality film that works and it fulfills many of the cinematic wishes that critics and audiences regularly complain are not being fulfilled by studio films sneak review  i was very disapointed with the rough cut  it unfortunately succumbed to the demise of many movie problems  too many plot holes and unanswered questions a strictly for the kiddies  enjoy it in the moment  forget it when it s over popcorn flick  what makes it such a disappointment is that  the world s greatest comics magazine  deserved better aided by largely credible special effects  the four stars of fantastic four manage to make their movie worth seeing and give us reason to be optimistic for a more cohesive sequel fantastic four is anything but  and should serve as an indication that maybe its time to put the brakes on the current avalanche of comic book adaptations lee and kirby built marvel comics on the foundation of the ff and it s no stretch to say this franchise could still be going strong a decade later with a better opening act  fantastic four is terribly miscast  it s poorly written  visually uninteresting  and worst of all  boring  the film drags considerably  there are huge gaps without any action and it brings the pacing to an unbearable crawl fantastic four is actually very true to its source material   often literally so   but generally misses the spirit entirely some comics just shouldn t be turned in to movies   the film is made in the internet equivalent of capital letters and its simplistic morality stands out on the big screen more so than on the small page an opportunity squandered by marvel  which really needs to watch its quality control more closely four play without any climax the film is affable enough  though nothing much seems to be at stake after the recent crop of enjoyable superhero movies  this is just an embarassment a better than average comic book effort tim story gives the marvel comics superheroes the barbershop treatment shows how filmmaking through market research  screenwriting by committee  and over dependence on moviemaking technology can result in huge  colourful  loud but totally vacuous and heartless movies marvel comics continues to empty out its stable of superheroes with this entertaining tale full review in greeknot all comic book films have to be as weighty and angst filled as a graphic novel  fantastic four is neither fantastic nor incredible  but it s entertaining nonetheless fantastic it most certainly ain t    there is little sense of wonder or excitement in fantastic four  it is merely a middling contender among a surplus of superhero movies when the playboy  joke around character is the best part of the film  you know you have problems not all that exciting to watch  let me tell you a garish mediocrity never goes deeper than the ink on a comic bookif the equally naive superman were released today  would it receive a similarly cold reception  a part from some undeniably slick effects     the wow factor in this movie is surprisingly minute      o nly julian mcmahon s nefarious psycho  dr  doom  shows real promise here director tim story manages to give it no character whatever  with the casting making things worse let s hope the follow ups turn out to be better    they could hardly be worse not a great film but a good opening chapter    a film about a superhero family that s actually a family friendly superhero film the ff are unpretentious and nerdy and they bicker with each other  giving the film a loose  buoyant quality in between action sequences no disgrace  but it s far from a classic either it puts a smile on your face and you can t resist the charming nature of the film the only story you ll find in fantastic four is the one attached to the last name of its director the protagonists of this film certainly deserved a better fate fantastic four is a popcorn movie that delivers a fluffy  buttery treatafter this lackluster outing  the thought of a sequel is a stretch even mr  fantastic might not be able to make a fantastic bore a fantastic bore  foursome marred by lousy writing and directingthe result is hardly fantastic  but it is quite a lot of fun tim story    who  based on his previous work in the small scale barbershop and the painfully poor taxi  was clearly the wrong man for this job on its own terms  fantastic four is a pretty lousy movie  but it looks even worse coming on the heels of so many recent first rate comic book adaptations with a sort of backdoor approach to superherodom  another comic strip from the minds of stan lee and jack kirby hits the celluloid a fairly dull  thoroughly mediocre adventure  hardly the cinematic treatment marvel s first family deserves ten years in the making  and this is all we get tim story s screen adaptation of the marvel comic is cheesy in production values  it s the clash of personalities that makes the film in any way fantastic the feature is neither disappointing  nor memorable  it is just average  which is something a superhero or band of heroes cannot be an obnoxious movie in which potential adventure is sideswiped in favor of watery characters and dialogue that feels like it was lifted from five or six reality shows fantastic four functions at the level of a below average saturday morning cartoon there are four different movies in the fantastic four struggling to get out    another comic book movie with a lot of special effects     a complete waste of time  too insipid to live despite a good cast  this is a badly made film that only barely works as brainless filler it s not particularly fantastic  but fantastic four is passable summer popcorn fare unlike most recent comic book adaptations  fantastic four doesn t think it s about anything  in fact  it s doubtful that the film thinks  period  superheroes are only as good as the supervillain  so let s get these forces clashing early on and often if exposure to cosmic rays made all women look like jessica alba  then every lifetime movie should glow green  fantastic four is left passing off dopey comedy and performances as playfulness weighted down with a turgid story and utterly middling special effects  the fantastic four isn t likely to be stan lee s favorite of the nearly dozen marvel comics adaptations either out already or on their way if i were to put the same amount of effort into my review that the folks behind fantastic four expended trying to entertain you  the rest of this page would be blank before the inevitable and surprisingly anticlimactic battle with doom  we are treated to two extreme sports demonstrations  several training montages   and  an ill advised love triangle we know what comic book movies are capable of being  they can have greatness in them  fantastic four has nothing more than okay ness fantastic four is a special effects extravaganza  but its plot is mired in issues that only schoolboys care about after such recent downers as  war of the worlds  and  dark water   this campy film version of marvel s longest running comic book series is a breath of fresh air now  i m not saying director tim story was the wrong choice but when the only two things of note on your resume are the moderately amusing barbershop and the horrendous taxi there just has to be a better way to go a lousy excuse for a big budget action film  the perfect summertime movie  munch your popcorn and let your senses absorb all the fantastic fun bland performances throughout  and really  who wants to make jessica alba the invisible girl  what a bad idea  i want her to be visible at all times a lack of pretense shouldn t mean a lack of wit or excitement   far less than fantastic one wonders if an added character named sleeperman would consider joining the crew because then this simplistic sci fi dud could have been dubbed as fantastic snoreit s kind of incredible how little happens in this movie metza metza  the ff is just not that fantastic t all   as marvel comics fans already know  being zapped by a radioactive cloud in outer space alters your dna according to your sense of self lacking any coherent vision  of all the recent movies derived from comic books  this is among the weakest it s certainly an adequate summer popcorn movie chiklis breathes fresh life into perhaps the silliest comic book character adapted for the big screen with a genuine humanity that can be felt even through the bulky foam costume the best of the comic book movies in recent years have demonstrated that thrills and spectacle don t have to be strangers to wit and grace reducing a summer blockbuster to the scale of a primetime sitcom is novel  but it isn t admirable the key to the success of marvel comics adaptations is that even as the characters have fantastic powers  they remain ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances michael chiklis won t have to put on that uncomfortable thing outfit again a fun  fast and fantastically performed movie  and a pretty good interpretation of the comicit might help if alba could act  though i doubt her horny legion of fans will complain  l ike a kiddie ride when i ve been primed to expect the biggest  baddest  meanest emotional roller coaster of a sexy action movie when it s all about guys in tights    begins to feel like it comes from the one comic book even a comic book geek would be embarrassed to be caught reading it exists largely to entertain and delight  which used to be precisely what summer blockbusters were engineered to do as total packaging  you can t deny that this show is handsomely wrapped it s done with an agreeable confidence and flair  the actors all fit comfortably in their roles and the effects are fun fantastic four falters most in its cynical approach  obviously gearing for a sequel  the movie goes heavy on development and light on action if there was ever any doubt that action scenes depend more on context than flash  fantastic four proves it right from the start the movie smells like a stinker because of its z grade casting  worst of all is julian mcmahon  overacting as a kevin spacy ish dr  doom not the best movie of the summer  but it may the best accompaniment to popcorn devotes as much time to a creaky love triangle as it does exploring the fantastic powers of its foursome  and that begs the question  who goes to a movie like this looking for what is essentially a bad episode of dawson s creek a human rubber band  a transparent woman  a guy on fire  a walking rock pile  and a guy named doom seem perfectly plausible in the funny books on the big screen  not so much even if you can get past the acting    and in the case of the beautiful  blank alba  that s asking a lot    the film just sits there  not exactly torturous  but never very exciting  either how about the okay quartet the fantastic four get treated reverently  but not seriously  in this modified retelling of the story  but then it s hard to take any one seriously who goes to work for dr  victor von doom and doom industries when the four finally use their different powers together to fight doctor doom  it s enough to get you past the torpor of origin movie syndrome and make you hope for a sequel that gets right down to business superheroes  origin stories are inherently background heavy  but director tim story and screenwriters simon kinberg  michael france and mark frost spend too much time on setup a funky  fun film version of the famous marvel superhero concoction a wildly uneven  sporadically slapdash action adventure that amuses in fits and starts fantastic it ain t  but not bad it sort of is it s better than the roger corman version  but that s not saying much the film generates little tension or excitement  dawdling its way towards the climactic showdown between the heroes and the villain  doctor doom a movie that never delivers on its premise  a movie that takes promising character dynamics and gullet stuffs them with idiot dialogue  a movie that will alienate all but the wee and easily impressed with its frequent lurches into stupidity a popcorn popper  a cinematic sugar buzz  and blessedly so the comic book adventure is a fun  escapist change of pace from all the politically weighted popcorn fare on the scene this season    too bouncy to be an elektra bummer  but should make marvel mascot stan lee think twice about burning another lucrative bridge with unintentional hilarity a perfect storm of wooden acting  hackneyed direction  inane scripting and laughably cartoonish special effects produces a shapeless mess more wearyingly stupid than arch villian dr  doom is evil you don t expect realism from a comic book movie  but you do want the characters to seem larger than life  here  they look like contestants at a costume party by being late to the multiplex marketplace  the film version offers little we haven t seen done before and done better not a bad movie  but it is a film likely to alienate the fan base of the comic book on which it is based  the writers are  so busy setting up the premise that they barely get around to exploiting it story can t infuse this juvenile hunk of entertainment with either the wit or the savvy to make it seem like anything more than an overblown version of saturday  morning tv the kind of don t ask  too many questions action hero movie where the humor is tasty and the fx are wicked cool a film that s nowhere near as fantastic as it should be  something s missing  and that something is most likely a strong director a not so bad mindless bit of camp escapism that doesn t try to eclipse its dime store comic book roots it s sporadically entertaining but never amounts to more than mediocre four a bad superhero comedy that takes its time going nowhere their trip into space may be another small step for man  but it s a giant leap backward for the comic book turned action movie genre can be fun if your expectations are low enough i guess  commonplace four  or  tedious four  didn t have the same ring to it fantastic four never strives to be  fantastic   it works as a human story and succeeds due to dimished expectations set by a horrible marketing campaign fantastic four is anything but  and should serve as an indication that maybe its time to put the brakes on the current avalanche of comic book adaptations its plot is stretched thin  its creativity is nearly invisible  its logic is rocky  and the whole enterprise goes up in flames a more accurate title would have been  the fantastic two and the other two  not so much there was nothing that i could point to and say   that was stupid   considering the atomic wasteland of superhero properties committed to film  that s saying a lot about as dynamic as teddy ruxpin    in its willingness to go for cheap jokes and awful schwarzenegger style wisecracks   fantastic  is reminiscent of  batman and robin    a colorful  young skewing flick    but one as hopelessly bland as it is behind the times the new fantastic four might have been palatable if we hadn t already met a certain wall crawler or caped crusader on screen fantastic four is what it is  and i m okay with what it is the good news is that this fantastic four film manages to capture a lot of what made the comics appealing  the bad news is that the final product isn t quite as good as it could have been the film is entertaining and moves along at a good clip  but when you reach the anticlimactic ending  you realize that nothing really happened  and that for every cool scene there was a badly directed one very smooth  if overly familiar in trying to nail just the right mix of comic book action  comedy and pathos  the movie emerges as a tone deaf mishmash of underdeveloped characters  half baked humor and unhatched plotting drenched in cgi overkill had the filmmakers deliberately set out to insult  demean  and trample upon lee and kirby s legacy  they could hardly have done a more efficient job so much   is bungled with inept storytelling and watered down dialogue  and story is so powerless to right the course  that fantastic four winds up more dopey than fun all talk  no action superhero flick is a dull  drab mess of shallow plots  dull characters and bland effects everything about it bears the stench of amateurs  from the unspectacular special effects to the sitcom lame dialogue to the butchered storyline no doubt roger corman s version was worse  but it was probably more entertaining the most endearing terms i might come up with for this film are  dorky  and  cute   but  cute  is never what a superhero movie aspires to be a painful  sluggish black hole of simultaneous bad ideas and no ideas at all a not great movie made slightly better by the addition of some extra character development and breathing room  the fantastic four extended edition is a must own for fans of the original comic book the happiest comic book movie on earth    by now the only way to give us something different is to show people who enjoy being superheroes meet mr  mediocrity  the human kindling  the obscure woman and whatchamacallit  they form the mediocre four and boast the power to slightly entertain and somewhat enthrall almost fantastically bad poor ben grimm suffers the most tragic fate  he is transformed from the charismatic  brilliant actor michael chiklis into a giant prosthetic goofy suit that fools no one aficionados of the comic book will cringe    but hey  it s a fun popcorn flick oh yes  it s catwoman bad low indeed have marvel s fortunes sunk when this is the best they can send against their archrival s superior batman begins whole chunks of necessary explanation feel like they ve been left on the cutting room floorpotential audiences would be better entertained by reading all the reviews to see how many synonyms can be used for the word  bad   and it would be much cheaper  too an overinflated b movie with no grace  no subtext  no wit  and featuring beefcake cheesecake actors who look like they ve been plucked from the soaps there s nothing terribly fantastic about this ho hum futuristic foray  fantastic four  could have been hot  but in the hands of some studio blockheads  the premise is stretched so thin that it disappears rarely terrible  let alone memorable  it s a brutally average piece of disposable summer entertainment that fades from the mind like some hazy  half sleeping dream more superhero sitcom than comic book adventure  the movie lacks a strong  dramatic through line if you want to see how members of a family that s fraught with discord and dysfunction learn about teamwork and the nature of kin    and dispatch bad guys in the process    rent the incredibles compared with the psychological probing and spiritual brooding of batman begins  fantastic four is proudly dumb  loud and inconsequential the radiation altered members of the fantastic four don t show their humanity  rather  the superpowered quartet is little more than a bland collection of four color caricatures the whole thing lacks oomph and identity it certainly looks stunning  and there s even a try at injecting some human drama and strong emotion into the action stew it s fun to watch superheroes who aren t quite at ease with their abilities  but the incredibles    last year s similarly themed animated film    is livelier and funnier you can feel the flopsweat of the screenwriters  laboring to make their jokes work and their scenes interesting what could have been the brilliant set up to an ongoing franchise is instead turned into a vacuous slice of summer escapism it s hard to tell if the other actors are awful or if it s the script could have been dumb fun   unfortunately  the filmmakers succeed in getting only the dumb part right  omitting the fun entirely at their best  the results have a comic zip that the x men pictures have largely lacked take the movie on its own lighthearted terms and  chances are  you ll be taken in sad  then  to see that the marvel rag that elevated the human element in the pow biff bam of the superhero world has been transposed into the most plastic of comic to movie adaptations yet fantastic four is essentially campy fun  this is the sort of movie schumacher s batman and robin was trying to be fantastic four isn t even close to sin city  batman begins or even constantine  but it s a relatively quick  vibrant  focused origin story  so bad it takes points away from batman begins fantastic flopthis movie is more like a b grade comic book adaptation than the a list production it should have been fantastic four  for all of its super effects and glossy finish  is a hollow movie experience a wasted opportunity to breathe fresh life into the marvel universe s long stodgy elder statesmen  yes  it s kinda stupid  but it s basically fun a movie about depressed superheroes trying to become unsuper is as boring as it sounds fantastic four is a movie that could have been a lot better   but it could also have been a lot worse who are these half wit hollywood clowns that keep hiring cleavage candy actresses with no measurable talent to play laughably bespectacled scientists in action movies how fascinating that a film about super humans was made by a collection of sub humans  what a topsy turvy world in which we live none of it s any more impressive than the stuff you can find in your average video game sometimes the hollywood treatment can be a superhero s greatest arch nemesis nannannannanseinfeld s dry delivery makes for a certain adult sensibility  but even the horde of celebrity cameos can t really lift the story off the ground here s the final buzz  bee movie deserves to be queen bee at the box office its moral that even the smallest creature can make a world of difference is one to be appreciated  it is a shame  however  that it could not keep up its energetic and fun pace established within its first act  the hyperactive comic randomness is deadeninga consistently amusing bit of animated whimsy from funnyman jerry seinfeld that has the observational comic s fingerprints all over it has there ever been an uglier animated feature  the eerie  fever dream like faux three dimensionality  the cyborg like humanoids  the septic  etiolated colors personally  i think i liked  nothing  better     may not be  about nothing   but it is not about much more than the puny pun in the title    tries mightily to be cute and cuddly  and in this regard it succeeds   at least for kids seinfeld s pleasingly idiosyncratic comic voice comes through in the haphazard  slaphappy storyline   blu ray  t his comedy provides sporadic chuckles but  you ll pardon the expression  drones on for much of its running time bland  watered down seinfeld ian humor for kids  amusing at best  grating at worst relentlessly uneven yet basically entertaining   without a particularly strong storyline and loaded with only modestly enjoyable gags  it putts along like a familiar old jalopy  reasonably likeable if eminently forgettable bee movie is a solid mix of comforting gags  clever language and a meandering plot that doesn t seem to have enough gas to stretch out into a full feature bee boundaries are so last year and fans are likely to understand it in seinfeldian hysterical terms  to the rest of us it s an overstretched been there  seen that concept decade old leftovers reaching for laughs i can t believe i m going to say it  but this film is as busy as a bee dreamworks animation is not pixar  no matter how hard it tries  dreamworks  animated films lack the sort of effortless charm  animated grace and satirical wit that pixar seems to generate instinctively bee movie is a light  moderately entertaining romp  not that there s anything wrong with that what distinguishes this better than half decent comedy is its detailed insight into the bee brainseinfeld the professional cynic has become seinfeld the environmental crusader  who d have thunk it bee sure to see this this curiously flat animated comedy simply doesn t have the sparkle one expects from a jerry seinfeld project cleverly acted and beautifully rendered   bee movie  is another animated triumph from the studio that brought us  shrek amusing and likeable  but scarcely memorable the best we can award is bee minus what a treat to see a comedy that starts funny  is funny in the middle  and ends funny   unlike the usual hollywood model in which all the humour is used up in the first act setting up the premise  and then winds down into sentimentality sadly the animation fails to bee dazzle   often looking a bit flat  overall  it has to be a bee plus this dreamworks film is not the sliced bread marvel it has spent an enormous amount of money pretending to be  but it must be said that seinfeld s script is a thing of wonder the animation is fine  the plot accessible enough for youngsters and it clocks in at a snappy hour and a half bright  sunny and almost instantly forgettable  even jerry seinfeld can t stop bee movie from boldly going where far too many cgi animations have gone before whatever happened to no hugs  no learning  it s enough to bring you out in hives passes the time  but undoutedly one for the little  uns bee movie has its moments but all in all there is very little sting in its tale the depth of talent in the cast and gag writing shines through  but it s only just enough to take your mind off of the flat animation amusing comedy with likeable characters  colourful animation and several great gags  though the script isn t as focussed as it should have been what bee movie really lacks is a compelling hero  seinfeld is essentially playing himself  so what we get is a stand up comedian in a black and yellow sweater great funi was thoroughly entertained in this lively burst of nonsense that has little agenda except to amusesmarter than it is funny with delicious design enjoyable fun even if it s not particularly original bee movie  has a little bit of something for everyone  it s loaded with action and sight gags for the kids and enough adult humor to keep the grownups happy while most animated features  even the bad ones  champion individuality  bee movie flies in the opposite direction by rallying around the notions of conformity and subservience the weak storyline hovers over a scene while foraging for material and then flits off to a new situation  without a strong narrative  the movie tends to drone on it s impersonal  it doesn t come from anywhere interesting will small children even care about what bees do  all they care about is not getting stung a friendly  joke stuffed animated feature a desperate  unfocused collection of bits and schtick that sends you out of the theater exhausted and unsatisfied as its potential trans species romance can never be consummated  the movie turns instead into a peculiarly balanced relationship comprised of financial and legal accord maybe it would have been better for seinfeld to make an animated movie about nothing seinfeld  what happened  you ve gone soft on us  sure  some of it is fun but where s the sting bee movie is never an unpleasant experience  but it s never a particularly engaging or funny film either seinfeld s sardonic wit is as sharp and irresistible as ever   the big monster in this movie isn t the human race  but those humans who failed to make a compelling film a giddy  freewheeling  clever  delightful animated romp  about nothing   a thing onto itself  the very definition of existential phenomenon seinfeld s quick wit and glib personality are strong enough to give the scattershot story an illusion of coherence compare this to the output of a studio like pixar  and the movie really fits its title  a second rate computer animated comedy too confusing to be humorous rock has but two scenes in the film  but he needs a hundred more  give the man his own movie  please  if only because it d bee far better than this one this is a beautifully animated  cleverly executed  warm and funny adventure beyond its basic concept  bee movie hasn t the first idea where to go regardless of its pg rating  if you are a fan of jerry seinfeld s comedy style  then you will probably find a lot to like here  this is an incredibly witty film a spelling bee  a busy bee  a killer bee  but a seinfeld bee  sorry jerry  your hapless honey seeking hero doesn t create much of an animated buzz i liked bee movie because it was cute  funny  family friendly  and mercifully brief there will be more gags and puns in the reviews of press pundits than could be found in the entirety of this film  which fails to create a bee world of any logic or surprise seinfeld s droll  witty observations add to the adult appeal of  bee movie   and youngsters will probably enjoy its eye popping colors all in all  bee movie s large team of writers and directors scrape together enough for kids to enjoy  but kids these days have come to expect more than just  enough  from their animated movies harmless fun for the whole family a snazzy looking mixed bag  kids will be diverted  adults will tolerate it  and all involved will be expecting something more imaginative than what jerry seinfeld has whittled together it s still the dreamworks model of big  recognizable voices playing their personas  but this time it s an actual movie too  they wait a while to unload all the major pop culture references bee movie is fun  if not formulaic in its humor and story approach  the writers threw in every     bee joke and situation you could think of  yet the movie still works this well meaning but comically limp offering from dreamworks animation inspires boredom more than anything bee movie is a cute movie  not that there s anything     well  you know the rest  but cute is not what adults expect from jerry seinfeld  although children will be delighted bee movie doesn t touch the bar raised so high by pixar  but it creates a little buzz of its own bee movie has a few charming moments and a scene or two with legitimate hilarity  but mostly it s just mediocre some humor in bee movie is too sophisticated for little kids  but there are enough dazzling action scenes to compensate  youngsters won t get an allusion to the graduate  but they ll enjoy the slapstick that follows the film is undistinguished visually  worse  it isn t especially funny what i like about bee movie is its comfy  off the cuff charm  unlike a lot of animated family entertainment  it s not all thwack smash kaboom the movie has some pretty pictures and a few good jokes  but not nearly enough  and the story suffers from sitcom attention deficit disorder  veering off in a new direction every half hour or so watching this pun filled cartoon is like falling into a tray of children s watercolors    the warm end  where oranges and yellows and ambers wave a surprisingly unfunny  belabored and unimaginative comedy  bee movie is a huge disappointment considering the extent of seinfeld s participation nothing about the movie resonates emotionally jerry seinfeld s comic sensibility enlivens this tale of a bee who wants to fly by the seat of his pants seinfeld doesn t need to go back to his  show about nothing  premise  but here s hoping his next project can be about just a little less a kid film with not enough going on is it as bold as it might be  does it blaze with invention  is it the best babbling bee urban biopic  bar none  just about everybody s least favorite hive workers get an anthropomorphic makeover  courtesy of jerry seinfeld  in this animated flick that s got some stinging wit but a story that s strictly for the birds it leaves no unpleasant aftertaste  if you take impressionable kids  you should be prepared to explain two things  no  bees and humans do not normally live happily ever after  and yes  bees sometimes just sting you for the hell of it the film s charm  quickness and design carry the day a welcome diversion from dreamworks animation s increasingly trying shrek series the vibe is loose limbed and fluky  and the gags have an extra snap that s recognizably seinfeldian  if i believed in a sitcom afterlife  i d swear the whole thing was cooked up by kramer and george s dad genuine silliness is so rare a quality these days that it shouldn t go undervalued  even in a sweet little nothing of a picture like bee movie the whole thing s pretty cute and breezy all of this material  written by seinfeld and writers associated with his television series  tries hard  but never really takes off what a pleasure  after a cackle of serious dramas and actual letter grade b movies  this silly insect film was just the ticket to put a little honey in my tea an agreeable though tame animated picture that more than does the trick but is unlikely to become a super buzz flick i got antsy in the bee movie indeed  bee moive is full of half thought through notions  much is at first made of barry s  romance  with a human  voiced by renee zellweger  but any potential problems in the friendship are dropped without discussion midway through not only are the bees nonsensical  so is the plot  even grading on the fantasy curve jerry seinfeld s disappointing labor of animated movie love is more of a lukewarm handholding experience than a full embrace this movie literally just sits there going from scene to scene with a lackadaisical whimsy that  after a while  becomes a bit tedious seinfeld s animated feature flies a little too fast to leave a lasting impression call it the curse of high expectations but with jerry seinfeld involved  laughs should flow like honey but they don t   unless you re really into bee puns bee movie will make you think twice before swatting one of the yellow and black guys next time you re being buzzed here s the biggest problem most folks will have with bee movie  it s not ratatouille one of the better animated films of the year  an enjoyable and consistently clever ride courtesy of the very original comic viewpoint of the man who made arguably the best sitcom of all time kids should get a kick out of it  but anyone craving seinfeld s usual brand of funny business will have to stick to tv reruns while never as clever as it thinks it is  and lacking the internal logic that makes a pixar project hum with indescribable brilliance  bee movie is still a witty  imaginative romp unless your idea of wit is an unrelenting stream of groan inducing insect puns   bee movie  offers little more than buzzkill another ground breaking show about nothing    a hornet s nest of hype for a fat hive of nothing not nearly as funny  clever or witty as one would have hoped it has enough buzzing wit and eye popping animation to win over the kids    and probably more than a few parents  too certainly bee movie could ve been smarter  faster  and far cleverer  and it s disappointing to watch seinfeld settle for less  for a man who made a mint reveling in comedic risk on a weekly basis  his first movie lacks serious sting begins warily as a mild chucker and then reveals itself to be an increasingly clever and very funny appreciation of a bee s existence instead of gently skewering the conventions of contemporary animation  it simply follows them to a tbet you re just itching to see  bee movie  this little honey was launched with an ad campaign possibly equal to the cost of launching a space shuttle     bees have been everywhere made for kids with more bee puns than carrot top and kenny bania could ever imaginebee movie isn t a b movie  it s a z movie  as in dizmal bee movie is certainly not low budget  but it has all the staying power and creative value of a b movie  the secret life of bees  as told by seinfeld  is a bore with a capital b the most genuinely apian aspect of bee movie is that it spends a lot of its running time buzzing happily around  sniffing out fresh jokes wherever they may bloom jerry seinfeld returns to the mainstream spotlight with bee movie  which proves as awkward and ineffective as george costanza s attempts to wear a toupee mostly amusing and good natured  occasionally hysterical  and actually manages to sneak in a subtle lesson about nature it s not worth seeing  but if all the hype has you expecting a classic  you should lower your expectations seinfeld s observational humor is relegated to the edges of a lightweight story the riskiest move seinfeld made was to create an unlikable protagonist who is wrong every step of the way  but treat him like a hero never funny  never meaningful  never coherent  never animated it s a minor film  it ll be amusing once and then forgotten if it s not toy story  well  what is  but bee movie offers plenty of entertainment for all ages    though  truth be told  the older the better bee movie is best viewed as an oddball career move rather than as a successful movie this digitally animated feature is not a great movie  but it is colorful  imaginative and solid entertainment  in many respects  it s more educational and more exciting than it is laugh out loud funny does bee survive the hype  not quite  but it is semi charming and reasonably clever in that facile dreamworks animation kind of way seinfeld comedy is cute fun for the whole family bee movie isn t the second coming of seinfeld  but there s just enough of his singular personality to engage fans and enough buzzy action to delight the holiday kid audience pleasant but entirely forgettable bee movie feels phoned in on every level at its relaxed best  when it s about  well  nothing  the slyly comic bee movie is truly beguiling it s on the easygoing level of surf s up  and a full tick up from  say  over the hedge or the ant bully  but given the seinfeld pedigree it s something of a disappointment an often inspired smart comedy for kids  and a vintage seinfeld laugh for adults it s one of the better animated movies of the year  admittedly  rising to the top of a shallow pool isn t quite as funny as the swarm   neither frisky nor imaginative enough to merit even its short ninety minute running time the mock outrage and dry sarcasm of seinfeld s comic persona defines the movie s hero  a worker bee with a high pitched  often cracking whine you might have been able to get away with stuff like this in the pre pixar age  not anymore yet another animated flick with a starry cast in which a creature that ordinarily would seem pesky is rendered as not just harmless but even lovable and idiosyncratically human  enough already infectiously amusing  more often than not after shrek the third s flatulence jokes  the return of that seinfeldian wit brings animation up a level on the whole  this is another disappointing animated effort and it resides considerably lower on the totem pole than this year s current non live action champion  ratatouille the film is nutty  ecological  antically funny  and moving  all at the same time seinfeld has completely dumbed down his normal clever wit in order to appeal to younger kids  they re probably the only ones who might enjoy this it s bee buzzingly silly if only every bee were named  chris rock  the movie would have the stinging humor it sorely lacks unfortunately  bees just aren t that funny amiable but no more nannannannannani was convinced i was going to hate this film  but  it didn t bug me as much as i thought it would i think it should be considered child abuse to inflict this tripe upon children there s a discernible lack of enthusiasm from almost everyone involved  and duff  who s gone from wholesome to haggard in two short years  is flat out scary this is definitely a family trip to stay home and skip there s something pernicious about a toxic mix of sitcom and snickering sex jokes getting packaged and effectively sold as wholesome fun for the family its heart is in the right place  but a reliance on gimmicks and sentiment undermines the story  in the end  both the laughs and the tears here come just a little too cheap  all i wanted to do was rent ron howard s parenthood again just to remind myself that steve martin once made a film about families that was both honest and funny martin and levy mug for their close ups and then retire to their trailers while the stunt doubles do the really hard work a couple of good chuckles can t redeem this sappy mess a miserable experience filled with crude slapstick  cruder sentiment and retrograde jokes     takes  a dated  sitcom approach that reveals just how little the filmmakers think of their audience a family fantasy that plays at being happy and picture perfect but primarily comes off as fake and dismayingly unfunny the treacle spreads like molten lava and everyone ends up flat on their molasses if you go to this movie and find any decent laugh in there whatsoever  you should know right now that i have nothing but utter contempt for you  a  cinematic bataan death march of pratfalls  kicks to the crotch  leg humping dogs  pseudo adorable rugrats who are a collective menace to society  and stomach turning schmaltz   this sequel is just a string of lame slapstick gags  where steve martin acts handicapped  makes a fool of himself and gets a wetsuit stuck up his butt cheaper by the gross here s a sentence i never thought i d write  carmen electra is more interesting than steve martin this cheerless  tiresome sequel is so tastless and flimsy that it proves big families aren t much fun after all i wonder how many meetings they had before they came up with that title  and didn t we just see this movie a couple of weeks ago  and wasn t it called yours  mine and ours any movie that stars steve martin and bonnie hunt can t be all bad  and this one isn t     you may get a half hour sitcom s worth of laughs  but little more     feels cobbled together by a committee fresh from a marathon of family reunion and summer camp comedies crammed with moppet mayhem  mawkish sentiment and bruising slapstick  it s a flat footed retread only right to lifers could love even the bloopers during the closing credits stink the humor in sam harper s script is as malnourished as hilary duff appears to be for the most part  director adam shankman keeps the mayhem comprehensible it aims to be pleasant and good natured  which it is  there are enough laughs scattered throughout to keep everything moderately amusing  and the cast is likeable while their last movie relied on boisterous physical humor  this is built on a family feud the movie may play better on video screens in the back of minivans  but i suspect even seat belted children will remain unimpressed shankman drops the ball at the finish line  jettisoning the tough love fun for cheap sentimentality this by the numbers pratfall fest is as synthetically generic as a  happy holidays  card from your realtor the kids will love it  parents will just have to put up with it  this film is funniest when it doesn t try so hard sequels to comedies usually come with a risk to one s digestive system  and sequels to bad comedies should carry a warning label unfortunately in this instance  more doesn t make merry  only mayhem two dozens and ours together don t have a dozen laughs between them moviegoers who enjoyed the pg anarchy the first time around should find amusement in the second dozen  if the last picture left you with a migraine and a sense of claustrophobia  the sequel will be another bout of pain unfortunately  this family comedy doesn t live up to its promising premise there is no hilarity  just a couple of veteran funnymen going through the hellishly predictable motions in this unimaginative and unnecessary sequel there is a good movie to be made about the difficulties parents have in letting go of their children  actually  ron howard already made that movie  it was called parenthood and it starred steve martin if the creators seem lethally bored with their product  most viewers will find their patience tested  too the film is at its best when it s not trying to be desperately funny  but that s rare i did say almost  as comedies and sequels go  this one still isn t any good  the writing by screenwriter sam harper is astonishingly limp  going to places even a bad nbc sitcom would be afraid to tread a cheerless sequel to an uninspired remake jimmy s kids  resentment is noticed only by the keenly attentive carmen electra  this half hearted  obviously obligatory sequel feels labored and twice as long as it really is cute kids  harried fathers  wise  understanding mothers  some stupid pet tricks  a little girl falls in love  over protective father messes things up  money isn t everything  tender moments  and lots of pratfalls sure ain t a movie  nope  it s a product  pure and very simple and carefully tested to sell to the widest possible market all the characters get in fights but  spoiler alert  everything ends with hugs  violins  good wishes and warm hearts as i watched this sequel  a certain good feeling began to make itself known  yes  the movie is unnecessary  however  it is unnecessary at a higher level of warmth and humor than the recent remake yours  mine and ours it s a strange feeling to come out of a movie aimed at kids  much less a sequel to something like cheaper by the dozen  and not feel as though i need a shower and a vasectomy after making shopgirl  it appears steve martin had a lobotomy yeah  cheaper is right bland  canned but studiously professional a harmless  inoffensive bit of family programming during the holiday season    and there s nothing wrong with that  but  harmless  doesn t have to mean dull this messy blend of silly slapstick and oversentimentality probably won t please children  teenagers or adults heed my warning  unless you guys stop going en masse to movies like the first cheaper by the dozen  genuinely funny people like hunt  martin and levy will forever be forced to pay their heating bills doing bland franchise fillers like this martin s soul is for sale  dirt cheap shallow  meandering  predictable  padded  and jam packed with one unfunny  hoarily conceived slapstick bit or pratfall after the next the big baker clan goes for a vacation at a wisconsin lake  and we get drowned in a sea of slapstick and schmaltz   but it s actually an improvement on its predecessor concerned with pat platitudes about learning to say goodbye  the importance of family  and the superiority of parental leniency over authoritarian strictness okay  everybody  back to your shopping  there s nothing to see here nannannannannanthe real appeal of the movie is bolt himself  the combined talents of the disney animators and john travolta s earnest voice work make for one lovable mutt  a film with a great story and something for everyone   full review in spanish restores some faith that there are some creative minds left in animated films that pixar hasn t added to its talent pool it s sophisticated look is rich with details that are easy to take for granted  but which add immeasurably to the texture and dimension of the scenes the latest generation of animated flicks is a sort of latter day vaudeville revue  kiddies who take bolt to heart may conclude not only that dogs really do have superpowers  but also that everybody s in showbiz wait    an all star voice cast for a computer animated story we ve never heard of before  and it s watchable  too a touch slight by disney standards  but even if it s not high art  it s still warm and fuzzy fun bolt marks disney s long awaited re emergence as a top dog in the world of animation    a fairly winning animated endeavor what bolt lacks in originality it makes up for in execution unmistakably bears the conflicting influence of pixar and disney s old ideals are your kids ready for an existential movie  turns out they are  disney s cgi animated action comedy bolt is  at its core  a story of one individual s discovery that his sense of reality   has been seriously skewed   blu ray focused  fun and action packed  disney s bolt proves that it doesn t need the pixar banner to make an excellent cg animated film john travolta s earnest  gentle voice performance as the title character goes a long way in making this disney animated feature a winner so much fun  you might be tempted to conclude that disney s acquisition of the amazing pixar team has inspired the already in house disney team to new heights molonoti me ton lasseter kapoy pano ap  tin paragogi  na tis dinei aroma pixar  i prototypia tis tainias tis disney eksantleitai se merika oraia panarismata kai

energy and invention enough to keep lasseter top of the heap the wonderfully expressive features on bolt make him feel almost real and the movie has enough charm and humour to please both adults and children the latest disney animation has everything going for it  from a cast including john travolta and miley cyrus to a truly brilliant premise bolt s nothing short of a winning mix of pixel perfect magic tremendously lovable and funny stuff wittier by the reel  bolt is can t miss family entertainment  and a glad relief from the solemnities of award season bolt is a damn enjoyable and undeniably funny film for entertainment value  there s nothing this week to rival bolt  it s a clever  funny family film bolt has all the wit  wisdom and top class computer imagery of a pixar film  with the star voice cast of a disney release bolt is fast paced  funny and beautifully animated    a charming movie that would have benji and lassie howling in jealousy the unlikely superhero of this film is the hamster  who brings the funny amid a flurry of weaker gags  but bolt still has charm   it just won t hit with the adults the way the best animated films can its hero may lack any real super bark but this comic cartoon comes with a sharply ironic bite the fact that the hamster steals the film speaks volumes about the lack of fresh ingredients it s a neat progression for disney that finds balance between the studio s old school charm and pixar s dynamic modern outlook if a little twee for grown ups  this is riotous fun for kids  even if it s not pixar perfect  it ll definitely do until up touches down even if it s a bit too knowing in places for children and a bit lightweight in others for adults  as a whole it gives pixar every chance to show that even with a moderate story line it can give us something to savour it s a lovely  often hilarious piece of work great action and witty sight gags raise the toon bar there really isn t anything terribly fresh nor distinctive here super cute  even though there s not much there bolt combines pixar smarts with classic disney storytelling while it may lack a certain amount of bite  there s plenty of bark to recommend this winning animated adventure adults should get a good kick out of these animal characters and the exemplary personality quirks that go beyond just image perfection if you feel as though you need to borrow a child to buy a ticket for this cutest of cute films  go right ahead  you won t want to miss this adorable animated film about a dog who thinks he s a superhero bolt  is consistently entertaining because its characters are so endearing this lively animated adventure keeps us entertained even if the story and characters aren t particularly well developedthis is the best action adventure movie for kids i ve seen in a long  long time a frisky addition to that collection of man s best friend movies  with a generous portion of one joke fits all humor to captivate kid and adult audiences alike with the holiday season officially underway   bolt  is the perfect present for the whole family it s entertaining while it lasts but dissipates from memory the moment it s over bolt is a good but not great film which should earn walt disney animation a deserved hit even if it won t quite return them to the heights of their own creative and commercial heyday let s not underestimate the significance of a workmanlike disney animation super dog adventure is fun  age appropriate for kids bolt is an insignificant cartoon  but undeniably enjoyable  i was smiling through most of it and i imagine kids will too bolt  more like sparky  the movie is nowhere near as good as this year s best animated film   wall e   but it does zip with energy  the story escalates nicely and  in the end  it s a good time the unappealing cross country trip of a dog  a cat  and a hamster there s something both simple and sweet about bolt  yet epic  that s entirely surprising    arguably the best non pixar  animated  film that disney has released in some time     a t best  it s an amusing by the numbers effort straight ahead star power is provided by teeny bop pop star miley cyrus as penny and john travolta who looks better as an animated dog than he did in drag in hairspray that it falls short of pixar s lofty heights doesn t mean the attempt isn t worthwhile  indeed  bolt is the most entertaining and well crafted disney animation movie in years belief may be in question for much of the movie    only for the perturbed pooch    but fortunately  enjoyment is never a problem if only first time directors chris williams and byron howard would have followed the advice in their own film  bolt could have turned out to be incredibly extraordinary bolt is packed with action sequences  but it finds room for humor and heart  too whenever a new kids  film comes out  there s always the hope that it ll work for adults  too  alas  not this time  but the kids will probably like it sharply drawn supporting characters  a solid narrative hook and slickly constructed action adventure sequences help make for a vibrant  engaging  feel good treat that will connect strongly with younger viewers bolt  with its numerous winks and nudges  reminds us how attuned we are to the falseness of pop culture  which isn t the same thing as connecting us with its truths while bolt isn t as funny  memorable or inspired as the animation classic from which it pilfers  it s still beautifully animated  cleanly told  professionally voiced and makes you smile without insulting your intelligence overall it s basically a crass marketing concept closer to beverly hills chihuahua than a fully conceived work of art like wall e disney surely sees that inside the kinetic movement of pixar films is a lot of restraint  bolt is super fast  yet not as super sincere as it would like to believe wall e  it s not  but its target kiddie audience will have no problem whatsoever adopting bolt at the end of the day  bolt is a sweet disney family film  but lasseter s oversight has made it smarter than it otherwise would have been you won t need to keep a pack of tissue at the ready here  but bolt does have some lump in the throat moments courtesy of a vividly drawn  huggable main character you grow to love bolt isn t a dazzler  but it s entertainment with heart i m never a big fan of animal films and i admit it s because  though i am by no means a crier  pets losing their friends or getting lost gets me all choked up  frankly  it s embarrassing  but if you can make me sniffle  you ve won me over  bolt   sniffit s smart enough to keep adults on their toes and exciting enough to keep a kid with a short attention span glued to his seat what this mutt lacks in uniqueness it makes up for in puppyish charm  high class velocity and enough pop culture crackle to keep most demographics suitably amused the directors and screenwriters hit all their marks and push all the right buttons  but the story never really takes off  and the characters never really spark to life adults won t find much to enjoy here  though the dog s high octane action series serves as a perverse parody of jerry bruckheimer style summer blockbusters bolt has the magical quality of great animation  the ability to touch us without the hint of preachiness or manipulation the format brilliantly brings an audience that much closer to a handful of increasingly lonely  yet contagiously enthusiastic  animals its script is smart  its conceit a heart tugger in the finest of senses  and it s the first disney effort in way too long to be more concerned with being a movie than with being a breeding ground for product tie ins make a little room lady  tramp and all you dalmatians  disney s got a new animated dog to bark about no future classic  but a pleasant little movie with a fiercely devoted little hero with its vibrant look  frisky attitude and sweet lesson about loyalty and friendship  bolt is solid  fresh family friendly entertainment the film breezes by in what feels like an instant  the emotional warmth exuded by the relationships within both genuine and true cute  clever  and enjoyable bolt s double identity allows young viewers to imagine the fun of owning a cuter version of krypto while it also affirms charles m  schulz s assertion that happiness is a warm puppy   in its best moments  it gently shows us how bolt s discoveries parallel those of a child in learning self reliance like  homeward bound  and  incredible journey   it teaches tiny tots that   with friendship and love   you don t need superpowers to be a hero a holiday standout if bolt does not quite rise to the level of bona fide pixar masterpieces like wall e  finding nemo and ratatouille  it does manage to be frisky  funny and inventive enough to engage the attention of grown ups as well as children to paraphrase a line often misattributed to samuel johnson  this disney aspires to pixar combination is both original and good  the problem is the original parts aren t good and the good parts aren t original as usual  the sidekick animals steal the show  that tradition goes all the way back to those singing mice in cinderella  maybe even before then well made  pleasant  diverting  unobjectionable    and absolutely nothing special if you can get past the wafer thin premise that serves as the foundation for bolt  you ll find that it is a rather entertaining movie a key part of the film s success is that penny  the object of bolt s devotion  really is a sweet kid who loves her furry co star while bolt doesn t quite contain the same charm and slick storytelling that defines the pixar films  it is still a mostly enjoyable film that should appeal to all ages the story is shamelessly derivative  but you won t mind much because it s so gentle and warm hearted bolt s  basic story is nothing too original  but its underpinnings and flourishes are smart and inventive has the right amount of sincerity  schmaltz and silliness to make bolt entertaining for everyonefunny  charming  and a feast for the eyes  it is also quite probably the best animated film made by disney in years parental content reviewboasts much of the humor  character development  story layering  and unmistakable heart pixar has brought to the animation genrethe writing team of dan fogelman and co director williams have concocted one of the most witty and often hilarious disney outings in years bolt is a jolt of joy  a computer animated delight that is delirious with laughs funny and heartwarming  if not entirely original  bolt is bound to charm audiences of all ages charming and frequently exciting what i couldn t predict was how much i would enjoy the simple pleasures of a warm  witty  well written story    especially when it is told with the state of the art computer animation that is easy to take for granted in these techno savvy days the digital comedy adventure starts out pretty slow and never really finds its footing  especially in regards to its needed comic edge bolt is earnest  wholesome  family entertainment  in a word  it s disney  which seems to have remembered that those attributes are really nothing to be ashamed of while this charmer about a canine james bond does not pack the emotional punch of wall e  it s frisky fun to see the white shepherd get a new leash on life no classic but not a dog in spite of being about one for the first time in years  it feels like disney has done its namesake proud it s a seriously withholding action comedy  stingy on the wit  charm  jokes  narrative satisfactions and animals with personalities sharp enough for the big screen familiar territory  but the disney team still knows how to bring a story to life a warm and even perceptive family film  not always original but undeniably sweet natured a digital hamster takes on pixar s industry domination   and kicks butt the story is somewhat predictable  but it s sweet and happy and the animation is first rate there s something touching about the yearning for ordinary life and decency that  to judge by its ubiquity in films for the nominally innocent  plagues those who live and work in the realms of the unreal your pre tweens and tweens will love bolt  though  the good news is that there s an excellent chance you ll like it  too fun  four legged scampering isn t enough when the characters are so unmemorable  the high concept is so wobbly and the journey doesn t have you rooting for a reunion mild amusement is about the best you can hope for  but bolt never bores bolt is a winner and proof that disney animation is really trying to catch up to pixar in both story quality and animation it s a great day in america when the complicated looks so easy  and when we expect smart storytelling as a rule  not the exception pixar masterpieces aside  it s been quite a while since disney cranked out an animated movie worthy of its fairy dust sprinkled castle logo the film succeeds because it has genuine heart  a couple of mildly thrilling action sequences  and most notably  a hilarious supporting performance by mark walton  who plays rhino the hamster bolt is perfectly amiable but rarely brisk  with neither its premise nor its execution quite inspired enough to elicit more than faint admiration the lack of screenwriting imagination is offset by the inherent charm of the picture  resulting in a pleasing arrangement of cg animated action set pieces and slapstick comedy to push bolt beyond the repetitive family film norm disney s movie taps into our desire to believe that the happy hound sleeping at the end of our beds is as brave  noble  loyal  and devoted as he seems  a s sensitive and spirited as  it is  gorgeous to look at    w hen the canine protagonist of bolt borrows a character arc from buzz lightyear  even youngsters will smell a rip off disney s strongest cg animated effort to date can be credited to the strength of a premise that mixes what s worked so well in earlier disney animated films with a better awareness of what makes a movie entertaining both for kids and adults it s got a great ensemble cast  it s not the most original idea but still effective nonetheless the film is funny    with a sophistication that might actually appeal more to adults  but there s still plenty for the kids to enjoy the disney animated blockbuster to be bolt is a delightful family movie  and if i d seen it as a kid i would have been deeply traumatized movie magic aplenty in animated action adventure from disney although it will never be mistaken for pixar pedigree  this genial production is a notable step up for walt disney animation studios nanthe fact that this trilogy has concluded is for the best  there s nowhere else for these characters to go if this movie had a theme song it would be   the lazy song  by bruno mars because its doing nothing at all here  while the routines are as polished as ever  everything else is tired  not least fat amy s fat jokes  time for a new song  ladies a lot of what makes the franchise special and fun feels forced here the bellas even know that they are past their prime and this film acts as one last hoopla for them dialog is still witty enough to keep us laughing  but the characters are now saddled with contrived plotlines  corny slapstick and some feeble attempts at sentimentality the strain is showing in this third entry  with too many of the characters placed in developmental holding patterns and too much of the storyline given over to daft contrivances fans will be pleased enough with the slapstick and musical offerings here  rebel wilson  again  owns the film with her pleasantly abrasive wit  her broad appeal spiced by the fact that this is her first movie to come out after her libel case victory     a festive film   full review in spanish  this third delivery ends up having the best numbers and the most ingenious mash up s of the franchise   full review in spanish the film has a bigger budget than the previous outings   glitzy european locations  star cameos and so on   but none of the charm the musical part is still a guilty pleasure   full review in spanish if ever a flimsy film franchise was going to fold in on itself by instalment three  you would bet the house it would be pitch perfect the film s message   about moving on and letting go of the past   is one that it seems incapable of taking on board for all its frivolity  fans should be more than satisfied with this final run around the track  as a fan of the original  i was let down  hopefully that ll be the end of the series whatever else is true of the movie  the cast is having fun  and anna kendrick gives phenomenal reaction shots the pitch might not be perfect but might appeal to fans of the franchise this franchise ran out of steam halfway through the credit crawl on the first movie  and there s been nothing but garbage in garbage out since then     ends the trilogy with so much blunder     full review in spanish should future encores take the stage  we can only hope they have a little more verve and imagination than this one the biggest cause of the film s problems lies in the b story in which amy s father  played by john lithgow sporting a horrendous australian accent  shows up trying to reconnect  as the movie wraps   and it really does feel like it s a tidy wrap up and a goodbye to them   you might even realize how much you ll miss them in the future it s good for nostalgia and a sense of closure  but it isn t much of a movie a movie we ve seen and heard before  fresher  cuter and five years ago  the series limps its way to the finish line with a weak  not particularly funny effort the real hit of this third pp outing comes  as ever  from the cast the plot is paper thin and too much of the comedy is reliant on the one note battering ram that is rebel wilson a comic franchise that has stayed loosely in tune with reality now goes screeching off into nonsense  with no good jokes to show for it a ca trocious this is a movie that wants you to laugh and enjoy the music  not engage in analysis  it s time for the barden bellas to either exit stage left or be dragged off by the hook the threequel goes for a big finale  but ends up flat when it strains to rope in new genres a typically winning central turn from kendrick and some pitch perfect staples just about save the day  pitch perfect finally leaves the stage  and after a solid performance too someone get masterful video game director hideo kojima on the line and throw out the idea for metal gear fat amythe second  and now third installments have turned into meandering messes with few jokes that land and a cast that  while talented  doesn t really get to do much out of tune if this really is the last  pitch perfect  movie  i hate to contradict that  cups  song  but we re not going to miss them when they re gone  when they re gone it feels as if this party is over and it is time to call it a day this swan song is in serious need of some auto tune as surprising and unlikely as it may seem  the third time is finally and most definitely the charm for this series the top secret of a capella competition movies when a franchise descends to jokes about how it s run out of ideas  and setting things on fire  not once but twice  it s one movie past time to stop the final pitch is a big miss the wafer thin plot barely sustains the songs and romance although i do think pp fans will be satisfied with the finale  let s hope this is the last redux for these pitches the film feels like a flimsy attempt to get the bellas back together  it s bereft of good ideas and tone deaf in terms of decent dialogue the third and final installment in the  pitch perfect  franchise is aca blah aca nough already an off key dismantling of what made the concept work in the first place a coarse  ugly  pointlessly action packed reminder that every modestly sharp and amusing property must eventually be converted  by the commercial logic of hollywood  into a soul killing cash grab the slim charms of the previous movies have been tossed away in favor of cringe inducing cattiness and a ridiculous plot  there s barely even any music  aca palling the show s over  we re pitched out  aca exit stage left the new third entry in the series isn t interested in character development or logical storylines or anything resembling innovation  it s lazy and limp and profoundly weird  and not in any meaningful way a  good movie teenage boys get their shape shifting robots  angry cars  and space wars  so if the bellas want to sing  oops i did it again  on a rocket  let them have it uneven series finale is best when there s music  despite the on screen intelligence of kendrick  plus a screenplay co written by mike white  this is a near plotless  slapdash comedy marked by low energy improvisation and strained slapstick a total delight  thanks to its proven formula of clever pop arrangements  dry humor and superb casting unfortunately  it takes a sharp detour and goes down the action route  which ends up misfiring  with a thinnier  sillier story than ever before  the threequel is left with its twin pillars of appeal  musical performances by the core cast  and shtick  also by the core cast  if you must   come for the jokes  the song and dance numbers  and the female camaraderie  stay for    well  for those thingsthe bellas aren t invested in the film s competition  and the filmmakers  aren t invested in it  and you probably won t be  either  so why bother even having one women deserve a better vehicle for demonstrating the power of female solidarity than this empty money grab but it also ends with a sentimentality i didn t buy   the bellas don t seem to particularly care about each other outside of a competitive setting  so why should we while this has a few laugh out loud moments  overall  this is an adequate farewell performance that too often falls flat and feels off key as it jumps from one song to the next  the flimsy plot and occasionally amusing one liners move to a generic beat but there s enough energy in the musical numbers to deliver cheesy and diverting fun a tired retread of better jokes in the first two movies  this drags along to an admittedly heartwarming conclusion gross  messy  unapologetic  awkward  stumbling   the women of pitch perfect are far from flawless  but the franchise never congratulates itself for that  newsflash  this is how real women are the third outing in the  pitch perfect  franchise is like a pop song remix that retains some of what you love about the original  while throwing in an out of nowhere bridge and an unwelcome guest verse a strange hodgepodge of genres and tones  right down to a particularly off putting mid section montage that serves as a classic move the story along device the bellas  musical journey has been stretched into a thin whimper  the movie is bubbly  it s fast  it s hella synthetic clever  and it s an avid showcase for the personalities of its stars    it looks like these performers are genuinely enjoying themselves  and it s infectious  despite the preposterous escapades and the self destructive satire  at the end of it all  there s something real left standing an entertaining if lifeless sequel  failing to capture the fun and vivacity of the first two films  something of a greatest hits album thrown into the shops in time for christmas    not so much a story as a victory lap   once the uso tour is set into motion  it falls to wilson to provide much of the humor here  and she is a skilled enough comic to push the narrative over most of its hurdles  but even she can t quite finesse or explain john lithgow eastwood and his actors create a brooding drama whose events and interrelationships seem surreally improbable yet painfully authentic one of its best qualities is that it s dark but not depressing  it is a film of magisterial  slow burning power  one of the finest examples of recent american cinematic storytelling and certainly eastwood s most mature film eastwood tells the story simply  barely moving the camera  the only special effect in this film is genius there is nothing romantic about the law of the streets  and its unforgiving nature has a finality that can t be undone  eastwood has an understanding of what it takes to live with yourself  not so much a sympathy as an appreciation the entire cast did a phenomenal job  resisting the urge to overact too much  which is what you get for a film like this  violence and revenge have been a staple of eastwood s work from the beginning  but here he explores his subject from a new  more ambiguous angle  with no regard for macho titillation  american drama doesn t get any more meaty and muscular than this the performances are uniformly superb good  occasionally powerful noir that s been overhyped mystic falters occasionally  but i respect its effort and i m happy to see mr  eastwood growing as a director while not quite the equal of the novel  it s more complex  emotionally charged and better acted than the average hollywood thriller with characters that don t belong in the film and resolutions that seem mere fantasy  mystic river never surpasses adequacy it is in many ways eastwood s tightest movie for some time  and certainly his darkest since unforgiven  indeed  the ending offers as corrosive an assessment of the limits of american justice as anything in his career a sprawling story that benefits from eastwood s stripped down approach  there are no jive talking tarantino exchanges here  and no crowd pleasing pyrotechnics this is one of the finer dramas to come down the pike in some time the film births wonderful performances from all three lead actors  as well as marcia gay harden  who s palpable in preternatural ways  thomas guiry as the boy in love with jimmy s daughter  and virtually everyone else with a strip of film time it s a stately  handsome looking studio drama that  for me  never really became emotionally or intellectually involving     frustratingly humorless  harsh  and hollow  lacking the cohesiveness  color and convincing characterization of eastwood s masterpiece unforgiven penn and robbins  especially  are absolutely riveting in this haunting tale of lives lost methodical  riveting and emotionally charged sean penn is so frighteningly good in this movie that he outdoes even the best of his earlier work a fine movie but not the masterpiece you ve heard eastwood s best since unforgiven mystic river explores the quirks of fate that make us who and what we are  r uns deep with sadness   it s not the masterpiece people have been claiming  but eastwood does set up a gripping moody atmosphere and get some fine performances out of his actors a tale of tragic misinterpretation  mystic river requires deep focus into the multiple tortured souls to fully be harnessed eastwood encourages penn to overact  and penn method ically responds with the enthusiasm of the amateur talents in waiting for guffman this is the kind of film that slowly gets under your skin  drawing you more intimately into the sad existence of the characters less a taut whodunit than a dreary who cares it  mystic river is muddy swamp slow and about as appealing to look atthe unfashionably slow editing style and the concentration on close ups and two shots allow eastwood to scrutinise his characters as they are forced to dig into themselves while it may not be the masterpiece that some claim  it does have the heft and texture of a major work let s make it simple  mystic river is the great hollywood studio film released this year robbins and penn in particular give simply fantastic performances that defy description   it is the kind of work you have to just sit back and feel fiction doesn t survive on believability alone  the unilluminating mystic river offers depression without insight  drama without purpose works as a straight up detective story  and the acting is often breathtaking it s a film worth queuing for   and you haven t been able to say that about anything with clint s name on it in quite a while mystic river draws its power from the shadow murder throws over everyday life when a murder mystery stars sean penn  tim robbins  and kevin bacon you re gonna have a hard time picking the killer  eastwood directs without a trace of showiness a superbly dense and dark thriller with psychological undertones  mystic river is highly complex and tantalising a flawed but engaging film  mystic river succeeds through the sheer weight of talent involved mystic river returns eastwood to the general excellence of the oscar winning unforgiven while retaining the square jawed plainspokenness that is his trademark i can admit it s a well made film  but that doesn t mean i approve eastwood s screen adaptation of the famous dennis lehane novel is one of the year s most well made dramas despite a nagging sensation about its shortcomings  the acting and the atmospherics continue to haunt me tim robbins took me on a wild chase  i think he was by far the best in this movie a deeply felt  haunting work that ranks among eastwood s best films   while restrained and internal throughout most of the film  penn displays both chilling intensity and heart wrenching grief when it really counts everyone in the cast is brilliant  everyone this is a flawed film worth seeing for the portraits of three hollow men  and for stern s great camera work mystic river  is teeming with various elements that flow together to create one of the finest movies of the year an engrossing film that delights despite harboring what could be seen as a big flaw too depressing to fill audiences with delight  but it does seem to validate questionable attitudes  especially an indifference to the suffering of innocent people and a willingness to shoot first and ask questions later it s serious with a capital  s   it s the kind of grimness that smacks of a bid for importance with a capital  i     hopefully leading to an oscar with a captial  o  it s penn s heavy lidded  dead behind the eyes turn that overshadows all  carrying the weight  pain and misery of the world    and the picture a film with better intentions than execution a mournful meditation on america s heritage of violence   the real triumph is that while we are fascinated with the particulars of the story  we feel the shame  awkwardness  fears and cosmic fate that bounce off each character while a commercial film is more about entertainment  this is more about  for want of a better term  art mystic river may only be  pretty good   but thanks to eastwood  it s a reminder of how great  pretty good  should be so entrenched in anguish that you ll leave feeling empty and unhappy penn s performance galvanizes grief as an emotional rumination on death and its aftermath  it is gripping     bores its way in and lingers for hours  even days before we finally can come to terms with it   and ourselves  but the less we know  the more we understand an apprehensive cross between an elegiac tone poem of loss  an ever twisting murder mystery  and a character study revolving around the regret of lost innocence  mystic river tries to be all of these things and ends up falling short on all counts deeply serious  sombre  long and humourless  it reeks of integrity  eastwood s best since unforgiven  maybe  but it s the one i d least like to sit through again a lot more effective than most similar cop thrillers that go only for the conventional bang bang scenarios shows you can pile on a lot of freight and still end up with a barge if sean penn isn t the finest actor working today  mystic river sure makes it difficult to name an alternative solid  rarely showy performances  meticulously recreated detective work and moments of pure unadulterated grief accent this whodunit  a movie that will have those who haven t read the book fooled for much of its length eastwood has crafted one of the most powerful american dramas in years while seemingly a straightforward murder mystery in a matter of fact setting  it is never quite what it seems  and it percolates with themes and ideas of astonishing richness contains so many layers that you ll want to see it more than once  it s one for the memory books there is depth in this movie  and fine acting  but even more intriguing  there are questions    questions with no clear answers eastwood has transformed the slow burn he s shown in so many of his movies in the past and brought it to every character in this movie  and to this top notch film eastwood s hands off directing normally leaves much to desire  but with mystic river s powerful house cast and emotional gut wretching story  one respects the lack of showiness and triteness i can t figure out why  but it didn t really stick with me once i left the theater  it s very good  but not transcendent eastwood has turned lehane s novel into a quietly brilliant and deeply unsettling film that ranks up with unforgiven as his best directing work sober and imposing  clint eastwood s mystic river spreads over the screen with a sense of purpose smart  hard charging  compassionate the experience of being so absorbed in a movie and the lives of the people in it  of trusting a director and a writer and actors to take me places completely unexpected  is so rare that i savored every unexpected turn and twist so deep felt a movie about rage and retribution that will stick with you like a bad dream this crime oriented portrait of characters snared by their environment leads to an excruciatingly powerful buildup  before it surrenders to contrivance in its final act clint eastwood s latest directorial effort is perhaps the best film he s ever made  a  stunning mediation on loss   those who can stomach the dark subject matter and the daunting running time are rewarded with a work of sublime maturity eastwood s maturity is reflected in the story that doesn t back away from hard subjects and can admit that pain and remorse can mold a man s life resonates more deeply than any film this year a solid whodunit  with disturbing  provocative  take home insights into human nature a masterpiece of the first order deals with themes eastwood has often explored before  but never so delicately or with as much sad wisdom  the way in which our past haunts our present  the lasting repercussions of violence and the cruel inexorability of fate it is an impressive movie masquerading as an important one a deeply atmospheric murder mystery in which we wonder less about who committed the crime and more about who will ultimately pay for it eastwood has handed penn the role of a lifetime  and the actor scorches the screen with his anguish and angry vengefulness  eastwood  masterfully gives the story and characters their proper amount of breathing room and translates the script into fluid  fertile visual passages dripping with heart  heartache  passion  compassion and rage complicated  enigmatic and haunting   easily eastwood s best film since  unforgiven   and one of the most compelling pictures of the year a measured  leisurely paced but moving shakespearean tragedy a masterfully melancholy work with an oscar worthy screenplay a leisurely paced  intense  gloomy but ultimately  fulfilling motion picture eastwood and his terrific cast leave you shaken in ways that matter it s easy to run out of superlatives when describing this movie    no doubt this is one of the best pictures of the year vibrant and coldly compelling  mystic river succeeds in spinning a profoundly american tale on the level of grand tragedy one thing you can count on from clint  it s making a movie that seems a lot longer than it really is  i m not sure that s a great quality to have when it comes to filmmaking mystic river is refreshingly adult  eastwood doesn t pander to a younger crowdthis victims of circumstance crime yarn betters the book in a number of ways eastwood  isn t afraid to take his time telling a story  letting it breathe like a good wine and thereby making it feel more like life than a movie mystic river is pretty strong stuff  the best straight drama to emerge from hollywood this year director clint eastwood has mined more oscar gold with his most profound work since  unforgiven  the type of film i imagine you could return to time and again only to discover previously unseen layers it s also the best movie made by any american filmmaker this year  and quite possible the best thing eastwood has ever done as a director if euripides had ever known catholic guilt  he might have written something quite similar to mystic river despite all involved  mystic river never quite equals the sum of its parts    another eastwood meditation on the ripple effect of violence eastwood and his perfectly cast ensemble have added layers that give this blue collar multi generational tragedy shakespearean scope  it is one of those rare films that surpasses the impact of the book as rich and bleeding a work as  eastwood has  ever made for all its missteps  mystic river gets the big things right  it turns you inside out with grief uneven but ultimately absorbing adaptation of dennis lehane s best selling novel despite dragging a little  mystic river is worth its weight in what will certainly be oscar gold there is a solid story here  but it s weakened by heavy handed dialogue  strained symbolism and subplots that don t got anywhere don t be fooled by the contemporary boston setting  for all intents and purposes  clint eastwood has made another superlative western when someone sets out to tell a story about child molestation and murder of teenagers  you don t expect a happy  fun time    but the story doesn t say anything unique about these depressing subjects clint eastwood s best film since unforgiven is another look at murder  death and the good in men that can die long before they do a melodramatic murder mystery that is as uneven as its outcome is anticlimactic  mystic river  is an ambitious failure but it is  ultimately  a failure  it is a shame because there are a lot of little things that i liked about it even as the big things never quite added up splendid acting by sean penn as the merchant  kevin bacon as the cop  laurence fishburne as his partner  tim robbins as dave  and laura linney and marcia gay harden as the central female characters in the story if mystic river is just a bit overplayed  a tad too highly pitched  it still resonates with grief and fury and feeling the movie eloquently mourns the death of innocence and friendship  it also is a showcase for six stunning performances the performances are exquisite intelligent adult fare is hard to find on the big screen  but clint eastwood manages nicely with this tough ensemble piece the acting throughout is exceptional  rooted in observed realism  but suggestive of more mythical agents at work through the lives of human beings a truly powerful portrait of community and lost innocence the film and its actors are at their best when acknowledging the tragedy of inarticulate men banging their heads against fate up the mystic river without a paddle is how i felt about halfway into this soggy eastwood meets melodrama mess of a movie eastwood s most soulful  and most organic  movie it is a movie to closely watch and to savour  the confident direction and the flawless ensemble performances are  quite simply  worthy of oscars it would be wrong to single out any one of these performances  eastwood has assembled a bonanza cast here and each comes out shining if  eastwood  were a more subtle director  it would be a great film  as it is  it s an extremely good one  anchored by the subtly devastating performances of penn  robbins and bacon mystic river is a rare movie that improves on its source material  it was a very good book  but the movie is great mystic river is full of details that stay with you a movie experience that carries a lingering  powerful aftershock an adult drama rich in emotional textures eastwood s best direction since unforgiven and arguably the best  most mature work of his career excellent  an  utterly absorbing film a riveting story with complex situations and extremely well defined characters crisply well crafted and beautifully acted river leads moviegoers on a suspense filled  sometimes painful adventure marked by great performances a compelling film that could have been a classic with some judicious editing in the end and a rethink of the climax not quite the great american tragedy  by a moving work exploring the underbelly of family lives it wants to be a big  serious movie  it has big  serious star power and big  serious themes  there are moments of power and flickers of meaning but it is ultimately hollow and unsatisfying mystic river left me physically shaking  and has since taken up permanent residence in my nightmares there s no emotional connection to the characters  this is cookie cutter anguish meant to manipulate the gullible into believing that they re watching something meaningful i am so accustomed to inventing  angles  for my reviews that a movie like this threatens to flummox me  it defies all angles and conventional approaches a modern epic tragedy  where the weight of everyone s actions are felt from conception to enactment a virtuoso achievement for everyone involved whose final credits actually read  music by clint eastwood   if a more apropos coda could exist  i couldn t think of one there s something to the tribal primitivism of the picture  the idea that man at his essence is composed of balanced portions of nobility and violence despite the faultless execution  this ultimately unedifying story of pointless murder is     hopelessly contrived so filled with extraordinary performances that you hardly know where to start in discussing it     penn  robbins  harden and eastwood all deserve oscar nominations slowly trudges through the motions of a tired whodunit  saving its dramatic juices for a blowout finale that never comes a powerful tale of crime  guilt  and punishment this is an extremely well crafted and powerful film with searing performances from the all star cast  most notably sean penn and tim robbins the performances are all good  however  the film experiences one coincidence after the other  manipulating its audiences rather heavy handedly each of the three childhood friends who grow up to become the main characters of mystic river brings the film a particular style of revelation this tense  gripping character study is a cleverly complex  powerful and original american tragedy  clint eastwood once again displays an astonishing visual sense  problem is  it s too obvious whodunit riveting moviemaking in the popular vein   eastwood avoids easy answers and sentimental compromises a tense murder mystery that finds director clint eastwood on familiar ground exploring themes of good and evil  guilt and innocence  anger and revenge resonates long after the last fade out a haunting  ambitious but ultimately flawed film that treads some of the same somber moral territory director clint eastwood explored in unforgiven after many meticulously drawn connections  it s a disappointment to see most of our two plus hours of careful attention thrown away mesmerizing filmmaking a solid crime thriller once again  a movie withholds vital information in order to pump up its dramatic level in the last act  this device may not be illegitimate  but   mystic river is the rare american movie that aspires to    and achieves    the full weight and darkness of tragedy this is mature  meaningful  thoroughly grown up filmmaking that has something vitally important to say about the expanding effects of violence in society what you end up admiring about the film is its literacy  its authenticity     and its refusal to let us down easily a classic whodunit plodding  emotionally inert  overlong  badly framed  inappropriately scored and polluted with an ensemble who try to outdo each other with bad performances and i take a page from ann miller and say it s all a load of horse puckey a somber evocation of a poor  close knit section of boston on the brink of moral collapse a whodunnit with a deeply emotional core  thanks to l a  confidential scripter brian helgeland s richly crafted  textured screenplay and the superb ensemble cast s outstanding individual performances and collective chemistry a movie of startling power and intimacy one of  eastwood s  boldest and most soulful films to date solid direction  unfussy scripting and terrific acting    particularly from penn    make the film a gripping experience mystic river is a complex  deeply ambiguous study of lifelong ties  moral accountability and the flukes of destiny a crisp  well made  visually astute film that will provoke and divide  eastwood s  admirers nannannannansecond city alum nia vardalos stars in this ethnic comedy  which she also wrote    an ambitious way to break into a leading role  too bad the results are insubstantial it s greek to me it offers the illusion of originality by bombarding audiences with greek stereotypes  but really clings to the formulaic romance comedy ms  vardalos  has loaded her charmingly fluffy script with cute idiosyncrasies in place of actual characters the result feels a little over egged at times and the love match lacks chemistry  but ian s whistlestop induction into a different style of language  food  drink  dress and dancing allows a few good one liners endearing eccentricities  such as toula s father s improvisational greek etymologies of words like  kimono  and his reliance on windex for a range of external use medicinal purposes  help humanize the characters it s funny  it s familiar and you can see a lot of the situations transferring over to your own life it is a romantic comedy in the best classic hollywood style  albeit one with some sharp writing and genuinely human as well as funny moments vardalos is not a great actress  but she is a likeable one     john corbett will never steer you wrong     a cute premise  but it has all been done beforethe family friendly film avoids pitfalls  but the dvd is skimpy the actors   bring out an attractive  warmhearted simplicity in each character  above all  they portray a close  loving family  the film s ultimate and lasting virtue a cute little movie whose success proves that wherever they can find it  people will rise up and embrace the most mediocre  bland  and reassuring forms of art almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like  the addams family  to everyone looking in     my big fat greek wedding  comes from the heart   on the whole  this film didn t make me laugh much  didn t make me  aaaaaah  much and didn t give me any more insight into its astronomical popularity this is not challenging stuff although films of this flavor depend primarily on their comic timing to win over an audience  director joel zwick finds other outlets of brilliance   this is the kind of romantic comedy you wish you saw more often my big fat greek wedding is a jubilant mix of laughter  longing  forgiveness  sacrifice  commitment and  above all  balancing family obligations against true love when vardalos tries to pass one joke stereotypes and situations as revelatory characterizations and experiences  it simply doesn t achieve anything noteworthy my big fat greek wedding may not exactly be an innovative film  but it most certainly is a lovable one great fun my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor to their credit  hanks and wilson stuck to their guns  keeping vardalos and her ethnicity in a film that is as much a triumph of the underdog and word of mouth as it is a box office success there is nothing subtle or original about this film  but it is well intentioned and cute warm  familiar  not a sharp edge in sight  this movie is built to please we can see the wheels turning  and we might resent it sometimes  but this is still a nice little picture  made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer only in the movies can joey fatone and andrea martin engage in hellenic dance    begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully it s enjoyable  with a cracking performance from michael constantine as toula s father gus there isn t enough drama to take my big greek wedding out of tv movie territory one of those movies that keeps you with a silly grin on your face throughout the majority of its running time we re sitting around the storyteller as she tells us about her family and all their crazy personalities and relationships with each other  and we can smile knowingly because family dynamics are easily relatable it would be enjoyed by anyone who has been married  is married  wants to get married  or knows someone who is married while i found the film of average entertainment  my friend loved it this will have all non greeks in the audience wishing they could lay claim to some mediterranean heritage a delightfully warm hearted look at the joys and exasperations of both family and ethnic heritage  an ode to everyday people and the joys of romance turning into lifelong love folks will come away from the film mistaking a warmth for their own experiences with an over abundance of affection for my big fat greek wedding i mean it only in the best sense when i say that my big fat greek wedding is a really nice movie exactly what its title implies  lusty  boisterous and utterly charming a film of pure delight from beginning to end the best date movie since when harry met sally a simple but likeable film that points out its characters  foibles while retaining an affection for their eccentricities a circus full of wacky and interesting characters balances the specifics of the greek american culture with the transcendent universalities of family dynamics and makes you want to hug your own family you don t have to be greek to enjoy my big fat greek wedding  and that s precisely the point of it full of obvious humour and stereotyped characters  my big fat greek wedding is nonetheless delightful  mostly because the movie does not pretend to be anything it isn t my big fat greek wedding is a very slim movie that succeeds on its own modest terms without pretense or apology  no wonder it s easy to like this isn t a groundbreaking movie     but its situations are so recognizable and universal that you don t need to be greek to appreciate it vardalos is great as toula and presents her character s traits and peculiarities fittingly well an embarrassment  a film so humiliating to everyone involved  it is shocking that protesters haven t come out of the woodwork to scream bloody murder an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom   you d be wise to send your regrets    manages   by virtue of its uncommon geniality   to convince us it s about genuine human beings the movie is consistently funny without ever going over the top    a rarity in movies there s something wonderful about chaotic ethnic comedies  and this film taps straight into that vein the reliability of the genre doesn t excuse predictable jokes  pat fiascoes and so many stereotypes that one is tempted to alert the greek anti defamation league wedding feels a bit anachronistic  still  not every low budget movie must be quirky or bleak  and a happy ending is no cinematic sin though likable  its stock brand of comedy makes  meet the parents  look like a magnum opus of comic achievement by comparison as a witness to several greek american weddings    but  happily  a victim of none    i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms  vardalos  memories and insights this romantic comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea  this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool this is a very funny  heartwarming film  it has fun with the quirks of family life  but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect even if you can t pronounce  gyro  correctly  you ll appreciate much of vardalos  humor  which transcends ethnic boundaries my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year  it s also a    dare i say it twice    delightfully charming    and totally american  i might add    slice of comedic bliss as toula  the frump who blossoms into a flower  nia vardalos delivers a lovely performance it s as warm as a double shot of ouzo  as exotic as chicken lemon soup and as sweet as a plate of honey dripped baklava my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as  a perfect family film   because it s about family it s a sweet  laugh a minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth will toula have an enormous  boisterous and eccentric family  absolutely  will ian s parents be the most uptight white people this side of a  saturday night live  skit  of course  will love conquer all in the end  you bet one of the funniest  most joyous comedies to come along since the greeks invented comedy if you come from a family that eats  meddles  argues  laughs  kibbitzes and fights together  then go see this delightful comedy vardalos is amicable and sincere  but without the assembly of mutton munching caricatures  this romantic comedy would be hard pressed to fill a wedding gown  there is so much goodwill here  you are charmed as much as tickled into laughing if viewers aren t looking for anything remotely sophisticated and don t mind the broad  repetitive comedy or potentially offensive stereotypes  they might just find themselves enjoying this lightweight film    to some degree a comfortable and comforting film with pep and heart and charm enough to overcome its simplicities and deficiencies despite its flaws  the movie leaves you feeling good  which is about all it aspires to what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low key way of tackling what seems like done to death material while this modest film certainly isn t the equal of monsoon wedding in humor  insight or character development  it is fun the comedy works thanks to vardalos  plucky humor and a genial cast a textbook example of how keeping it simple can yield big rewards    and big laughs the material is presented with so much warmth and affection  it s almost impossible to resist this is an affectionate and good hearted movie that could ve been a whole lot better and could ve been a whole lot worse a delectable confection it uses an old time formula  it s not terribly original and it s rather messy    but you just have to love the big  dumb  happy movie my big fat greek wedding a fun ride the story feels stale and the characters     sink too often to sketch comedy stereotypes it s a rare treat when a film comes along that satirizes such a unique and passionate culture vardalos is ingratiating  but ultimately not distinctive enough to truly hold your interest with its thin premise and stereotypical characters  a better title would have been a big fat waste of time feels like an extended pilot in search of a weekly tv slot the movie is rigged for payoffs more linear than the parthenon in its prime it s a buoyant comedy with more warmth and generosity of spirit than anything else in theaters right now vardalos apparently never met an ethnic stereotype she didn t like  and she s got a million of them the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor it s warm  sweet and funny fluff under joel zwick s lackluster direction  the humor mostly comes across as too broad or simply flat warm hearted in the way a movie can be when it knows its people inside out delivers a sugar rush without the calories the avalanche of family     is a hoot and a half a robust romantic comedy filled with high spirits and a celebration of ethnicity unfunny standard issue ethnic mix  em up an amiable  offhanded comedy about ethnic identity and last chance romance the result is a rare delight  a romantic comedy that s both deeply romantic and very funny there s such a good natured heart beating beneath the cliches that it s easy to appreciate the film s willingness to poke gentle fun without a whiff of nastiness or judgment sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick  it s a sitcom without the snap crackle so good natured and life loving  and vardalos  toula is so quick witted and adorable  that we have little problem understanding why ian would want to get in on the fun tres greek writer and star nia vardalos has crafted here a worldly wise and very funny script it looks more like a film designed for the small screen  but  like toula  is has a good natured personality vardalos s parodies of greek family values are loving and witheringly hilarious like vardalos and corbett  who play their roles with vibrant charm  the film  directed by joel zwick  is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can t fake an entertaining and good spirited romance that celebrates the marvelous possibilities of life  don t be surprised if you find yourself dancing out of the theater a comedy that  if not exactly a gutbuster  is one that is consistently charming  and that is due to the fresh voice and presence of writer star nia vardalos nannanit s simplistic to a fault and the humour is only slightly racier than a typical saturday morning cartoon  but it does all of those things with effort and conviction benefits from a good voice cast  bright and beautiful animation  and very funny and charming moments  it still falls back into those traps you see in so many bad animated films   unnecessary dance sequences  the pop culture references and catchphrases that are two years to late and using real world music in a fantasy world of birds  the birds are cute  but an unambitious storytelling sans twists and turns  makes this bird watching unexciting if not tedious  the screenplay lacks depth and so does the conflict between characters if you re an accompanying adult  be rest assured  there s plenty of chuckles in it for you too  it s a real egg citing film    could have been worse   full review in spanish i m sorry they couldn t have relied more on the birdbrains at their disposal for a smarter story than a multimillion dollar  volatile pun fest angry birds could have been an unmitigated disaster  and it was a big relief to see that it didn t even come close to that it s lushly animated  genuinely hilarious at times and even comes with the all important message about speaking up for what you believe in would have been terrible even if it managed to come out during the period of time when society might have been interested in it  instead  it s both terrible and deeply pathetic the film launches a barrage of avian and porcine puns  plus a flock of knowing pop culture references    most of these will fly right over the heads of younger viewers  but the film s rambunctious silliness will go down a treat so now even social apps are being turned into feature films  at this rate  should we expect internet meme  the movie next the angry birds movie gets the job done  but there are strange tonal shifts here and a surprising amount of off color jokes the angry birds movie is really not bad  it is actually very actively okay  the film has taken its bird brained brand    and used it to construct characters and plots that are certainly serviceable  and possibly even inspired the angry birds movie is childish and occasionally cute and capitalises on the game s once addictive popularity it s hardly anything about which to raise your eyebrows inside out  this is not    the most constructive outlet for anger is a violent bombing of the birds  adversaries  as if ted cruz s foreign policy advisor wrote the screenplay  angry birds  never really takes flight  families of all ages deserve a lot better than this fitfully floppy   but sony profits are flying high a frenetic kids  film that is chock full of madcap energy  throwaway sight gags and very silly puns  angry birds should most please those who are willing to relinquish their cynicism and go with the flow every ounce of the angry birds movie is a mimicry and mockery of something greater that came before it  not an instant classic  but it s fun and enjoyable like an amusement park ride   full review in spanish it s interesting how it incorporates the game dynamic into the story in a creative way   full review in spanish kids deserve better than a long drawn out animated scene of a bald eagle urinating in to a lake that our characters just drank from moments ago sarcastically  subversively funny  and all set within a surprisingly creative universe where three dimensionally fluffy birds inhabit turquoise beaches and wonky houses that make you think of dr  seuss by way of montego bay films based on video games have not set a very high bar in the past    the angry birds movie is at least unlikely to ruffle your feathers or have you blowing up in anger it could ve been much  much worse  but that doesn t necessarily mean it s any good   full review in spanish it captures a lot of what s so enjoyable about the mobile app  which is really all it needs to do there s not enough here for a full length feature film   something that becomes obvious the longer the movie is on the screen it feels like something dali would have dreamed up after imbibing a bottle of absinthe and choking on a ham sandwich despite fleeting moments of entertainment  the angry birds movie comes across as a hollow viewing experience that doesn t have much to offer   even for kids when all is said and done   angry birds  probably should have just been left in your pocket while pixar s masterfulness is found in the subtlety of their approach  the angry birds movie goes for broke in a more visceral approach  packing in pop culture references bound to go over any child s head  no matter how precocious angry birds could be gonzo  instead  it s just kinda    there silly  frenetic  sometimes crude  toon based on popular app the plot is pretty simple  the real question is can it entertain the kids  and the answer depends on how receptive your children are to gyrating dance sequences set to covers of old pop standards movies based on video games continue to earn their wretched reputation  and i m afraid the angry birds movie won t do anything to change that i ve never played the game  hopefully it s more fun  not even sean penn s grunts can save this stinker  oddly targeted at younger viewers  many of whom may not have been the game s first crop of power players  this animated feature could prove to introduce them birds to a whole new generation  might not be the most original and novel way to convert a game and its characters into a movie  but it can be funny most of the time both children and adults will delight in the way the destruction of the pigs  island amplifies the joys of the original game  the effect is an amusing reversal of cultural recognition as the role of the icons expands through reproduction    the angry birds movie  is about as filling as the game itself  and has little to say other than friendship is good  pigs are bad  and angry payback is best of all even though  anger is not always the answer   sometimes it has to be  or there s no movie  and here s where the angry birds movie will divide audiences seeing an animated film in a theatre full of children and never hear them laughing is an indicator that something s wrong   full review in spanish parents will come out as angry as the titular birds of this one   full review in spanish bright and cheerful  but under plotted and overproduced  a chaotic yet amusing tale of animated avians battling plundering pigsthe game  angry birds   at its core  is a destination for switching off your brain  and movies  even throw away summer animated kid films  should aim for something more the kids of today deserve better  so do i  come to think of it game over ticket buying adults shouldn t just be angry  they should punch the filmmakers the moral of angry birds is that it s fine    even necessary and virtuous    to be angry  to rage  and to destroy  have fun explaining that one to the kids the angry birds movie is exactly what one expects from a movie based on a video gaming app  and so much less if the very idea of an angry birds movie feels about four years too late  know that it also has a joke about gluten overall the film s a long play of a video game barely propped up by plot and stock personalities distinctly earthbound   neither bad enough to make you furious nor good enough to be memorable after paying good money to take your family to see this film  you may be dealing with some anger management issues of your own i admit i fell victim to many a belly laugh watching the angry birds movie  i loved sudeikis  and penn s performances the humor is all over the place  it s a film that hopes that shaking a pig s butt or drinking pee filled water will get the easy laughs from the youngest viewers while the adults in the audience count the second until they can leave kids will revel in its bright  dumb fun  even if adults will be disappointed that its terrific ensemble weren t given more to work with an oppressive onslaught of noises and colors  occasionally punctuated by a joke again and again  angry birds returns to the well  assuming that imitating the way other cartoons look  or making a goofy noise  will cause something funny to just kind of happen the angry birds movie  is unnecessary but cute  like a bonnet on a cat   and there are certainly worse recommendations than that the occasionally amusing puns and over talented voice cast don t compensate enough for the meager story and the haphazard morals aimed at indiscriminating children it s an off the rack cgi animated effort that wastes considerable vocal talent on a tired concept  only content to gift fans what they expect  and nothing more goes through familiar  harmless and occasionally amusing plot motions to explain why these birds are so angry  and why they re perfectly justified in going bin laden on buildings repackaged way past the time when the game was a peak obsession  this animated joyride is still an irresistible invitation to shake your sillies out  the movie s story  by john cohen  is pretty thin gruel  but jon vitti s smart aleck script can be quite funny  and the brightly colored animation is appealing a entertaining story full of jokes and funny moments   full review in spanish whereas you only needed a single finger to play the game  not one brain cell is required to process this busy  fizzy  empty calorie calamity the jaunty story has enough kinetic energy to keep young audiences engaged  and it remains truthful to the anarchic spirit of the game on which it is based while it s a disappointment compared to a lot of other animated films  it s not entirely bad the angry birds movie  is just fowl the angry birds movie is a lot of things  but none of them true to the app s appeal irrelevant animated film that comes out when angry birds isn t even popular anymore   full review in spanish it should come as no surprise that the angry birds movie is a loud and dumb children s film  but for what it s worth  there are plenty of cinematic commercial ventures that are louder and dumber and so on than the well meaning and slickly sold birds it s not the worst thing out there  but the running time is too much and more than just curiosity doesn t really hold up as a great movie   full review in spanish  angry birds  proves to be more than just a gimmick  and doesn t skimp on any of the quirky wackiness that you might expect from a film about blob shaped  flightless birds battling pigs instead of elevating the angry birds concept to surreal heights of insane genius  the filmmakers settle for a tale bogged down by familiar themes plucked from much better films it s not entirely mindless fun on the level of the game  but it is just simple  goofy entertainment ultimately  the angry birds movie does a decent job exploring the merits of anger  it s no inside out  but it has heart and life  which isn t too shabby for any film    app or not    don t take your children to sit and lose hour and a half of their lives you won t get back  you ve been warned   full review in spanish the angry birds movie plays best to children who are easily entertained  but even they deserve better than this there is still plenty of whimsy  colour and slapstick comedy present in the angry birds movie to keep the adults relatively entertained and the kiddies    who are more than likely to be the most entertained    giddy with joy what the heck is this  some sort of meninist political statement attempting to vindicate male anger  in a kids  movie  maybe men shouldn t make movies   what  the angry birds movie is about is better than how it s about it never once transcends expectations  instead perpetuating our initial apprehensions related to the project    feels a little haphazard and undercooked   as a film  the angry birds movie is an okay kids  flick  no more no less  but as a video game adaptation it is actually remarkably well done for the record  my eight year old son gave it five stars this simply isn t funny enough to charm the parents of the film s intended audience  impressionable and not particularly discerning children a fast  funny  deliriously silly  breezy piece of animated folly   far too low brow for pixar  far too dragon free for dreamworks    a phone app turned into a fun family film  makes you glad you lived this long pretty animation  weak jokes and a message that feels downright sinister  the humour thrives primarily off of the kookiness of its characters the film is so random that it can t help but get the audience laughing i m sure that playing the game for an hour is much more fun than this movie   full review in spanish it pulls off what has hitherto seemed an impossible feat  staying true to the spirit of the video game on which it was based  and simultaneously  breathing new life into the concept the angry birds movie has becomed what could easilly be a ver proftable movie franchise   fiull review in spanish the angry birds movie has a lot of poop jokes  fun  and pop culture references  but it does it going out of common places  which is something we can appreciate   full review in spanish this videogame adaptation is a little more than an acceptable family film   full review in spanish the angry birds franchise keeps growing and now it does so with splendid animation and the funny and explosive shennanigans of the characters of the game   full review in spanish it s visually pleasing  but after the first minutes it becomes a dull and lifeless adventure that get tiresome quickly   full revew in spanish jokes come thick and fast in a film that plays to the cheap seats but may bewilder the younger viewers at whom it s presumably aimed i laughed more during the angry birds movie than i have at any film for a while animation veterans fergal reilly and clay kaytis ensure this skittles coloured universe is never less than zippy  but it s the cast that makes the movie the plot is rudimentary but the visuals are pleasing enough to get through some of the quieter patches a freewheeling film that winds up celebrating the need to be true to yourself we discover what made the phone app angry birds incandescent with rage in the angry birds movie  repurposed for children in this cheerfully ironic adaptation while this is strictly for kids  it s bright  bold and soon  er  flies by this is surprisingly fun  with loveable characters an animated tale that s a million miles from the irreverent brilliance of the lego movie  but mercifully still more than a bare minimum cash grab while it s maybe more fun for spring chickens  the angry birds movie does a lot with a flimsy premise the angry birds movie is quite good fun a great videogame adaptation with zany humor and good animation   full review in spanish pretty much meets egg spectations of an absurd bird game plucked from an app and served up on the big screen a collection of gags that come together in a feel good finale  rather than a cohesive story  the angry birds movie still has its moments  some of which may have you chuckling for days adults won t feel that angry at having seen it afterwards  while the little ones will be amused angry birds is    really sorry about this one    a hoot it s buoyantly paced  and has just enough sincerity about its feathered society to keep you from sneaking glances down at whatsapp pulling off a commendable movie version of the game was always going to be a difficult task  no matter how good the graphics or the one liners  in the end  it s the target audience that really matters whatever we might think of its broader implications  in the end  the angry birds movie is basically a franchise extender that follows a predictable formula a brash  sarcastic just about family friendly adventure     about as entertaining as avian flu while not quite on the level of the lego movie  this is an energetic and entertaining adventure that won t ruffle the feathers of any dragged along adults the sheer contrived ridiculousness is part of the fun  but you really do have to know the game a lighthearted and entertaining romp even when the feather light plot gets into a freeform flap  the trade off is an energised kind of knowing  anarchic playfulness  the sort that favours spewed up bird food gags over vomit inducing homilies i got a chuckle out of the corny throw away visual puns    but much of the film seems too loud  too fast and too hard to follow for its target market of kiddies  hell  it was tough for me  tooit is cute and colourful  but a bit too crass   not withstanding its excellent animation and production elementsas silly and disposable as the video game that inspired it    but nowhere near as addictive     the angry birds movie  is fitfully funny but tends towards a madcap mixture of comedy and action that never develops much forward momentum the animation punches well above its weight with properly looney tunes standard sight gags  polished  highly expressive character design  and rendering so intensely computed nearly every barbule and rachis on each individual feather is visible the angry birds movie is both the equivalent of a screaming five year old and a regressive piece of american propaganda let s be clear  then  the angry birds movie isn t pointless because it s based on an app  it s pointless because it s pointless a fast  fizzy and frenetically entertaining extension of the manic gaming franchise that  at its zenith  had children of all ages glued to their smartphone screens treats its audience as a friend  inviting one and all to share in the fun  the dialogue  as atrocious as it is  is recited knowing wholeheartedly the very audience sharing the joke on the other side of the screen a minor film on this sort of scale is always a major gesture the expendables is more than just your average action movie  it is the action movie of the year uniting the grittiness and soul of the old genre with the special effects and coolness of the new genre  see it trust me   there s  a scene you need to witness with a crowd that whoops and cheers  which is really what this film demands of its audience throughout some kind of meatheaded masterpiece  it s cinematic junk food of the highest order  what the expendables does right is it caters to its fans  it knows exactly what they want and it delivers a a pure  adrenaline fuelled thrill ride with some great action the action scenes are huge and excessively violent on a scale not seen since the closing scenes of commando  at one point  in the absence of any buildings to detonate or ammunition depots to destroy  i think i saw an explosion explode what we end up with is an incomprehensible  overly long explosion fest that could have easily been retitled  a d d   the motion picture the kind of all out  over the top action movie they just don t make anymore  which is probably a good thing because the human brain can only take a movie that provides the equivalent to getting three consecutive adrenaline shots so many times i like the idea of this movie much more than how it actually turned out this has been clearly aimed at   pardon the pun   diehard action film fans  anyone else  who might expect a vague sense of irony  will be sorely disappointed     it s a little like meeting up with old friends  only to come away deflated  realising you just don t have that much to talk about any more stallone  with his highly unusual current face  is so busy making googly eyes at statham and nursing a man crush that he forgets that the goal of this movie is more killing if you are a connoisseur of the steven seagal flavor of direct to dvd action film  seeing all these guys up on screen actually is a lot of fun  it doesn t make it a good movie by any stretch of the imagination  but it s still a lot of fun the rest of the mayhem is simply ultraviolent  nonstop  and numbing  better jokes might have helped unnatural but kind of remarkable provides a decent  if not totally fulfilling  fix of that something we miss     a perfectly enjoyable mercenaries on a mission of redemption adventure with a mix of testosterone fueled camaraderie and this time it s personal seriousness suitable for a night of cold beer  chili  and a hot woman at your side   the film s climax delivers and delivers and just keeps topping itself  making it possibly the most satisfying experience since cheeseburgers after a very big night final notes  this is a movie in which dolph lundgren is expected to convincingly portray a junkie and have an american accent  also  jet li plays a character called yin yang  do with this information what you will if the plot line doesn t leave you numb with disbelief  the excessive explosive outbursts and viscerally edited dismemberments will drop you  or someone you care about  wet in the seat it s fun to see this aging cast together on screen  but the movie is junk  the one liners aren t funny  the dialogue is tedious  and the action itself is prosaic and repetitive how many actions stars does it take to get audiences into theaters  this many the entertaining action scenes are as weighty and gnarly as the actors  grizzled mugs wow  i haven t seen this much over the hill action since don ameche and hume cronyn did laps in cocoon the expendables is admirable for bringing these actors all together  but shameful for not having the integrity to do anything of value with them humble  subtle and restrainedwe can understand the need to have a support group for elderly action heroes who want to relive the glory years  but did they have to release it as a film  unnecessary except for  youngster  jason statham  stallone s band of geriatric heroes are pretty creaky what we get is pure  unadulterated b movie stuff  with an a budget the action sequences are terrific  the violence excessive  the guiltiest of guilty pleasures  then unless you ve got a burning desire to see some old timers trying to turn back the clocks and running around in a film they know in their heart of hearts is more at home on the small screen  wait for the dvd offers up neither clearly delineated characters nor any fundamental character of its own that the supporting cast really needn t have bothered showing up is the closest stallone gets to a decent joke nothing exceeds like excess in the expendables thick necked and hollow headed and weirdly affectingthe expendables is like dating a jock   no sparkling conversation or subtlety but great to have around when you need to blow sh t up or kick some ass misses many opportunities to truly exploit its old school ethos  instead falling into the trap of hyper edited incoherencesomething about the large scope of the action confounds stallone  and his excessively large number of unit directors  it s too hectic  too confusing to be cool  or exhilirating is it that big a deal to have a cast that includes steve austin  randy couture and terry crews  these guys would line up for a straight to dvd american pie sequel if asked stallone s dozens of remaining fans know exactly what to expect  and he gives it to them good and hard  botched sensitivity aside  the expendables delivers epic action not since rocky worked out in a meat locker has sylvester stallone surrounded himself with so much aging beef stallone  never a clear speaker  spends most of his time grunting like a gloucester old spot or barking like a sea lion with a sore throat after repeated taunts to  bring it   increasing evidence of the barely there story  and a war s worth of bullets and fireballs  the expendables gets pretty tiresome  it s an a grade cast all right  but there s no escaping that this is a b movie drenched in adrenaline  veiled in violence   the expendables  really is  expendable  i mean the worst action film of the year  and that s saying something in which a bunch of macho has beens and never weres splash down in the action pond for one last go round the movie struggles to find a main attraction that s worth the bullets it s printed on quit it with the cgi blood spurts  exceeded my expectations as concerns dumbness    and my expectations were high  this movie actually goes beyond being merely dumb  it s more like the nirvana of dumbosity     delivers exactly what the coming attractions promise   a lot of over the top action and silliness    if you like watching men with no necks thumping each other  this could be your citizen kane the only reason to watch this film is to see some of the world s most famous action stars returning for one last bout of mayhem a piece of sclerotic all star machismo about as exciting as veterans  arm wrestling night at the hollywood bowl a film so unashamedly manly  it makes fight club look like the time they did single ladies on glee if you only see one action movie this year  see the expendables    twice full review at movies for the massesin lieu of a flurry of left hooks and roundhouse kicks  we stay safely in stallone s comfort zone of shoot  em ups and s    getting blown up  a  lumbering  aptly titled hulk of a movie an unstoppable throwback to the days of rambo and commando  a time when heroes cracked wise  shat bullets  and blew up a thousand faceless enemies before breakfast we want to remember  we want to revel  we want to watch things explode  stallone only understands one of these things  so yes  there will be explosions defensive and frankly more than a little patheticit looks like most of the money spent in this project went to explosions  which are many and huge  and to acting salaries  at the expense of special effects and the script  which could have used a big upgrade watching the expendables is like watching professional wrestling but with guns  knives and a whole lot of death flawed  but the action scenes are as violent  ridiculous and over the top as you could hope for big guns  big hats  big motorcycles  big trucks  there is obviously more being projected here than just a moviestallone s boasted that he s made the drunk uncle of all dumb action movies and in several ways he haswhatever film you ve imagined   is better than what the film actually is an overly hyped exercise  a cynical attempt to couple recognizable action stars with their respective muscles onscreen     think of this not so much a film but  rather  steroid abuse of a whole other kind glories in over the top  testosterone driven action and an ensemble whose names i only expected to hear when i died and went to b movie heaven  if only the expendables  script was as divine as its roll call there s a lot in this nostalgic sylvester stallone actioner that lives up to its title   the recycled plot  the forgettable characters  the monotonous violence   but it s an undeniable kick to see these vets in action with only a couple of artistic virtues and even fewer moral attributes to its credit    the expendables  is wretched despite some surprisingly decent performances  it just isn t as fun as it should be  but stallone does prove there s still some room left in the action genre for these titans  so let s why not  let s have another round for diehard action fans the explosions and car chases will be enough but for those looking for strong characters and plot development it will be lacking it passes for an average stallone film  which doesn t quite make it a good pic even though it s not exactly a bad pic too bad this blast from the past mucho macho male reunion movie is so absurdly incoherent it s like being in stallone s head watching his stream of consciousness manifest jean claude van damme and steven seagal will be kicking themselves   or perhaps each other   for having turned stallone down it s one of those movies best watched on dvd or blu ray where you can fast forward any time you see someone open their mouth to talk what you will find is both familiar in its contours and unique in its casting it s not the age of the actors that makes the expendables expendable  it s the stale storytelling an awful screenplay  horrible acting  and all action   fisticuffs  gun fights  car chases  etc    is badly edited  it s a terrible movie  i loved every cliche filled minute  it s all as dumb as mud  but it s familiar and comfortable enough to entertain on a basic level the expendables isn t as much fun as it should be i s a bit like a trip to the gym on a flat tire  the advertising materials    carry just the right kind of gleeful  confident attitude    but sadly  stallone s actual movie is a giant mess and a wasted opportunity the closest a real life movie has ever gotten to  seinfeld  s  death blow   sylvester stallone s gun emptying  blade tossing  clandestine action flick  the expendables  is great fun  sure  this declaration comes with caveats  but do you really need to hear them if ever there was a movie that was all about the action scenes  the expendables is it the world has changed since rambo and arnold held sway  which isn t the film s fault  but it s going to be held accountable anyway also the predictables  the forgettables and they kinda look like the anabolic steroidables   the expendables delivers a series of macho encounters within the team of expert killers and pointedly named hard asses if you accept the expendables for what it is    stallone having some simple  stupid fun    you may be surprised to find yourself joining him there s nothing wrong with a guilty pleasure  we all have them  those movies that we know suck that we can t help but watch on cable every time they come on  but they still suck  bullets  knives and bare hands fly in an incomprehensible vortex as arms and heads and body parts get thrown into the melee stallone is a terrible action director  sequences are visually incoherent  chopped up  sloppy  vague  you d think that in all the years he s spent in this racket he would ve learned how to cobble together stuff like this hulk like  expendables   it smash  guns go bang bang  things go boom  fire everywhere  cars crash and make even more fire  ha ha ha  hulk no like rourke  though  rourke nuts the expendables should have been the greatest action movie ever made  unfortunately  the film is a bit underwhelming  luckily  crews and statham save the day there s no one to blame but stallone for action sequences that degenerate into incoherence  to the point where it s impossible to know who s truck is exploding and who s shooting at whom while stallone s film won t win any oscars  it gives off a dopey genre high that s hard not to catch given the similarities between the two films    the muddled fight scenes  the occasional one liners  the over the top violence  used to camouflage the narrative weaknesses    this easily could have been titled rambo v this is truly a movie that nobody needs    gratuitously savage  implausible and sometimes incoherent occasionally fun in its over the top mindlessness  the fun just never lasts more than a couple minutes at a time a down and dirty action adventure  and the best escapist entertainment around  check your brain at the door for non stop rowdy  riotous and raucous fun  as with rambo  we get bullets that cause heads to literally explode  that should have been the tone all along  but stallone just can t let his movie be terrible enough to be entertaining  when the expendables revs up and becomes the loud  explosive machismo parade that it s meant to be  it works  but when it doesn t  it s rather abysmal but that feeling quickly disappears thanks to the movie s awfulness  and by the time it was over the only excitement i still felt was the supreme joy of finally being able to leave the theatre and head back home it pretty much fits the bill    maybe not directed with any particular verve or wit by stallone  but still satisfactory of the lowest common denominators and the highest possible decibel levels like the gosford park of bad acting  this is one throwback that should have been thrown back the whole enterprise is a tremendous wasted opportunity  even the title knows it among the explosions and the blood  a forceful melancholy infects the characters and puts a dark tinge to even the most jocular banter feels less like high concept filmmaking and more like wishful thinking the fights are so many and so long and the cuts so quick that you can rarely tell who s winning  one thing is certain  the losers are the viewers friends may not let friends die alone  but bogus philosophizing is apparently business as usual alas  little money was left over to fund the screenplay  which is unbelievably bad given the level of talent involved you certainly can t say this over the top thriller skimps on action  the final third or so is wall to wall brawling  shootings and explosions these action heroes take their fun seriously without taking themselves seriously  while you may have trouble figuring out who s running where in the film s big climax  stallone sets off enough explosions to ensure their brazilian shooting location could be seen from space best action film of the summerthe audiences for whom  the expendables  represents a wish belatedly fulfilled aren t expecting shakespeare  but stallone  once an oscar nominated screenwriter  is strictly on autopilot here  delivers pretty much exactly what its audience wants and expects  big  dumb  campy fun so deliriously  comically macho  it s remarkable that no one in the cast died of testosterone poisoning  it s willfully out of date  like an aging hair band that can t pack away the spandex borrows liberally from such male bonding classics as robert aldrich s the dirty dozen and sam peckinpah s the wild bunch  but offers not a whiff of the tragic fatalism and astute critique of machismo that inform those superior dramas it yawningly snaps into place as yet another series of explosions that are dressed up with no place to blow the film bulls eyes so bad it s sad from the get go  the precision with which it just keeps hitting that unwanted target is spooky     what winds up in the picture s largely lazy grasp is largely evidence of the influence of  well  any number of cheap and often straight to video testosterone fests expendables is the closest thing to movie viagra yet invented  it s reprehensible  it s stoopid violent  it s a lot of unholy fun unfortunately  there s a limit to the effectiveness of this kind of influence the big set piece at the end is impressive   proving that stallone really is a formidable action director  it is just a pity it takes so long to get there  it s a contender for the manliest movie ever made as an opportunity for giant lunkheads to knock each other around and blow things up  the expendables is considerably more fun than the last transformers movie is it fun  sort of  but it shoulda coulda been a ton of fun when it gets around to the righteous fightin  and killin  bits  the expendables more than delivers on its promise to be the manliest movie ever made it s not just the characters who are expendable  the actors may as well be tossed out with the garbage  too sure  it s fun  after a fashion  to see them all in the same place  kicking and creaking  but that s about all it is a throat slashing  elbow dropping  grenade throwing  trigger pulling  and limb dismembering good time the shootouts are epic  but the stuff leading up to them is lame inevitably  the film culminates in a nearly wordless bloodbath with a death every few seconds  plunging onward like the world s longest drum solo the body count is enormous  the explosions deafening  and none of it makes sense    so why did i find this such a guilty pleasure stallone encourages a pure bath of brutality  sans winks  it s up to the viewer to decide if this is all disgusting overkill or the cinematic equivalent of a firm erection as for stallone  he grimaces purposefully in his el greco beard  and he keeps the body count coming so that it sates you like a junk food craving fulfilled give me bradley cooper driving a tank in mid air  any day the thought behind this body splattering nostalgia trip is unformed and stagnant the expendables is third rate this is action as timeless as the reptilian brain fathers  don t let your sons grow up without the expendables taken as a whole  the expendables is a disappointment  and a frustrating one at that the expendables is preaching to the choir  but that choir will surely lap it up with relish gratuitous explosions  fight scenes and macho stars past and present  this is the pick of this year s cluttered action crop the expendables is savage yet inert  and breathtakingly sleazy in its lack of imagination i d say that i already can smell the sequel  but i believe that odor is coming from this film stallone vs  hugo chavez  c mon  the general wears the very same trademark fatigues and red beret  and heads a latin american country beginning with a  v  and ending with an  a   while the former overturns papaya carts and terrorizes donkeys stallone and crew deliver a hard hitting  unrepentant action extravaganza lean  mean  funny  and chockablock with fast twitch demolition spectacle   the expendables  represents a grand finale for several generations of action cinema stars  sly stallone has corralled the meanest  toughest action actors he could find and pooled them into a turbo charged dirty dozen movie  with laughs it s raining bullets and knives in this macho action thriller in which brute force rules supreme  it s a bitter pill to swallow  but it s a dark day indeed when a film can bring together so many promising elements and  when the curtains close  leave you wondering exactly what the heck you just sat through    and if you even enjoyed it at all it s not particularly well made  but the patchiness only adds to the considerable goodwill and charm the movie carries the gun show is in full effect in the expendables  an old school action ensemble tailor made for our nostalgic times one shouldn t knock the plotting for being distinctly old school  but criticism deserves to be levelled at the manner in which so much talent is squandered it s filled with literally explosive excitement  stallone s retro actioner is a cheesy  schlocky anachronistic flick  sort of a class reunion of the genre s stars of the past two decades a bunch of guys past their prime punching and kicking each other and pretending its for our benefit  when its really just one last self congratulatory hurrah the body count is high and the personalities click in this old school testosterone fest take the cast away  and there s not much more here than the straight to dvd schlock that has kept conspicuously absent rivals steven seagal and jean claude van damme busy of late nannanon one hand the movie is a game  a conscious display    of spielberg s technical mastery  on the other it reaches toward what might be prophecy  or passionate allegory  or exhortation to mindfulness of real human suffering the story is affecting  the action scenes are thrilling  the issues are resonant  an unstoppable juggernaut of action and anxiety that will have you blundering from the cinema in a state of nervous exhaustion  don t expect any soft drink promotional tie ins with this summer blockbuster war of the worlds is that most rare of screen adaptations   a film that is faithful to its origins and at the same time  its own separate creature  the first half is better than the second  but what a first half alien invasion thriller too scary for young kids so impressive in so many ways that it makes the frustration over its miserable final moments that much harder to bear   in its own right it works well enough most of the time to pass an entertaining couple of hours an exciting  intense  gruesome  and awfully subversive piece of science fiction escapism   see it  but lower your expectations great flick from spielbergspielberg blows stuff up better than anyone    he proves himself the maestro of that by now degraded game just when it seemed like mr  spielberg might be maturing into a filmmaker with some much needed cynicism  you realize he s still just out there rounding up the dollars spielberg flips the e t  script with this sci fi flick which reverts to the pulp fiction notion of aliens as the enemies of earthlings reconfirms spielberg as a master of action  here seamlessly integrating spectacular visual magic into the most mundane and familiar settings like disasters in real life  the film hits you in the gut with a vision of catastrophe  and leaves you to sort out what it all means spielberg creates an alien invasion movie that can be labelled the antithesis to the likes of independence day or the ilk  the reason  the personal perspective the film is dark and bleak with little real sense of wonder  the thing that should be spielberg s forte click to read review  greek the film succeeds as pure sensation  an exacting distillation of fear steven spielberg s war of the worlds is huge and scary  moving and funny another capper to a career that seems like an unending succession of captivations rarely has the term  hollywood ending  been quite as appropriate  and seldom has a denouement of that nature come so close to tainting all that came before spielberg s worlds is filled with terrific scenes but ultimately  he draws the film to a predictable and utterly disappointing conclusion a basic rule of thumb is   if you see tim robbins  you ve stayed too long there likely won t be a more gripping film this year than spielberg s war of the worlds  which at its best glides along like choreography with a camera  slowly parsing out information while shrouding the rest in shadow and suggestion  a s much a disaster movie as it is a straight sci fi horror film     there are very good performances in the film     but the movie leaves you feeling let down and quarrelsome  i liked it a lot  aside from the ending  which made me want to burn down the theater just as jaws made us fear the water  wotw makes us wary of the weather  you ll never again look at lightning in quite the same way an adrenaline pumping disaster movie told within the context of a small scale family drama     is an entertaining thrill ride all summer blockbusters should be as loud and scary    and deliver    like this  until its final act  the film is lean and alive  a visceral thrill ride designed to move audiences to the edge of their seats or maybe into their parents  laps  war of the worlds shows that steven spielberg remains one of the best shooters in hollywood the narrative miscalculation is extraordinary and ruinous to the extent that i can t conjure an example of a similarly enjoyable movie being beheaded so efficiently war of the worlds is thoughtful  but don t let that worry you  this is an action film concerned more with delivering thrills than making bold statements wotw is a great film and entertainment that can be taken seriously  shyamalan and emmerich must be quietly shaking their fists  realizing he still does it better overall  the film is too lacking in feeling to provide a recognizably human experience the movie is the anti independence day  the aliens are kicking our butts and we can t do anything but wait for our turn to become kibble it s worth every penny     a visual and technical achievement  but underwhelming on every other level it doesn t work as a science fiction epic  it doesn t work as a tale of families bonding in the face of tragedy  and it certainly doesn t work as a mingling of the two you don t think a walking tripod can be scary don t expect reese s pieces or mashed potatoes to be on the menu in spielberg s shock and awesome version of wells it s a thrilling ride    but  this bountiful pot of signifiers leaves a caustic aftertaste  a thrilling but frivolous ride war of the worlds is taut  gripping and surprisingly dark filmmaking i just thought it was unrealistic when they killed the aliens with a chemical imbalance  because we all know there s no such thing as a chemical imbalance spielberg remains the consummate storyteller  even if the material he has chosen to work with simply doesn t pack the emotional wallop of a  schindler s list       an impressive display of sound and fury that falls apart the minute any scrutiny is applied to the machinations of its plot war  what is it good for  absolutely nothing but a good couple of hours at the theater what hurts it is spielberg s dogged insistence on turning it into yet another of his seemingly endless middle brow meditations on the travails of the middle class family whether it represents filmmaking at its most opportunistic or most empathic will be up to each viewer to decide  but there s no denying its potency as a harrowing thrill ride imagine jurassic park handled with the sorrow and doom of schindler s list  it s the most terrifying movie in ages bewildered  mildly optimistic  holding out the hope of salvation in spite of everything in a blasted  empty landscape  war of the world is  in the end  and perhaps despite its intentions  a fairly tentative assertion of hope for the future surprisingly dark for a blockbuster and delivers handsomely in terms of thrills and special effects if you ve seen independence day  then you ve seen war of the worlds war of the worlds is pure popcorn escapism of the highest order if you want it to be  or more  but it s never less than thrilling war of the worlds is a terrifying potential vision of our own self inflicted doomsday  masquerading as a summer blockbuster spielberg has crafted a genuinely traumatic summer event movie  one that gives us images of violence and destruction of often devastating emotional weightan intense sci fi experience that should satisfy viewers who crave both expensive special effects and intimate human drama  assuming that such an audience exists as it is  i admire the brilliance of the majority of this picture to no end  it s just that pesky literal ending i walked out wanting to declare war on almost every moment of war of the worlds is heart racing  jaw dropping  knuckle biting  date grabbing adrenaline the real strength of the film is how closely spielberg welds it to ray and his family the story may be sci fi  but the product is a horror film  plain and simple  a brilliantly constructed scaring machine it s as if the aliens landed and everyone died so that tom cruise could grow up one more time war of the worlds ends too abruptly  running out of juice just as the aliens do  even on summer popcorn terms  it s a tepid finish to a movie that  for its first hour or so  taps so expertly into our fears  b y far the biggest  loudest and most elaborate adaptation of the h g  wells classic spielberg s list of great movies is too long to catalog here  but rest assured  war of the worlds now ranks among them spielberg as hobbesian  wells as eugenicisthow refreshing to see spielberg rock the boat with nothing more shocking than pure old fashioned fear    director steven spielberg has brought the story to this generation  and it is a story meant for this time   i m the pre teen maggie smith   says dakota fanning   if maggie smith had a stripper name      spielberg has a genius for     audience adulationit s really amazing how much pathos is generated while there s nothing on screen but violence and mass panic falls way short on ideas  character development  and creative wondermentyou could do a whole lot worse if you re looking through generic science fiction or disaster movies  but steven spielberg s standards are usually much higher than this ho hum story  generic fireworks the man who gave human dimension to the effects of holocaust in schindler s list has now prostituted human extermination for entertainment  bread and circuses  indeed people will nit pick at the plot and the script    but you can t look at what spielberg has put together in the first two thirds of this film and not be humbled and amazed only a master film maker could squeeze white knuckle terror out of an old war horse like h g  wells   war of the worlds what comes next is a prolonged look at unthinkable devastation  structured as one family s troubled dynamics this sense of constant anxiety is the most potent effect of the film spielberg seldom gives cruise  not to mention the audience  a break from the unstoppable peril of merciless invasion forget the story and go for the ride   war of the worlds  is a great summer thriller it may be no coincidence the president s poll numbers and the movie industry s ticket sales are both in a slump  doom and gloom scenarios are playing out offscreen and on   the good parts are really good and the bad parts are really bad war of the worlds confronts the west s collective feelings of vulnerability but at the same time it reassures our potential for survival never before has spielberg so tragically shot himself in the foot with his ending and never before have i been so willing to forgive most of the film is utterly terrifying  on that level  spielberg has succeeded totally    where the film runs into problems is in the overall pacing and structure there s not much plot  depth or character development  but it more than makes up for it in relentless intensity and consistency of vision generates chills through eerie  ambient sounds  slow panning camera shots and pants pissingly scared characters       a nerve gripping  full throttle rollercoaster ride for all its technical beauty  there s something lacking  it often feels a bit like spielberg phoned the film in or at the very least painted it by numbers  a  shockingly unimaginative remake the imagery is startling not just for its symbolic resonances  but for the breathless intensity with which it sears the screen the screenplay     is more intimate  eschewing a worldwide coverage of the invasion  this concept makes the calamity more immediate  more personal pitched at a level of interpersonal experience amid the mayhem  this blockbuster offers no sense of loss  given its ending  you d think the power had been out for a few days spielberg directs his early scenes with a vigorous and absolute sense of terror  the moment two youngsters appear more frightening than attacking aliens  you can t help suspecting there ll be additional moviemaking trouble ahead  and you re right my recommendation is tempered by the fact that this started off as a great movie and ended as little more than a piece of pleasant fluff an awesome summer movie that showcases a director and some actors at the top of their games     the inventor of the summer blockbuster directing the biggest movie star on the planet    it s big  it s loud  and it s what you expect an  event  film to be a sure footed thrill ride with more suspense and spine tingling scares than a tom cruise publicity junket let cruise rant and jump on furniture all he wants  so long as he can churn out movies like this one  he s free to make a fool of himself all he wants a brick breaking  glass shattering  emotion grabbing first half  stalls  then tailspins into a complete mess  ending is as bad as the openning is good we watch as neighborhoods and hordes of innocents are decimated  and the way it s shot   close in  with shaky  handheld cameras   makes you feel every death everybody wins with  war of the worlds   a fast paced summer blockbuster that will appeal to action  sci fi and drama fans be prepared for long intervals of holding your breath  because this is the real deal war of the worlds may not stand up well to careful inspection and it may not be the smartest science fiction film brought to the screen  but it is an intense  visceral experience an unwieldy hodgepodge of spectacular set pieces and sappy family drama the balancing act between pleasing crowds and evoking larger human truths eventually escapes spielberg s grasp  as it has occasionally in the past good naturedly bludgeons its audience with old fashioned alien invasion hysteria war of the worlds is an attack of the aliens disaster film crafted with sinister technological grandeur    a true popcorn apocalypse extravagant in movie terms but stingy in emotional ones  it embodies all of spielberg s bad impulses and almost none of his good ones war of the worlds  is a picture without a thought in its pretty head  the tom cruise movie to end all tom cruise movies an important film meticulously detailed and expertly paced and photographed  with sights so spectacular and terrible that viewers will have to consciously remind themselves to close their mouths when their jaws drop open technically flawless but not especially moving with the power of spielberg and cruise behind it  the sinister and tense war of the worlds is this summer s blockbuster to beat them all it s on the road that war of the worlds makes the jump from thrilling to frequently unpleasant  as spielberg burdens the movie with holocaust imagery and commentary about terrorism and wars of occupation urgent and pungent as powerful a filmmaker as he is  spielberg  with approximately two dozen features under his belt  remains a work in progress as a storyteller its exploitation of tragic iconography    just to amp up the screams  tug some tears and sell a few more million movie tickets    should be deplored this is one genuinely scary  disturbing movie spielberg shows that he remains the master of the form he virtually invented when it comes to searing and iconic visual imagery  spielberg is still the best filmmaker around steven spielberg s war of the worlds is a close encounter of the blurred kind  an orchestration of chaos and panic and destruction as visceral as it can get in terms of sheer spectacle alone  war of the worlds is a winner  if this movie doesn t help stop or turn around the box office slide of the past few months  then hollywood really is in big trouble it s the movies  ultimate disaster epic  a genuinely unsettling movie experience that uses the new technology to create an alien invasion of unprecedented scale and realism spielberg is pretty much incapable of making a terrible movie anymore  but he has plainly forgotten a lot of what makes a good popcorn movie since his jurassic period  where s the fun this disappointing war of the worlds limps to a conclusion that mercifully insures there will not be a sequel in the first two acts  the movie is rousing summer fare fantastic and banal  terrifying and occasionally dull  pure spielberg and yet at times anonymous  war of the worlds delivers multiple viewing experiences during its two hour running time    the film s only sublime moments happen in scenes where the population gets blown up war of the worlds is the kind of movie spielberg can make in his sleep  which may be why it feels like we are sleepwalking while watching it much is destroyed in steven spielberg s war of the worlds  but the movie never quite delivers an emotional knockout blow in his latest science fiction epic  director steven spielberg shows he s better at blowing up the world than anyone else alive  unfortunately  he also shows he has no idea how to put the world back together this is b movie material all the way  yet it s not only watchable  it s engrossing  that s because the material is in the hands of an a talent director  who knows  as few of his contemporaries do  how to manipulate the plastic qualities of a film wow  indeed in the second half of the film  the wind starts to go out of spielberg s sails war of the worlds can be a nightmarish trip  but it s a terrific film  a blockbuster that lives up to its billing a first class pop entertainment packed to the brim with astounding effects and near non stop action and suspense war of the worlds pushes some of the right buttons and enough of the wrong ones to make you wish that spielberg would move on from aliens already and use his unparalleled talents to focus once more on earth    wowing enough to silence rude  modern movie audiences in their seats the real hero of this film is steven spielberg  it s not the best spielberg film out there  but there are pieces of it that are truly monumental  spielberg is  in absolute visual  physical command of this material  presenting the complete chaos and destruction with frightening clarity war is a blast the ending fizzles    war should end in a victory that you can feel superior about and celebrate  it s close  but this encounter didn t rock my world earth goes to war  but spielberg merely goes back to his aging bag of tricks the definition of escapist summer movie and a triumph for director spielberg  it is a stunner and a half spielberg and his team are master filmmakers  and it s a pleasure to see them work a  wonder of contemporary  big budget hollywood filmmaking    it s its own antithesis at the same time it s a stunning example of it delivering much more than a sci fi extravaganza for the age of terrorism  spielberg keeps us rooting for a family facing danger from without and distress from within the title of the film is misleading  this is not a film about war  this is a movie about extermination w o w make e t  a bad dude whose momma never loved him and we re talking real scorched earth policy here     these guys are dividers  not uniters the first two acts are overpowering specimens of effects amped  screen incinerating hysteria it s refreshing for a change to see an apocalyptic vision that doesn t include shots of prominent world monuments being obliterated may give the kids nightmares but it won t turn on your  heartlight  some of the director s finest thriller style work in years there s plenty of blood  most of the cast of thousands die  and some of the images are just plain disturbing   i loved it stunning      fanning gives such an authentic portrayal of a terror stricken child that you might want to call family services on her behalf may be the most efficiently built engine of escalating terror you will ever encounter  but spielberg s technique serves no purpose this time except the visceral the destruction is so vivid and quick  and the cgi looks so real that somewhere independence day is whimpering in the corner  almost good enough to make you forget its director is an overrated egomaniac and its star is a self righteous nut  o nce you get over your initial sense of awe at the special effects  you re left with the feeling that you re being hit over the head repeatedly    while his  war s  waging  spielberg will have you by the throat  unsatisfying combination of freeze dried family troubles and enormous  thudding monsters    the flat finale    manages to somehow be syrupy and cheesy at the same time what   what   have they created here  really folks  i m at a loss   answers the question  how does a working class guy handle an alien invasion  destruction of earth  and disrespectful kids  spielberg effortlessly centres on the human drama amid the astounding imagery  so it s a pity the adaptation of hg wells  classic novel becomes so contrived even hostile invasions need a bit more character and plot development an unending heart  pounding  adrenalin pumping  sweaty palms inducing ride   it s what summer movies should be like  a problematic blockbuster with one essential saving grace  it s profoundly frightening in a way that few directors have the talent to capture worlds makes for one of the strangest and bleakest productions ever to market itself as summertime movie entertainment it makes independence day look like the muppet movie a disturbing account of earth being thrown into the fan from a master filmmaker ready to take the darkness of our existence to places we may not be ready to confront war of the worlds takes one of our deepest global fears  the threat of annihilation  and gives us a catharsis when humanity reasserts itself has all the mechanized ingenuity of one of those dazzling tripods  but the bigger they are    it s the gutless ending that renders war of the worlds most insulting war of the worlds does what it was made to do  entertain leave it to steven spielberg to turn the end of the world into a treatise on responsible parenting the greatest alien invasion movie everthe images are fresh and imaginative and yet perfectly believable  mixing the normal with the inconceivable war of the worlds is a big  clunky movie containing some sensational sights but lacking the zest and joyous energy we expect from steven spielberg overlooking a disappointing conclusion  war of the worlds is a marvelous entertainment of imagination  edge of your seat suspense  and surprising thoughtfulness event movies as brilliantly executed as war of the worlds come by very  very rarely indeed  easily one of the finest disaster movies of all time this anti close encounters is a spectacular technical exercise  but in the final analysis it s as loud and soulless a piece of equipment as the aliens  tripod death stars spectacle filmmaking of the highest order drawbacks aside  with war of the worlds  hollywood is calling on spielberg to deliver this summer s blockbuster  and he accomplishes the task  the movie is solid all the way around  and spielberg s touches are everywhere steven spielberg s meticulous  thrilling and chilling war of the worlds is a testimony to tension golly  is it too much to expect more character dimension than this from the director of  schindler s list  war of the worlds is easily the most bone chillingly scary movie spielberg has made  but it also taps into an unsettling kind of fear that never goes for the cheap thrill  the dread spielberg conjures is horribly personal spielberg seems to have resigned himself to the fact that he ll never match the impact of the radio show  but he s making no bones about going after that fx oscar spielberg is the only one who can mess up a spielberg film it s the human struggle that makes this a sci fi masterpiece when the guy who made saving private ryan uses the word  war  in a title  audiences should believe him  war of the worlds is brutal steven spielberg returns to the scary territory of jaws and jurassic park and once again proves himself to be the most gifted movie entertainer of his generation we knew spielberg had action chops  but didn t know he had this in him  this anti e t  is so rigorously realized it makes independence day look like finding neverland tom cruise gives one of his most intense performances  and the visual effects have enough high tech power to make an army of interstellar invaders cringe when it s in full throttle  there s not been and probably won t be a better action movie out there this summer a gritty  intense and supremely accomplished sci fier about some distinctly unbenign alien invaders war of the worlds makes a i  look like it ends well  if jurassic park was jaws with claws  war of the world is e t  gone bad  a big  noisy  scary sci fi with dazzling technology that overwhelms the simplistic story and personaeit s a rare thing    a summer movie that demands to be taken as a serious emotional experience a roller coaster of special effects as ray and his family escape from ever more hair raising dangers in ever more improbable  but oddly fun ways spielberg has not only touched the nerve of the american psyche  he has ripped it out  stomped on it and beat it with a club for a full two hours  this is the doomsday hour   inspires the same jaw dropping awe as jurassic park and close encounters both did with the same mix of fantasy  horror  and the regular guy complete nightmare fertilizerthe flick is undeniably fun and spielberg s dusted off magic still works cruise and fanning give oscar caliber performances  the special effects are mind boggling  this is a thoroughly enjoyable film if you forget the silly hollywood ending  a piece of perfectly realized  pure entertainment if you like heart attacks with your movie nights out  then sign yourself up for the war war of the worlds is  hands down  the best big budget film of the summer  maybe the year  spielberg has crafted a real classic nannannannannanthe situations in this sitcom never get as funny as they should  you  me and dupree is an inconsistent trifle   by turns cute and annoying   and not much more not a single laugh herethe film is a mishmash of half baked jokes  sitcom scenarios and owen wilson attempting to float by on his charm this is one of the worst scripts in the history of major studio motion pictures  inconsistent  undeveloped  predictable  poorly thought out    hopeless on every level owen wilson just does what he does  and allows you to take it or leave it  you  me and dupree  then  suffers a slow start and trades too frequently in broad  garish strokes before rallying with some late atypical turns wilson goes from crashing weddings to crashing newlyweds in a comedy that s as tired as week old wedding cake an oddly likeable film that grows on you if you re willing to stick with it  between us  let s just forget the movie a dire cuckoo in the nest comedy there s the odd giggle  but nowhere near enough to keep things going enjoyable comedy with owen wilson on fine comic form  this is a lot better than its trailer suggests a bit dull  since dillon s constrained playing the straight guy  hudson has little to work with  and douglas looks bored     as stale and formulaic as it gets it s not seamless  but wilson fans can safely roll out the welcome mat despite the clashing comedic styles  a game cast     finds a few nuggets of truth and warmth  and several full tilt belly laughs what about bob this ain t you  me and dupree overstays its welcome but a compilation reel of wilson s scenes would make for fairly funny viewing i laughed  but it was at the expense of my pride wilson riffs hard and has his moments  but can t save a comedy with not enough laughs low iqs plague otherwise funny wilson vehicle    the filmmakers can t get the balance right between comedy and cruelty this  comedy  is so clumsily executed and wheezy it s a wonder anyone had the resolve to finish it remarkably forced  ironic  considering it s a starring vehicle for an actor whose most defining quality is his laid back  unaffected demeanor unfortunately  directors anthony and joe russo sometimes push the jokes too hard  relying on tired physical comedy and easy visual jokes only good when wilson s around       in the end  the hints of misogyny and the suggestions of middle class hollowness just blow away in a puff of cheery goodwill a terribly mediocre film that squanders the talent of its stars on a story that could have been funny and even thoughtful with its smart script and an ultra likeable cast  you me and dupree is funny and wacky with plenty of heart  shifting focus beyond expectations     the best part is the way the relationships between the three central characters change unfortunately for you  me and dupree  it s easier to invest patience in people stumbling to find focus and purpose than films searching for the same things laugh free  derivative  punishingly long  comedy  inflicting pain    both on its characters and on hapless audience members    seems to be the play of the day as far as this cesspool of a movie is concerned i wouldn t want to spend five minutes with these people in a cab  not an hour together for dinner  and sure as hell not two hours together in a movie theater in terms of actual laughs  this is somewhere between a scorching std and a sleepy corporate gig dennis miller show like the main character  the movie is okay at first but eventually wears out its welcome you  me and dupree doesn t risk failure  so it amounts to nothing russo and russo can t decide whether they re making a sentimental farce about male friendship or a raunchy comedy spiced up with porn  the latter wins out  though the audience is the loser it is only because of wilson s charm that this movie manages to entertain as much as it does  which is just barely enough forget those awful previews   you  me and dupree  is a rather sweet little movie focusing on friendship  love  life goals  and being true to oneself you ve seen this kind of situation before  but owen wilson gets the warhorse new life the movie can t even decide who s doing what to whom by the end  molly throws carl out at one point and then he comes back to apologize for walking out  that s because they don t know how to end a movie unless someone is apologizing for something we ve seen this all before  and quite frankly  it s starting to get a bit boring we get a whole season s worth of sitcom in an less than two hours  whether or not this is a good thing is a quandary owen wilson is perilously close to doing a dupree on his own career  by wearing out his welcome you  me and dupree seems to have been made by people who don t know the difference between a light comedy and an inconsequential one in the end  dupree doesn t add up to much except a forum for wilson s unique comic persona  which is more than enough for fans amiable if ragtag this is the worst movie wilson has made since he graduated from being jackie chan s punch line ultimately  the movie is redeemed by a string of well earned laughs and its trio of bright and engaging leads you  me and dupree offers moderate fun in a less than stellar summer season gifted though  the directors  may be in smaller doses  they re a long way from mastering the art of feature length comedy wilson tries far too hard  dillon is miserable as the square butt of dumb gags  and just six years after almost famous  isn t hudson still a tad young to play the solid  judgingly mature mommy wife who talks of  prioritizing responsibilities  wilson deserves better  too  he s too smart to make me believe he d actually think this movie is funny yet another comedy about a man child who won t grow up  you  me and dupree has the faintly stale smell of food left overnight on the counter watching  wilson  mug wildly in another uneven film short on plot  the audience may start to wish he would go away for awhile and stop turning up in such repetitive comedies owen wilson single handedly hauls this amiable  middle of the road comedy out of sheer mediocrity think of the uncompromisingly mediocre comedy you  me and dupree as a referendum on whether audiences are tiring of owen wilson s beatific stoner dude character as rapidly as i am wilson  dillon and hudson are likable stars  and there are moments when their characters make a convincing circle of friends  but the russo brothers don t have the maturity to blend the two prongs of the story they ve written if wilson s trademark grin is looking jaundiced by the finale  he has only himself to blame  with you  me and dupree  he has produced a movie as lazy and immature as its title character if you like watching owen wilson play the same character he s played for most of his hollywood career  and like to be able to predict every comic bit in a movie  you  me and dupree is your cup of tea    or  maybe  your six pack the laughs are low key and although the characters are credible they seem to be missing a few dimensions  but the actors make this movie about an immature guy who moves into his newlywed pal s house a pleasant enough visit dupree sustains its groove for the most part  and in this summer of bloated spectaculars  it feels tight  it may be silly  but it s a pleasant enough diversion without core chemistry  the already flimsy plot is unbelievable  without any sexual tension  the fate of the hudson dillon marriage is irrelevant  without any reason for wilson to cut up and caper  why watch him do it it s fast paced amusing fluff if you wanna   stay loose  stay liquid and laugh a lot you  me and dupree is lazy  obvious  never emotionally real and  most unfortunately  sporadically funny at best  it s a movie you ve seen before and you ve seen done better  owen  it s time to grow up if you ve seen the trailer  you ve seen only half the movie    and all the jokes in you  me and dupree  owen wilson plays a freeloading houseguest who wears out his welcome after one day  the film wears out its welcome considerably sooner than that as benjamin franklin once observed  houseguests    like fish    begin to smell after three days  in  this  case  however  it takes less than two hours  little more than a compendium of sight gags that amount to the odd burst of laughter   you  me and dupree  would be unwatchable if not for its formidable cast every situation is completely contrived and almost wants to prove it to you it stages its jokes externally  such as smashing bikes  spilling on skateboards  and catching on fire    all the better if accompanied by a hot soundtrack hit you  me and dupree mostly sputters when he s firing on all cylinders  wilson plays the trickster catalyst  the knowing knave with charming lassitude  now if only his accidental sage can find a fable worth his goofball wisdom you  me and dupree features three first rate actors in need of a first rate movie you  me and dupree  a houseguest from hell tale  is an amiable comedy  but patched together from the plots of so many other movies  recent and otherwise  as to create a distracting sense of deja vu throughout you  me and dupree has the feel of a film that could have gone in any number of directions  and perhaps at one time went in all of them dupree s presence is annoying and disruptive  but not remotely convincing as a legitimate catalyst for exposing anything insightful  amusing or charming about modern relationships wilson is the most intolerable of all  watching him slack his way through this movie made me feel like lou dobbs  i didn t like dupree  i wanted him deported owen wilson crashes a marriage dupree s actions seem to be those of an extreme closet case  complete with an audrey hepburn fixation and a don t ask don t tell obsession for his best friend a video store leftover  suitable only for viewers who have nothing better to do even with wilson s considerable charms trying to give  dupree  depth  you wouldn t     want to spend two hours with him in a darkened movie theater you probably wouldn t want dupree as a long term houseguest but in small doses his  ness  is kinda fun a braver  more female empowering movie would have molly come to her senses and realize that dupree  hygiene and career problems aside  is twice the catch that carl is this movie is nothing more than a classily cast disaster  a something about mary meets meet the parents train wreck we ve seen too many times before when your straight man gets more laughs than you  it s time to modify your act brings together an exceptionally gifted cast and asks the actors to work wonders with mediocre material  often they succeed  although not often enough to make the film a must see   the story has a strong  been there  done that  feel to it feels like an afterthought  a trial and error effort in the search for the ideal owen wilson solo vehicle the film s three leads deliver competent yet thoroughly uninspired performances  with wilson offering up the latest variation on his laid back  cool guy persona   between you and me  dupree is a dud funny that owen wilson should star in a film about a guy who wears out his welcome    kate hudson looks great in a swimsuit and heels   is that enough to recommend theater viewing  not really can we all finally agree that owen wilson has jumped the shark even if it doesn t make you laugh  the movie executives will  all the way to the bank you  me and dupree is exactly the kind of brainless  witless junk that hollywood knows it can peel off the scrap heap at any time and make a quick trip to the bank on this is cringe inducing humor at its most wooden third wheel s a charm when the person happens to be owen wilson  indulging us yet again with his lovable slacker persona you  me and dupree drains owen wilson s tank of charm down to the fumes you  me and dupree may elicit some chuckles throughout  but the premise tires before the film runs its course i don t mean to imply that this film is any good or that it contains an ounce of genuine insight  but as a template for the big baby genre  it s invaluable sporadically enjoyable but instantly forgettable the tone of you  me and dupree is smarmy in that institutional way that doesn t seem to know what the tongue is doing in the cheek  exactly  but keeps it there just in case the end product feels less funny than formulaic  not to mention profoundly disheartening remember the classic comedy the odd couple  this is sort of the same movie  only it s the odd triple and it isn t funny artistically  you  me and dupree is a mess  technically  it s an abomination  spiritually  it s a void  commercially  it ll probably be a big hit although the movie offers a few chuckles here and there  it fails on almost every level there are several problems with the romantic comedy you  me and dupree  not least that there is no filmmaking to speak of i can t imagine many beside wilson pulling off a line about an audrey hepburn sex fantasy involving butter and having it come off as adoring and respectful  this is nothing more than dumb fun  with the scales strongly tipped towards dumb even die hard owen wilson fans will find this feature length sitcom slow going a limp  uninspired dramedy that can never figure out what it wants to be about you  me and dupree is pleasant  likable and warm  but it forgot to pack the funny dupree feels like the most opportunistic of hollywood  packages     a trio of appealing stars with proven track records in this sort of fare paired with a script that s been cobbled together out of odds and ends of other  better movies a feel good comedy about a slacker buddy who turns out to go way beyond his obligations as a best man  something  anything needs to be done soon to keep wilson s stoner savant persona from becoming as generic a product as dairy case cookie dough oh  sweet  sly celebration of slackerdom    i m so glad we met i don t know how long owen wilson can continue to coast on his dippy charm  but as long as his coasting elevates high concept comedies such as you  me and dupree  it s fine by me owen wilson is either an acquired taste or a comedic force who gathers more momentum and skill as he goes  in any case  he gets funnier and funnier with each film were it not for the a list cast  you  me and dupree is an effort one might expect to move directly to video store shelves  bypassing multiplexes altogether in summer multiplex fare  owen wilson does better than cable guy  but not much given the intellectual level of this film and its lack of humor  it is not surprising that the ending rewards bad behavior  if you re smart  it s an ending you will never see owen wilson manages to make it sporadically pleasant  but not nearly enough to make up for the mediocrity of this overblown sitcom you  me and dupree is a situation comedy that subsists purely on vibe  namely owen wilson s ever boyish vibe of an innocence that has overstayed its welcome long into adulthood the problem is not the stars  the problem is that the basic conceit of the movie was bent out of shape by the bigger issue of  who is the star the joke  of course  is that it s really owen wilson who s in control  he can t play the dazed rogue forever  but for now he s the happy master of that domain it s really dupree  dupree and way too much dupree  owen wilson doesn t just star in the movie  he sucks the oxygen out of the room what makes owen wilson a special exception is that his characters always work to make the world more child like and whimsical  and the films brighten up as a result after several false endings  this overlong comedy finally comes to a close  but for everyone involved  the honeymoon was over before it even began one trio you should avoid making a quartet by taking a seat in the audience not even owen wilson s potent slacker charm can save it from a fatal lack of any sort of momentum  much less energy  leaving it with the sort of stasis that sucks all the fun right out of the proceedingsvacillates wildly between the scattered pearls of comic classics and bone tired comic convention the movie goes from being another mildly depressing lump of unrealized comic potential to being an actively unpleasant experience hudson and dillon are straight arrows for wilson s bespoke character  fails to ignite comedy as the unwanted bum guest  owen wilson plays a variation of the role played by monty woolley in man who came to dinner and nolte in down and out in beverly hills  but unlike them  he s just a disturbing presence and has no profound effect on his guests the most clever aspect of you  me and dupree is its rhyming title   after that  it s one long  steep decline into suffering a middling third wheel comedy elevated a couple of notches by the ineffably weird charms of owen wilson the comedy is obvious and flat while the drama is stale nannannannanevery big comic setpiece plays like an idea for a comic setpiece rather than the finished article although the ingredients are all there  set to rise  something is missing  some crucial element to lift it up sequel to the mediocre ben stiller comedy  meet the parents  is a bawdier but inferior movie that relies on the star power of dustin hoffman and barbara streisand as stiller s florida dwelling jewish hippie parents bernie and roz to fuel its ill timed toia consistently entertaining  sometimes uproariously funny film repeats itself and strains for laughs where the original giddily stumbled through them milk bottles and related metaphors feature prominentlyas breast fetish stand ins  but with a decidely peculiar asymmetrical preference for just the left one has its smattering of laughs  but the new faces bring fewer dividends than the elemental de niro ben stiller showdown of the original full review in greekmeet the fockers is frequently funny  but it turns a bit too cruel in the third act to be as worthy a sequel to its predecessor as it could have beenthis sequel s title indicates the content  smutty  silly and liable to make you smirk despite yourself fans of the first will find some amusement in familiarity  but with such a comically able cast this is a missed opportunity the expected misunderstandings ensue  as you d expect  which would be pretty excruciating if not for the performances of hoffman and streisand  dustin hoffman and barbra streisand  seem to have been waiting their whole careers to do unrestrained comedy  and they step into their roles with unparalleled enthusiasm amazing how altering one vowel from the king of all cuss words can spawn a movie franchise    just as mediocre and gratingly unfunny as its predecessor   catch it on hbo for the sheer delight of everything hoffman and streisand do  it s fun to meet the fockers themselves  but the rest of the movie can stay home mildly amusing   but joke repetition and a greater emphasis on outrageousness and vulgarity release a strong scent of the writers  desperation this sequel  like most  is inferior to the original  but it is hard not to like these characters hoffman  in particular  is a delight   he has an infectious comic energy that seems to light up the rest of the cast very often vulgar and tasteless  and though there are some unexpected bursts of humor and even charm in the proceedings  it s light years away from chekhov although not as disarmingly funny the second time around  inspired casting means that  unlike most in laws  the fockers don t outstay their welcome so exaggerated that it veers wildly and awkwardly into pure  outlandish farceeven stiller  who i ve always appreciated  seems to be going through the motions here gauge your interest by how you liked parents and you won t be disappointed the abundance of talent gathered for meet the fockers is sadly shortchanged by the unimaginative script and directorial laissez faire  hoffman and streisand  make a wonderful team  but it s too bad the material isn t fresher and more worth their time and yours it does what few comedies achieve  literally giving me a laugh a minute  sometimes good  deep belly laughs  a vulgar farce that isn t remotely amusing clearly contrived  yet at times undeniably funny  still  from this cast  you may be expecting more substance and less sophomore  no se trata de una obra de arte ni una competidora a los oscar  pero   a quin le importa eso cuando lo que uno busca es rerse un poco     a  star studded but tediously uneven low brow sequel   meet the fockers is pretty much a flavorless family affair to forgetthe awkward  uncomfortable charms of the previous picture have here been replaced with an aggressive vulgarity that bears not even a passing resemblance to human behavior fockers has the combined subtlety of a libido mad bull elephant and a bad case of flatulence in church  but that s the kind of movie it is  you should get your kicks from the fockers hoffman   is like the one kid in gym class who takes frisbee golf seriously there is not one joke in meet the fockers familiary breeds contempt   unless you think a dog flushed down a toilet is a laugh riot  you re better off leaving these fockers alone if you have absolutely nothing else to do  and you can see it for free  with little hassle  you just might get fockersized  does little to alter the formula of the original  but the two films set a nice example of successful use of the concept of theme and variation    the story fails to take the high road   the foreplay was a little boring  but once they start fockering  it works    it may be absurd and in poor taste  but that doesn t mean it can t still be funny this is silliness that s good for a video replay on a rainy day could they not have come up with anything but lumpish  vulgar humor and dumb  focker  puns a comic clash of stereotypical red state and blue state culture  but with a wish fulfillment hollywood ending in which  fockerization  triumphs   could have been much funnier than it is like virtually every sequel to a hit comedy  it recycles and essentially beats to death everything that got a laugh in the original film a little coarser  a little more desperate and a lot less funny than its predecessor  but dustin hoffman saves the day it s left to barbra streisand and dustin hoffman as greg s parents to warm up the picture  and they light it on fire the fockers is a must have for family viewing  it maintains its humor remarkably well  the gifted cast of superstars playing off one another with surprising ease  and  while the belly laughs of the first are noticeably absent  this one doesn t wear out its welcome quite as quickly as that one did a one joke movie but streisand and hoffman make that one joke enjoyable both movies lack the real discomfort and awkwardness that comes with meeting future in laws this film has a lot more heart and it s just a lot of fun throughout with all these wonderful actors there can be worse holiday fluff than watching a tight knit group of hollywood veterans having fun you d think after an eight year absence from the screen   streisand would  return with more self respect watching meet the fockers is like attending a big  potentially wild and funny party in which the guests pretend to have fun fifteen years ago  a movie with streisand  hoffman and deniro in starring roles would have been considered the casting coup of the ages if it weren t for the talent level involved onscreen  meet the fockers would be about as entertaining as a rerun of dharma and greg why would you want to meet such a blowsy  bawdy  shticky crew in a low comedy sequel to meet the parents  two reasons only  barbra streisand and dustin hoffman it is beavis and butt head rewriting the in laws  only the scripts for beavis were much smarter a resolutely average sequel  several subbasements below the first film in both comic inspiration and energy often uproarious the exceptional cast turned the garden variety script they were given into a movie that should please crowds throughout the holiday season don t even rent the dvd  it ll only encourage them despite a cast enhanced with notable players    dustin hoffman and barbra streisand come on board as the elder fockers    the movie has few new jokes to tell  offering little more than slight modulations of familiar scenarios when a movie s title is based on a crass pun  you shouldn t expect the bar to be too highthe laughs are few and far between  bearing only a sloppy  derivative resemblance to its predecessor a negligible product content to stoop for the easy laughs and the easy money a silly good time delivers fewer laughs than its predecessor the family is bigger  but the laughs aren t meet the fockers takes time to generate comic momentum  but the irresistible energy of hoffman and streisand soon refreshes the leftover story line from parents in the tradition of recent hollywood sequels  this one replays the old gags  gooses up the pace and lowers the level of the humor    way lower more than any recent comedy i can think of  meet the fockers seems likely to split audiences between those who find it deliriously funny and those who grind their teeth at its obviousness for audiences that loved meet the parents  the movie is a welcome chance to revisit funny and familiar characters meet the fockers is not much of a movie    just a lot of comic situations barely held together by the semblance of a plot    but it is genuinely funny in a crass way by the film s finale you ll pity any poor fool who actually is named focker    for following this picture they re certain to see a surge in mockery if you enjoyed meet the parents  you ll have just as much fun in meet the fockers it s a toss up as to who gets the worst end of the deal with meet the fockers  the audience or the film s all star cast irrepressible streisand brings her own potent barrage to this company of self interested men  not to mention the melt away women a quick and dirty cash grab sequel  one that substitutes stunt casting for character work and schtick for writing meet the fockers is as tacky as its title  as crass as a kid learning his first cuss word a sloppy and not funny  enough sequel to meet the parents meet the fockers  a sluggish sequel to the anarchic domestic comedy meet the parents  is one visit too many if you keep your expectations in check  the encounter doesn t disappoint hoffman and streisand give energetic  game performances  but the movie provides them with dispiritingly little material one of those relatively rare comedies that s at once puerile  charming and very funny throughout amusing     but not distinctive thanks to an ensemble cast that includes robert de niro  barbra streisand and dustin hoffman  meet the fockers is much more fun than anticipated there is some fun in watching the veterans mix it up    de niro  who looks like he wants to fade into the scenery  streisand  who tries to eat it    but nothing is well developed here this sequel keeps the laughs coming until the ending meet the fockers is not a movie for the ages  it s a movie for a few good laughs playing up the socio religious rifts of the first film  the sequel reflects the country s current political schisms hoffman and streisand are the best things about meet the fockers  the movie would have been better off spending more time with them instead of focusing again on the uneasy relationship between eager to please greg and his father in law  to be jack given how well stiller and de niro play off each other  you ll wish they had more to work with meet the fockers doesn t have the shabby feel of some faltering movies  but its repetitive gags and toilet humor take much of the luster off the focker byrnes wedding the movie is pleasant enough  but never quite reaches critical mass as a comedy a rascally little play on words is the funniest element of meet the fockers  a sequel with big name stars and  only occasionally  laughs to match culture clashing through the snow  in a one joke open sleigh  meet the fockers goes  laughing all the way       to the bank meet the fockers is stuck somewhere between being absolutely hilarious and one of the worst comedies ever committed to celluloid  hoffman and streisand provide some laughs in this sequel to meet the parents but the screenplay lacks comic zest the picture has two lingering scenes that are so excruciatingly funny they compensate for the material that flounders and you thought your parents were embarrassing my new year s plea to stiller  watch sideways  rinse  repeat the audience laughed more because they wanted to find it funny than because they actually did meet the fockers isn t quite as funny as its predecessor  but it definitely has its moments  the ideas behind meet the fockers are the best part of this zany sequel to meet the parents  but getting fockerised is not as funny as it should be coasts on considerable star power to make us laugh with some consistency but never approaches the level of fearless comic abandon that made the first film so popular meet the fockers is a fine sequel  not surpassing the original  but clearly putting forth more of an effort than most follow ups do into the script department  this isn t just a second helping of gaylord focker humiliation  for once here s a comedy sequel that manages to revisit its world without banally repeating it hoffman and streisand   are a wonderful addition to the comedic mix with their relaxed  laid back lifestyle and penchant for randy sexbarbra streisand has the show stopping moments in this uneven comedy because no good joke in hollywood goes untold again     and again  the mixed couple setup receives another extended workout in this modestly amusing sequel the gap between the first and second installments isn t as gaping as with  for instance  analyze this and analyze that  but the laughs fockers generates are the type you feel embarrassed about almost immediately afterward formulaic but consistently funny so many subplots are piled onto meet the fockers that it s a wonder any of the glittering talents assembled here have room to be funny a weary retread without a fraction of the inventiveness that sparked the original never has so much talent been wasted with so little imagination director jay roach gives the film no visual distinction whatsoever but packs on the jokes with tireless bustle the ensemble s giddy chemistry and the addition of perfectly cast topliners dustin hoffman and barbra streisand should find fockers entertaining huge crowds for the holidays and beyond though it s good to see  stiller  back in his stumbling  bumbling element  it s a bummer to see his element wasted in such stumbling  bumbling gags simply too much unpleasantness afoot streisand and especially hoffman are a hoot from the start the jokes are on a different level than the last one  coarse  aggressive  and poorly timed by director jay roach streisand and hoffman are a hoot  the most entertaining haight ashbury movie refugees since lily tomlin and alan alda similarly tormented stiller in flirting with disaster de niro s brilliantly economical expression of utter revulsion somehow never stops being funny deniro is pretty much the only reason to see meet the fockers    betrays  creative exhaustion stiller   by starring in meet the fockers  one of the year s final releases   pulls into a buzzer beating tie with jude law as the most overexposed actor of the movie year there s room left open  of course  for the eagerly awaited conclusion to the parent focker trilogy  here s hoping that when that blessed day arrives  i ll be good and dead greg focker is ashamed of his loving parents and jack byrnes needs viagra  repetitious and just not that funny on the whole  especially since it s so derivative and out of character next to the originalforced and formulaic sequel     is a tedious disappointment this pic is pretty focking lame if you don t think ben stiller is funny  spanglish is playing at the next theater over  meet the fockers made me laugh so hard my stomach started to ache a frantic  pointless sequel  funny in clumps  but mostly contrived and empty while there is a serious subtext  cast and crew remember that this is essentially a frivolous comedynannannannannannanit s always a bad sign in a thriller when the big reveal is greeted by hoots of derisive laughter as with many modern thrillers the actual plot  once it comes to light  is highly implausible  there are a few too many turns towards the end and the climax errs towards the anti climatic  that being said  it s well put together and entertainingly moody a white knuckle ride into the anxieties and terrors of the new millennium    fasten your seatbelts following a smooth takeoff  this psychological thriller hits some turbulence and crash lands due to a preposterous  almost comical  turn of events foster is a master at portraying a woman in terror who s trying to balance her fears with a survival instinct that drives her to somehow prevail full review in greekwhile i do think that foster and the movies she makes need to lighten up  that isn t quite what i have in mind the bickering back and forth between foster and sarsgaard becomes tiresome  and the erriness dissipates without anything as interesting to replace it a disposable b movie without much excitement or ingenuity it s not a good movie despite its stylishness and performances  but it does have a short window of appeal for reasons entirely independent of its plausibility the movie may not soar  but it flies as plane based suspense thrillers go  flightplan has a smooth take off and cruises along nicely for a while  but it hits a rocky patch of turbulence in the third act and goes into a fatal tailspin  rumor is ms  foster s picky about scripts  it s an interesting notion  but it doesn t quite explain the existence of flightplanthe makers of flightplan have trimmed all the meat off the lady vanishes as if it were fat and served us the bone if you can forgive the story for being what it is  as i could not  you will probably get your money s worth out of this film  when will they ever learn it never really takes off as a fully developed chiller  rather settling for familiar characters and cloudy motivations with two and a half good acts out of three and a charismatic jodie foster holding at the centre  flightplan warrants the fare for paying passengers  flight plan  may not win foster another oscar   but  it manages to remind us of how entirely commanding a screen presence she can be a big disappointment takes off well  but boy is the landing bumpy director schwentke swoops around his giant set with an energetic style that keeps this widescreen film from becoming too claustrophobic foster doesn t make a lot of movies these days   but i m starting to wish she d be a little more selective about what she deigns to appear in    it s far from first class     a script with a social agenda nearly undermines all the film had going for it   we live in an era of soccer moms and mommy journalism  and foster is all aboard with mommy based moviemaking presented with such enthusiastic abandon that it s easy to get caught up in the proceedings  no matter how far fetched foster is the reason to see  flightplan   she lends the film both a consummate strength and vulnerability when the movie was over  i stepped out into the daylight and felt a weird sensation  it was a form of relief  the suspense had gotten to me more deeply than i expected flightplan isn t the most intense thriller to roar down the runway  but provides its own sort of satisfaction  while the hidden agenda that eventually surfaces does strain credibility  foster s ability to reign in the improbable     allows this flight to deliver the requisite thrills flightplan  crash lands after take off the movie plummets into a swamp of ever increasing    and increasingly amusing    preposterosity  remain seated  no problem anticipating the explanation of what s going on proves more interesting than the explanation while the story may not be very plausible  the film is compelling largely because of excellent performances by jodie foster and peter sarsgaard  foster s  such a valuable commodity that i wish she d spend her time making better movies queasy  anxiety driven and forgettable   i d advise grounding it it s in the final act when flightplan goes from passable to pitiful foster does the frantic head of the family under great threat very well  as she so superbly demonstrated in an earlier state of panic the key to the film is foster  who reminds us why she s so missed these days we re starkly reminded that there s nothing quite so fickle as paranoia  and that some people are never more persuasive than when they re out of their minds strange   tim burton s corpse bride  takes off   flightplan  stinks  you d think it would be the other way around on the heels of the recent release of wes craven s crafty and creepy airline thriller red eye  flightplan seems to hit a lot of unnecessary air pockets in comparisonfoster s acting packs a punch but her  flight  is grounded by one too many coincidences can she escape his clutches  find her child and solve the mystery  and do we care foster s go for broke plunge into the material makes the flimsy twists barely tolerable i do think this is a solid thriller for our times jodie  jodie  jodie      what could you have been thinking       a rather nifty psychological drama for the first hour  after which it descends into an ordinary mom battling the evil people alone plot flightplan might not necessary execute the cleverest of landings  but with jodie foster onboard  you know it ll at least have an excellent takeoff  a co pilot remarks that all children should have to wear a cowbell  that s true at least for the people aboard this plane    an exercise in pure entertainment it s a profoundly stupid plot     the amazing feat is that  while the film has you in its grasp  you barely notice  genius flightplan should have remained grounded for repairs the longer the conclusion drags  the more attractive the exit sign looks this is the kind of empty film that usually plays on airline flights what i expect from a thriller is that it keep me guessing while scaring the socks off me    and  flightplan  passes this test with flying colors unfortunately  the best part of  flightplan  is the airplane  which exists only on film jodie foster doesn t impress in this lackluster thriller that is far fetched and uninvolving the vanished child one really misses here is that adorably sparky  wised up kid from bugsy malone and alice doesn t live here any more it might not seem quite so awful  even reprehensible  if it didn t waste a pretty good cast  or if it didn t trot out that ultimate poor taste cliche  a child in peril one of those thrillers that pivots around the question of how daring    or how focus group cautious    we suspect the filmmakers will turn out to be the last fifteen minutes are extremely stupid and almost ruin all that good stuff we ve had before when all is said and done  it builds to a climax so tedious the only mystery is how big a yawn will be generated by the endgame theatrics by the time we reach the interminable third act and its action movie climax  it s clear flightplan never should have gotten off the ground succeeds admirably  both as a sophisticated psychological thriller and as an example of  if not great art  then superb craftsmanship a more than decent thriller jodie foster s fiercely intelligent performance drives this disappointing thriller  whose taut  carefully constructed first half is sadly negated by its implausible and    worst of all    unengaging conclusion not worth the trip just another thriller with too much plot foster s cobalt blue eyes and pale  pointy features have rarely been used to such ambiguous effect  is she the hardest or the most hurt looking woman you ve ever seen it s a tense  concise and elegantly shot film that creates a sense of menace from the very beginning     and in a way that s unusual the makers of an anti anxiety drug mentioned in flightplan will probably rethink their involvement once they see the film although it s certainly watchable and has some striking moments  flightplan is ultimately a middling effort that lacks dramatic pay off the last thing we need right now is another blubbering emoter flightplan  nerve racking as it is  stops well short of its final destination attention please  this in flight movie will be cancelled due to a predictable plot that leaves one about as satisfied a bag of airplane peanuts the contrast between kyle s multiple layers of loss and the flurry of life that goes on without her is briefly compelling flightplan grows more and more ponderous and frustrating as the reasons behind kyle s predicament are revealed to be increasingly outlandish the plot  once you have time to think about it  should so obviously never have been cleared for takeoff here s the plan the writers came up with to handle the obstacles between their story and plausibility  ignore them there s so little reason behind the plot that it s hard to focus on foster s fierce performance if you bring an eye mask and a few sleeping pills  you should get through it ok the care and craft exhibited by director robert schwentkerobert schwentke in flightplan is largely undone by a script that self destructs in the third act of an otherwise well made thriller it s a grabby premise in search of a movie it s high anxiety  too bad the landing is so bumpy flightplan calls to mind that old kris kristofferson song  the pilgrim  about the man who doesn t know if the goin  up was worth the comin  down so  just book a reservation to see this movie already flightplan has holes and blank spots you could steer an airbus through flightplan maintains emotional altitude until it starts hitting the turbulence of unbelievable coincidence the longer this one remains in the air  the less inspired it becomes flightplan     a heart stopping thriller talk about fear of flying    as lean and taut as the muscles on jodie foster s fine  boned face  flightplan is a terrific looking thriller that wastes no time with embellishment or asides ultimately what makes this picture fly is foster  who s playing another character who turns jeopardy into vengeance as a rite of motherhood foster is believable  but casting her is like entering a maserati in the soapbox derby two thirds of this movie is pretty gosh darn good and suspenseful  the third act  on the other hand   meh  not so much directed with a crisp eye and some fluid flourishes  and foster makes the thing perfectly watchable  but one can t help but think flightplan is all premise and no plot i was so annoyed with foster s character that i hoped the air marshal would put a bullet in her brain and thus end the misery for the audience  y ou can almost feel  foster  spinning her artistic wheels as the story spins into the ridiculous   the filmmakers take us on a gripping ride    they just forgot to pack a parachute flightplan is another one of those thrillers with a clever setup that  once all the cards are laid out and the plan is revealed in full  completely collapses good performances and striking looks are meaningless if your story falls apart when the tensions should be ratcheting up to unbearable levelfoster s character in flightplan is incredibly one note  and it really wears on you after a bit cleverly combines old school suspense and modern day paranoia into a tense  compact thriller that s scarier than a long flight on a bankrupt airline this airborne jodie foster thriller pretty much runs on autopilot and lands somewhere between not bad and not great what starts out as a decent thriller soon winds up plummeting to the ground  brought down by its own improbable plot twists and illogical storyline flightplan is two thirds of a great movie and one third of a mediocre one  but hey  even the mediocre one has jodie foster in it flightplan is a good example of foster s uncanny ability to make almost any material work like a delicious oven confection that has us clamoring for its final outcome  once the door is open too soon   it flattens on sight fantastic job setting up a very eerie  frightening and confusing story     but the ending falls short of our greatest hopesso preposterous that you not only have to put your brain on hold but remove it from your skull  toss it to the floor and stomp it into insensibility it s always a bad sign in a thriller when the big reveal is greeted by hoots of derisive laughter panic room made sense  and flightplan does not  none at all  really packed with enough crates of red herring to feed a starving city   one of the lamest psychological thrillers to come along in a whileit s got plenty of talented people working on it  but it seems like they all turned a blind eye to the fact that they were creating something truly terrible plunges almost immediately into the suspense and maintains it throughout  highlighted by terrific performances by foster  sarsgaard  and bean  foster is  terrific in the part  and the movie is great fun despite the participation of selective  talented actress jodie foster and a screenplay that borrows heavily from the lady vanishes  flightplan can t avoid falling apart during its final half hour  flightplan stays on  a course mapped out by so many celluloid disappearing acts that pale in the long shadow of hitchcock s the lady vanishes flightplan establishes a solid enough takeoff  but with such unnecessary distractions  even foster can t save it from crashing outrageous illogical resolution to what is otherwise a fine thriller the movie loses some of its initial atmospheric tension as paranoid thrills give way to rambo high jinks jodie foster might draw audiences on opening weekend  and who knows what the spectacular drama this week at lax may do for an in flight melodrama  but audiences might react adversely to such transparent manipulation for so weak a payoff flightplan is sillier and more outlandish than red eye  and ultimately less effective  but it s still fun and certainly not boring to watch jodie foster storm through a phony airplane for an entire movie has its very minor pleasures  but there is nothing here to feed the head or fray the nerves if the film had met the expectations so well laid down by the advertising campaign  we would have a top notch thriller on our hands every time the film starts to ascend into dramatic territory  it hits an air pocket and loses momentumthe script by billy ray and peter a  dowling contains plot holes the size of an airbus where the flight from hell leads is no great shake  but getting there is exciting enough to be worth the trip flightplan is like airplane food  no matter how good the ingredients the air chef has to work with  the entree inevitably ends up tasting like a xerox of a facsimile of a meal the first half  which is vintage hitchcock  is by far superior to the second half  which is pure steven seagal foster should get frequent crier miles for this role  she shifts her character into panic mode so quickly that we also have no trouble believing she could be losing her marbles flightplan is not a smart movie  but it can be a reasonably fun and entertaining one the movie s concept is cool  the execution is taut and filled with suspense  but the resolution is badly flawed flightplan delivers a frightening thriller with an airtight plot everything from the icy blue palette of the cinematography to the icy blue glare of its star speaks to a mood that is somber rather than hyperkinetic not since william shatner saw a thingie on the wing of his plane in an old twilight zone has a flight been thrown into such panic by one passenger foster plays the mother of all mothers  the movie imparts a fear of flying  all right     but only because it reminds you of the dross you re usually forced to watch up there flightplan is a crackler of a suspense film and a solid entry into the early autumn season a first rate thriller before it crashes and burns in the final act   the solution to the mystery is a real groaner and a politically correct cop out flightplan never attains liftoff since its basic premise is never made credible  even for a minute the third act begins with another twist   but this one is so arduous  absurd and out of character for the film that the entire plot  stretching back to scene one  is sabotagedmarred by implausibility  underdeveloped characters  and bad climax  technically flightplan is great  taking full advantage of its confined space and restricted narrative timenannannannannannannannannannannannani d like to report that the curious case of benjamin button represents the end of an era  one of those turning points when american movies just have to change because they can t get any worse  throughout  the film seems to lack the necessary ingredient to engage the audience with more than its superficial beauty it could have worked  had it ever snapped to life  but it doesn t  it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on  and on  you may even shake your watch to check it is still going  i know i did     i was pleasantly surprised one troubling thing is the pedophile overtone that runs throughout the film converts an f  scott fitzgerald short story about a man aging backward into an overly long exercise in pseudo profundity bearing little resemblance to its source a man who ages backwards will never be able to bond to another person in a truly meaningful way  we can barely be expected to return affection that isn t there everything sure is pretty  but i m not sure this movie has anything to say one of the best half movies of the year david fincher s epic doesn t wallow in nihilistic obsessions  but preached no comforting homily about life s rich pageant either  life is feel good in spurts   a series of oddly interconnected  occasionally elating moments that accumulate before death it s not an inherently flawed premise  but it is in writer roth s saccharine stained hands  it s frustrating  because it s easy to see how it could have been so much better sure  i cried at the end  i m not a robot  but i cry at cat food commercials if they punch the right button  i just can t get on the button train  i wish i could have obeyed my instincts and stayed home brad pitt spends a lifetime aging backward in the curious case of benjamin button  and there are points in the movie where your tired hindquarters feel as if they ve been along for every minute of his strange journey the curious case of benjamin button is the total package  a deftly assembled fairy tale that unspools like a pleasant dream who knew that f  scott fitzgerald s short story would end up on the screen as a three hour botox ad between the visuals and the pitt factor  this is a movie your girlfriend will dig  but there s enough crazy fantasy stuff going on that i d never call it a  chick flick a slow starter  and it never really speeds up into a thrilling film  save for one scene of war on the ocean  however  it s not meant to be fast paced or riveted with action yes  button can be glorious  but the hollywood glamour drowns the soul that it so needs  plus  there is the insistent reminder that we will all lose our looks and die with fine acting all around  and fincher s typically meticulous filmmaking engagingly  if coldly  transportive above and beyond roth s mediocre script  the curious case of benjamin button bears examining   blu ray     a beautiful  heartbreaking film     packed with tender  loving performances and some of the most astounding visual effects we have ever seen an outsized romantic epic built on a potentially flimsy bit of fantastical whimsy that instead becomes an affecting allegory for the fleeting joys of lifethe movie is gentle and sweet  nothing more  nothing less  and told most poetically fincher s fascination with  and film s illusory power over  time deepened the mystery of his previous film  zodiac  such insights also redeem button from its cuteness and kitsch it s a curious story indeed  a long and rambling exploration of time and what we make of it it is the cream of the crop in the categories of cinematography  editing  art direction  sound mixing  costume design  special visual effects  makeup and original musical score an exceptionally well made movie with strong performances  most notably those by cate blanchett and tilda swinton  both at the top of their games on the one hand  it is a masterful piece of craftsmanship  replete with outstanding cinematography  set design and special effects makeup work  on the other hand  it s slow paced and overstuffed  not to mentionthe curious case of benjamin button is an anodyne hollywood film that offers a safe and sanitised view of life and death  it s forrest gump goes backwards this bizarre american odyssey carries a lot of cultural freight  but fails to delivers it to a destination of any significance fincher treats roth s script with a visual bravura and narrative gusto far beyond the usual capacities of the hollywood mainstream  benjamin button is a poetic  virtuoso feat  as eloquent and rapturous as cgi era cinema gets the curious case of benjamin button is not just a technical marvel  it is an epic piece of storytelling with an incredible attention to detail this sensational film is richly deserving of the lavish praise it has won from all corners the film is sporadically entertaining and intends to be profound but has nothing to say about life except we shouldn t waste a single precious moment of it  but i learned that already from jim carrey in yes man  and in nearly half the time remove  curious  from the title and replace it with  twee and pointless   and you re close to it  what a incredible shaggy puppy of a movie  a cobweb construction patched together with cgi  prosthetics  gibberish and warm tears the anti slumdog millionaire  a film that s stately  tasteful and genteelly melancholic rather than fevered  rollicking and euphoric  it s a film about time that seems almost out of time the curious case of benjamin button shows that whether we live life forwards or backwards  the outside is just a shell and it s what we choose to do with life that sifts out the best parts from the worst benjamin button is an absolute masterpiece and is probably one of the greatest films of all time i found it agonisingly banal  twee and self important   a dreadful sell out to hollywood at its schmaltziest by a director i have previously admired whether you are young  old or somewhere in the middle  make sure you find time for this saga saga for a melodrama concerned with emotional pain  this fairy tale favours formal trickery over human connection to a fault an epic  melancholic romance that employs a multi generational cast and groundbreaking visual effects  it s a testament to fincher s skill as a storyteller that the film actually works  albeit sporadically an unusual conceit brilliantly executed  a moving work of golden fantasy poised just above the dark waters of our own mortality it is a tedious marathon of smoke and mirrors  in terms of the basic requirements of three reel drama the film lacks substance  credibility  a decent script and characters you might actually care for if the film falls short of greatness  it s because button remains too enigmatic a rich  rewarding  polished diamond of a film life  death and a love that burns bright and brief as a firefly    only fincher could lighten up and still turn in a film obsessed with transience  with mortality  flecked with flaws  button nonetheless stands as a monument to its maker s talent this is a compelling and wondrous film  yes it is a little slow at times  but this is an epic tale of a miraculous romance   and you can t rush such things it often catches the fitzgerald mood of elegy and might have been  that subtle rapture of remembrance that can make us prize the lost past or future over the gift wrapped immediacies of the present an intended tour de force  it is strangely unable to engage the emotions  in the end it amounts to an overweight movie that delivers less than its clever director  david fincher  seems to think enjoyable  engaging and beautifully made drama with stunning special effects and terrific performances from brad pitt and cate blanchett tccobb is monumentally impressive  three hours of pure screen magic thirteen oscar nominations  you have to wonder at the emotional maturity of the academy awards jury   perhaps they  as pitt s button  are ageing in reverse and are now sitting on their potties filled with fascinating characters  wonderfully portrayed by a gifted cast of actors if only the screenplay had taken its time to fully and organically flesh out its characters and their emotions  the curious case of benjamin button would have been a much more emotionally powerful experience there s a puzzling incuriousity about benjamin s affliction  and gauzy scrims of separation between the audience and this fascinating but oblique  unknowable protagonist click to read full articlecoming out of the theater  not only are you three hours older than you were when you went in  but you get the sense that your too human flesh is also that much closer to obsolete this long and somber journey is nonetheless fascinating to watch thanks to the technology behind brad pitt s aging from old to young and visuals that contain a lasting power it s fitting that a movie in which the last comes first  in which the dessert acts as appetizer  that the best of benjamin begins the proceedings  but  as followed by blander courses  ultimately dissatisfying a very sweet film  a freak of nature story  a love story  a surreal drama  button is at its best reminding us the beauty  miracle  and impermanence of real life as much as i admired benjamin button s gimmicks  the excellent makeup and a sometimes mesmerizing emotional journey  i just couldn t shoo away the obvious forrest gump similarities  roth leans on them too strongly as a screenplay crutch a film with the epic scope of a crowd pleaser but the subtlety of an introspective character study  the curious case of benjamin button is at once intimate and sweeping  and one of the year s very best films a fascinating tall tale until the incredible tilda swinton appears  vulnerable  full of regrets and compelling us to start thinking  but from then on  this is a tour de force holds your interest  but it s ultimately pointless  and the ending lets him off the hook fincher s strange romantic epic has its greatest impact the first time around  overall  the film seems more like a beautiful curio than anything else  a sort of artsy fartsy forest gump i found its state of the art technical aspects more engaging the movie is curiously listless  with all of its passion apparently expended on its technical feats compelling drama takes on big life questions a heartfelt and loving film that is meant to help you remember to not take life for granted and treasure every moment the film unfolds like an epic poem  and like longfellow or yates the imagery catapulting it across decade long stanzas fly by so quickly the whole thing is over almost before you know it the a list cheekbones  cgi wow factor and sensous cinematography can t save it  this is hollywood at full bluster    spectacular and sometimes iconic  but emotionally half baked it s a speculative and enthralling fantasy about what it would be like to age in reverse with a running time of almost three slow going hours  the movie definitely makes you feel as though you re aging forward the film s over two and half hours so go when you are in the mood to just escape into a fairy tale  take a moment to search around the gorgeous sets and remember  a film like this doesn t get made these days  wait  it does and it did before taking into account anything about its story  characters  or performances  the film is an awe inspiring technical achievement the requisite apprehensions about turning a story of only a few pages into a film of feature length are promptly dispatched    or  well  protractedly dispatched this particular viewing experience is not like being on the edge of your seat  or laughing yourself silly  or being scared out of your wits  benjamin button washes over you in an almost hypnotic way  call it cinematic mediation all the intense  pent up passion between benjamin and daisy which kept the film so taut and engrossing for an hour and a half is a mortifying drain once they unite and are free to express their devotion brad pitt is growing as an actor but his lack of chemistry with blanchett robs the movie of its emotional corepitt s benjamin is colorless  gawping  and passive there s leisure to the storytelling  a splendor that captures the movie s celebratory but also melancholy ideas about our time on this mortal coil button has a wide eyed innocence that almost never palls  it strays far from the mind of f  scott fitzgerald  but often enough it came near to my heart david fincher has always seemed to me a talented and clever  sometimes passionate and questing  director  now i think he s a great one  the curious case of benjamin button is a great american movie     a melancholic reminder of the transience of life  and the mutability of this mortal flesh so it s just like this crazy life thing  you know  you re born  you do some stuff  maybe if you re lucky you fall in love    and then you die captures the sadness and exhilaration of life and puts both side by side in a way that is undeniably movingthe curious case of benjamin button leaves you colder than it should  and it shouldn t leave you cold at all while benjamin button demonstrates imagination  it doesn t inspire it fincher s visual mastery and pitt s charisma almost compensate for a gimmick in search of a meaning  the more time fincher gives viewers with button  the thinner the character grows the curious case of benjamin button does what technically masterful films so rarely do  inspiring a tremendous sense of warmth as well as admiration there is much to appreciate in fincher s film  which was clearly a delicate undertaking  ultimately  it is ambitious enough that a misstep or two can be forgiven it has been a while since mainstream hollywood has come up with a big budget  big star vehicle as unique  audacious and rewarding as the curious case of benjamin button the curious case of benjamin button is that rare thing  a truly magical movie the film quickly outgrows any sense of gimmickry and matures into a one of a kind meditation on mortality  time s inexorable passage and the fleeting sweetness of love benjamin button is little more than gump by way of dorian gray  it plays too safe when it should be letting its freak flag fly benjamin button is strong because it connects with the human desire to transcend the inevitable constraints of time the lesson here is never to aim to make a great movie before locking in the framework for a good one forrest gump told us life s like a box of chocolates  benjamin button reminds us of the melted  shriveled and petrified future of those candies   nothing lasts  a new american classic    this is a movie of such emotional poignancy that the excessive length didn t bother me that much a moving look at a life well lived  the curious case of benjamin button  is elegant  well structured  and well acted by the entire cast from pitt  cate blanchett  and taraji p  henson more than just a film  david fincher s the curious case of benjamin button is a genuine accomplishment  it stylistically shows a span of history  carefully orchestrating an evolution of style and mood that tracks the passing years bumper stickers as descartes from a director who  until now  could have been called any number of things  but never patronizing the year s best looking movie button  ends up being an eloquent and moving tale that keeps all its lighter and darker elements in near perfect balance elegant  understated epic takes its time going backward with forward thinking director at the helm a far fetched fairy tale about the freakish birth of an infant who was born as an old man and who ages from birth in reverse the character doesn t change    he  stays the way he was when he was this  simpleton with wisdom   and that s too gump like in pondering the big picture  benjamin button often falls under the spell of its own epic sweep  inviting us to join its makers in marveling at the marvelousness of it all the movie flows gracefully along  unrushed but ever forward  like time itself  and new orleans  lovely old neighborhoods and romantic ambiance form the ideal locale for a gently fantastical tale at nearly three hours  it s too long by a third   and that s where the quibbles end  the film is rich and intelligent  beautifully shot and just as well acted  not the year s best movie  but among them don t believe the pre release hype  this one s only for those of you who simply have to sit through all the best picture nominees it has a lot going for it  but it never quite comes together into a satisfying whole fincher s achievement is  in both quality and spirit  a film of great beauty  and it touched me deeply    has all the features of greatness except the magic the magic of cinema defined  the curious case of benjamin button displays filmmaker david fincher s visionary excellence to maximum effect its failures are spectacularly highlighted by its overwhelming ambition don t expect this movie to make you feel cheerful  it s definitely a downer  i get gloomy just thinking about it few actors have the ability to make you believe they are an old man and a young boy at the same time   brad pitt has a blast with the part   without fincher behind the scenes  this would be an occasionally interesting  often irritating trifle  with him  it s some manner of masterpiece the literal benjamin button that fincher and pitt have created with special effects is bland and passive even in the years when you d think a reverse ager would be most conflicted  fatalistic  or wise benjamin button is a film of mood  not motion  at its best  it is evocative and affecting  at its worst  an exercise in sentimental portraiture rambling story never detracts from the overall wonderfate  mortality  life and death  all of this is explored in a beautifully crafted film without seeping into sentimentality even if this life lived in reverse doesn t make you look at your life differently  the way it s been expertly presented may make you look at the next movie on your list in a new way it s a well crafted  good looking film  and i love the names involved     it s just not exciting enough even if it s a bit mannered and over constructed  there s plenty in here to get us thinkingfincher s selling us beautifully cheekboned movie stars frolicking in bedsheets and calling it a great love  i didn t buy it for a second the curious case of benjamin button sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist s condition a gravely beautiful drama about the mysteries of aging and death given the resources and talent here  quite a movie might have resulted  but it s so hard to care about this story a bit of a downer  but profoundly so a technological marvel and visual triumph groundbreaking  and  visually breathtaking david fincher has done it once again  he has reconfirmed his position as one of the great filmmakers working today and given us a film that is sure to go down as an instant classic because fincher loves things to look amazing  he s got the latest version of whatever digital advance it is that allows you to graft the head of one actor onto the body of another see benjamin button  why not  it s still better than most movies in the world this is the movie that i ve been waiting for david fincher to make since fight club the problem with the curious case of benjamin button is that it aims for profundity and merely hits homespun wisdom in terms of immediate emotional impact  the curious case of benjamin button is extremely satisfying it turns out that skipping a  blowout  garage sale she was planning paid off for up and coming actress taraji p  henson after all  she told hollywoodchicago com in a chicago interview after netting her benjamin button role david fincher was simply not the right man for the job and it shows at every turn in a film that is a complete and utter failure at everything it set out to tackle i am not exaggerating when i say this is one of the best flicks to come out in years  it is perfect in every aspect of filmmaking  i e  acting  directing  pacing  editing  make up  set design  special effects fincher mainly succeeds in making the movie charming  a ride as gentle and whimsical as its protagonist  a technical triumph backing  yes  a curious narrative the curious case of benjamin button is big screen botox for your soul nothing lasts or does it   the curious case of benjamin button  gives us an interesting perspective on the human condition   on aging  loss  and mortality parental content reviewthis is a film with the scope and reach of almost a century but its power comes from the smallest gestures and the simplest moments the film  ambitious if flawed  also is lyrical and melancholy as it tells the story of a man aging backward i liked the curious case of benjamin button  but i wanted to love it the curious case of benjamin button puts a hollywood sheen on a decidedly eccentric yarn director david fincher tells this imaginative story with uncharacteristic warmth  but with his usual sure sense of control and technical skill i m not entirely convinced that fincher has a firm grasp yet on the tender and the sweet  but it s heartening to see him try    let alone succeed as well as he does we get it fincher  some day we re all going to be dead  now what it s like a box of chocolates  but with hollow centers fincher renders the era with a precise eye for atmosphere and physical detail this is a long  impeccably detailed  richly textured movie about a most unusual life  and although it s far from perfect  the sum of it achieves what fincher set out to do in the first place benjamin button falls short of greatness  but no other film this year has been so open to the possibilities of cinematic storytelling contemplative  sumptuous and haunting  this is one of the year s best films director david fincher has turned out an overlong  forrest gumpian exercise in mannered whimsy  it s sentimental  it s episodic  it dawdles  brad pitt spends a good length of screen time drinking tea with tilda swinton  but it s also bewitching damn thing never seems to end a film whose individual parts are more entrancing than the middlebrow whole an extravagantly ambitious movie that s easy to admire but a challenge to love it ll take two and a half hours of your life and still make you feel younger benjamin button may be the most passive titular character in a motion picture until the terri schiavo story gets off the ground a symphony in the language of film  the curious case of benjamin button is simultaneously uplifting  devastating  and achingly human initially intriguing and often dazzling  it ultimately drags on too long  with its wonder succumbing to frustration as the minutes drift by a curiosity  you might say is benjamin button the best film of the year  i m not sure  but it is definitely good enough to be even if the curious case of benjamin button isn t the home run fincher s devoted fan base was hoping for  it is a beautifully crafted movie it takes a world class storyteller and a great yarn to rivet your attention for nearly three hours  this very classy  old school movie    employing cutting edge technology that will make your eyes pop    did it for me that this movie doesn t seem fantastic at all is a testimony to its emotional power it s fincher s picture  and his universe is one of exquisite fakery and frequent  elegant visual delight it s a testament to fincher s craftsmanship that even such a bleak message can evoke feelings of hope and wonder despite its length and expansive pace  it s never dull  and  despite the dubiousness of its stabs at being  meaningful   it still leaves you with more than most mega productions    a romantic  gentle  and magical movie people will tell you this is a deeply romantic film  don t buy it   because you ll be missing out on the true value of the movie an artistic and narrative triumph and one of the most beautiful love stories set to screen in a very long time the curious case of benjamin button isn t about a man who lives backwards or a woman who lives forwards     get past the plot  the pitch  and the technique  and you can see it as a reminder that all we can do is live now it tells a grand  eloquent tale full of romance and melancholy the adapted screenplay by eric roth    uses  his own  forrest gump  as the outline  gives us a central character who is far too passive and fails to apply the wisdom of age to youth in any profound way there may not be the normal  anticipated dosage of sentiment to latch onto in this film  but in exchange for patience and a little faith  button presents the exquisite weight of the human experience in a manner the screen rarely witnesses fitzgerald gumpified   a gorgeously made would be tearjerker that leaves the ducts dry because of its extreme artificiality  in both plot and execution pitt is quite good in the lead even if it does take close to two hours for him to show up in a matinee idol form we ve all come to know  it s an underplayed performance  nicely pitched against great actresses button makes some powerful points about the precious commodities of love  happiness and time not nearly curious enough while i would recommend david fincher s the curious case of benjamin button as worth seeing  i simply cannot work up any great love for it while director fincher has accomplished any number of technical marvels in the film  benjamin button lacks a soul many may see this as a more grown up version of forrest gump  but it feels to me like something from the pen of charlie kaufman  who enjoys playing with time and conventions in much the way fincher and roth do here fincher s film  based on an f  scott fitzgerald short story about a man who ages in reverse  is rambling and gorgeous    perhaps a bit overlong and gooey in the midsection    but one that leaves you with a lingering wistfulness benjamin button is a film about the feat of its own whiz bang  frankensteinian digital imagery  drunk on its own accomplishment to an extent that feels quasi ethical the movie looks amazing  and for the first hour  when storytelling and special effects bond like lovers  it plays even better a terrific film the characters that come in and out of benjamin s life are distinct  memorable  and wonderfully conceived sentimental fantasy that packs a visual punch it works   kind of   but it takes its sweet time in getting there and leaves little behind truly worthy of remembrance the new eighty in hollywood as a one year old  and by the time pitt s lover is clutching her object of erotic desire as he squirms around in her arms in diapers and all of one foot long  let s just say that it s more than a little on the kinky side a relatively morose morality play likely to land its share of accolades during award season provided everyone stops comparing it to gump tantalizing  touching and timeless   an epic fable revolving around mortality benjamin s very blankness gives the film a beguiling measure of dreamy  fabulistic wonder  one that entrances even as roth s script regularly missteps visually arresting but woefully short on substance david fincher s adaptation of f  scott fitzgearld s short story about a man who ages backward is like a parlor game that wears out its welcome the wild and wonderful adventures of an oddball outsider with a terrible physical affliction who makes the most out of his journey in the company of a lovable band of eccentrics and misfits this is a beautifully made film     but     it is also a piece of cinematic artifice  in which the manufacture of it stands between it and us    big on novelty and sentimentality but short on tension and interest for the audiencethis film is about seeing brad pitt grow younger and handsomer until he becomes so young and handsome that it s a marvel equivalent to the launch of an apollo rocket brilliant    beautiful and incredibly moving it s a speculative and enthralling fantasy about what it would be like to age in reverse the curious case of benjamin button is a monumental achievement    not only one of the best films of the year  but one of the greatest films ever made david fincher s wildly overlong adaptation of the f  scott fitzgerald short story misses a key point from its source material  the story should be a short one it s too bad that i can barely remember the movie after only a week  nothing lasts  indeed a life lived in backward progression leaves a feeling of melancholy in this accomplished realization of a novel concept overlong  but any film that can make brad pitt look homely deserves to sweep the special effects awards pitt s trust in david fincher proves that both richly deserve accolades for bringing magic and poignancy without sentimentality to this fantasy tale lyrical  original  misshapen and deeply felt  this is one flawed beauty of a movie the most important word in the title of the curious case of benjamin button is  curious a wildly ambitious fantasy which contains many intriguing elements and superb production values but ultimately fails to cohere as the epic tragedy it wants to be an epic tale that contemplates the wonders of life    of birth and death and  most of all  love a richly satisfying serving of deep dish hollywood storytelling nannannannanalong with a terrible ending  there s also a numerous range of plot inconsistencies that insult the audiences intelligence the biggest problem i had with this film was the set up and premise  it works on paper  but most of the movie is spent with the characters being simply awful battle of the sexes romcom with mature content a modest but bubbly comedy of manners   blu ray    despite reservations about the goofy plot and the cocky characters  the movie proceeds pleasantly enough has just enough substance beneath the surface throw the romantic comedy some much needed freshness  mcconaughey  and hudson make the premise  even in its shakier moments  vibrate with a sense of fun it s hard to believe that this drivel was based on a book    but matthew mcconaughey and kate hudson make it somewhat tolerable at least kate hudson s impressive comic flair almost saves this implausible romantic comedy offers nothing new to the genre  but for those who like light tales of meet cute and happily ever after  it ll probably be as welcome as a tub of double fudge ice cream the film has charm and even some grace   an offhandedly luscious vision that the actors are careful not to muss if only filmmakers out there would take a how to course on making romantic comedies with more than just laughs and star appeal  we might actually be making some progress      a fluffy farce of romance and vulnerability   and not just the female s take  but the male perspective as well the comedy in the film works very well  the romance isn t quite as convincing  but good acting and romantic chemistry prevail   i hate to label this lightweight romp a  chick flick   but when the title actually issues a challenge to the fairer sex  well  the writing is on the wall if you re a bit of a romantic with a penchant for playfulness  here is a fresh and funny  entertaining collision of hearts you gotta love love  especially when it s devious  deceitful  selfish  brutal and manipulative she plays the ninny and the harpy  the baby doll and the ball breaker  it s kate hudson s film all right  but this actress is a cold squeeze  not well photographed either  and has the worst hairdo on the east side     before labeling this as just another chick flick  keep in mind that it s a whole lot more enjoyable than most of the current pre summer blockbuster wannabes that studios are unloading right now the kind of instantly disposable but exceptionally agreeable trifle that s best enjoyed with one s significant other  preferably before or after an intimate dinner for two overly long and overstuffed  there s just not enough here for a recommendation fun  funny  chick lit style chortler pokes fun at relationship stereotypes in a way that  while not exactly clever  is pretty amusing    due in large part to the talented leads  hudson y mcconaughey salvan el resultado final gracias simplemente a su encanto personal  this is a pure bubblegum picture  but it works at that level this is a more adult romantic comedy  with humor that a more adult crowd can identify with  and those painful date moments that everyone can relate to hudson needs a little more time to hone her comedic skills before she can charm us through all the watery spots in the film s hot laughs and cold jokes script in what civilization is this kind of behavior romantic leave before the excruciating finale and you should have an ok time it is fun  but empty fun both lovers are duplicitous creeps    in a perverse way they re made for each other when a chick flick goes wrong    and this one hits a dead end in hell    it s a wipeout the funny stuff at the heart of this film struggles in vain to free itself from a cage made of old romantic comedy cliches this tortured premise to get them together and the things they go through  every minute of it just lies flat on the screen a nice enough diversion when the theaters are filled with weightier oscar contenders the same stuff you ve seen in every other run of the mill  artificially sweetened date flick you ve seen this movie before  here it is again the perfect date movie by any impartial system of judgment  it is at best a mediocre film  but within its genre  it s better than some a cobbled together clone of sex and the city  minus most of the humor and poignance the film is based on a very small book of the same name that s illustrated with stick figures  director donald petrie s film miraculously manages to be even less detailed isn t as bad as it looks resorts to the kinds of cliches that were so yesterday two weeks ago too light on laughs and too heavy on predictable moments though something less than a masterpiece of the genre  this good natured skirmish in the war between men and women benefits from hudson s thoroughly charming performance for once  here s a screen couple that easily adds up virtually everything in the movie is off pitch so much of the picture misfires and or simply doesn t work or make sense that the total package is not as good  enjoyable or entertaining as it should be this is a movie that never aspires to be anything more than dimwitted fun  then falls on its aspirations it s about as close to french farce as romantic comedies get  and the closer the better button cute a modest hawn like romance for a new generation a funny premise in search of a movie a shrill  unfunny litany of single folk stereotypes that insults men and women with equal abandon a formulaic romantic comedy that percolates slightly with caustic wit before devolving into idiocy  it s potty humor trite  contrived  but often entertaining this material requires a great deal more suspension of disbelief than even this hokey genre normally demands has enough laughs and silly subplots to keep you looking  but in the end it s the work done by the two leads that saves the film mcconaughey is an actor of limited range  but this time he has a film that fits firmly into his abilities a sure delight for both guys and gals you not only have to be seriously testosterone  deprived to survive this film without embarrassment  you have to buy a romantic premise so ridiculously contrived that even dr  ruth might suspect someone was pulling her little leg lackluster the movie grows formulaic and clumsy in its last third  but what you feel  sitting in a packed theater  is the spark between hudson and the audience it goes on too long and is trapped by too many cliches the hottest couple to come down the pike recently has been frodo and sam  hudson and mcconaughey rate higher on the spark o meter a shallow  convoluted love story with some cheap laughs wrapped around an infomerciala novel concept   botched with juvenile execution hits all the spots that most successful romantic comedies do  and has some decent laughs mixed in the results are supposed to be funny  but are instead painful i am just about ready to write off movies in which people make bets about whether they will  or will not  fall in love days is a watered down  lightweight version of war of the roses made for people who still think friends is funny want to get rid of that guy who s driving you crazy  drag him to this lame romantic comedy starring kate hudson and matthew mcconaughey clumsy  overlong when his mother whispers in andie s ear   don t you break his heart   the double double cross plot takes a backseat to the really in love plot  they play cards  ride his motorcycle  get splashed in a puddle  have sex in the bathroom  she s so cute  he s sif kate hudson and matthew mcconaughey weren t so darn easy on the eyes  the only thing this  battle of the sexes  film would be losing is its audience the picture is entertaining  and it will probably be a big hit  but it s an opportunity wasted the picture is actually watchable they play an emotional game of chicken   and we all win a brand of entertainment that s dissatisfying intellectually and formulaically kate hudson is irresistably adorable in this frothy comedy about the head on collision between two competing bets and one overpowering attraction the movie would have been so much better if it had jumped into its mean spiritedness with gusto and passion  instead of just splashing around in it halfheartedly despite a few clever insights and twists  it s neither good nor distinctive enough to rise above the level of generic romantic comedy if the movie provides no new insight into the contrasting behavior of men and women or the perils of postmodern urban dating  falling well shy of the not too high standard set by  sex and the city  on both fronts  it does have its tart  fizzy moments a too long title is just the first problem for this too long  misguided  so called romantic comedy mutual deception as a comedic conceit predates shakespeare  and it certainly shows its age in this creaker all in all  it s a mostly harmless movie and if you re female and have a mean streak  you should love it  guys should see it as a warning     it is pretty funny  if exaggerated to cartoonish extremes and contrived beyond belief should just count ourselves lucky that the final reunion on a bridge doesn t involve benjamin on horseback and paul young on the soundtrack if reality s your bag  take a pass  but if you re looking for a harmless diversion to get you in the mood for valentine s day  this could be the ticket there may be some way to make this nonsense amusing  but writers kristen buckley and brian regan haven t even figured out a reasonable setup for getting the two together how to lose a guy smoothly satirizes the superficiality of man hungry women and the soullessness of sex hungry men    this film will charm your socks offnot for one frame does it seem possible that these two cutesy twenty somethings won t see the errors of their wagers in time to take the exit to happily ever after land she s selling low self esteem and an impossible image of femininity and he s selling pieces of rock mined by slave labor and made artificially scarce by evil monopolies  maybe they really are made for each other with its ungainly double deception premise  how to lose a guy feels like it was made out of two connect the dots drawings laid haphazardly on top of one another if you want to lose a guy in one day  drag him to see this movie hudson is so impressive than she could charm the paint off the walls this film sticks like high heels in gravel coming out of the gate  but after the necessary unpleasantness are over the bulk of the film is actually quite entertaining  funny and  well  cute this movie is so intent upon getting cheap laughs and putting the protagonists in uncomfortable situations that it forgets they re supposed to be falling in love this film will likely be enjoyed by anyone who has gone through their own share of  clingy  girlfriends with a number of laughs and enough overall entertainment to recommend to anyone looking for a fun night out with their honey a tasty romantic comedy  featuring the battle of the sexes in its most fanciful light if you re working for the new yorker  the legality of laura elena harring s breasts is not an appropriate pitch for your  annals of law  column this is the kind of movie that was doomed on the page  both by an inherently problematic premise and ill conceived character motivations this boy meets girl movie is a chore to sit through an entertaining trifle to a point   but it doesn t treat the character s or the audience s intelligence with the respect they deserve  by the end  you just don t care anymore nannannannannannannannannannannanif you relish the sight of a healthy male body being systematically demolished  beyond the farthest reach of plausible endurance  the passion of the christ is your movie for millions of people  mel gibson shows them their jesus and their salvation if i believed in life eternal with access to a heavenly multiplex i still wouldn t advise you to see this film  but  as things stand  if thou goest anywhere this week  be it to see an honest piece of graven imagery  not this religiose rubbish     can be read both as a literal illustration of the story of christ s suffering at the hands of the roman    and an anti authoritarian tract that questions the very assumptions of guilt and blame that many take for granted the film shares moving  powerful  epic  beautiful extremely violent  and powerful  for mature teens gibson s passion is all over this film   but his resorting to mawkish  superficial tactics blows the tone off course from time to time with a passionate zeal and the budget to back it  mel gibson has created a religious epic which is equally unique  inspirational  and repellent  the film s lack of discretion robs the viewer of his or own conception of christ s crucifixion  it is an exploitative disservice to  the greatest story ever told   that reduces that illustrious narrative to an extended torture episode it s a shame there isn t a good movie deep down in this excuse for gore and sadism it should have been called the passionator i emerged from the passion of the christ depressed and spiritually bruised more sensational than spiritual  this blood soaked take on the stations of the cross retells the gospels as a horror movie  you can t help asking  where has all the love gone if i were a christian  i d be appalled to have this primitive and pornographic bloodbath presume to speak for me for a filmmaker who wants to create an adaptation of the story of jesus  mel gibson s motives seem ironically impure easily the most controversial film of the year  gibson s fil is a visually bold  relentlessly violent epos that suffers from a shallow  undernourished narrative and no characterizations to speak of by giving us the feeling of experiencing jesus  thoughts  and by making us privy to his prayers  the passion draws us toward christ s full humanity like no film before mr  gibson has plucked at the rawest of nerves yet i cannot blame him  he is expressing himself through the medium of film and using the text of his bible as the basis director gibson tends toward populist impulses without much artistry or invention  he prefers bombardment to poetry  a tormented movie about torment  loopy  over reaching and occasionally suspicious  simultaneously  it is a daring artistic endeavour a negative and spiritually underwhelming experience incredibly intense  unflichingly realistic and powerfully moving   one of the all time great cinematic achievements   god bless mel gibson one of the best films of this middle aged decade sick this most human of tales is sadly lacking humanity father forgive them   jesus whippedmight be mistaken for an instructional video on meat tenderizing techniques for cannibal chefs  mel s a muscular christian without a philosophical bone in his head to put so much time  effort and money into something that s ultimately so lifeless seems like a waste to me i don t know how non believers will react to this  but for me it was an affirmation and strengthening of my faith whatever else it is    however flawed we find it    the passion of the christ is a work of art an ambitious  great  and flawed film      it  reminds us that this man never quit loving us  never quit forgiving his enemies  even as they tore him to shreds  to give gibson credit  with the passion he s passionately striving for art  trying to paint the modern equivalent of a caravaggio canvas on an actor s body  but in a world engulfed by holy war  it s one scary picture mel gibson  the lord love him  and i believe he does  has succeeded in producing the first major motion picture ever that is both spiritually and historically challenging those with a spiritually vibrant personal relationship to the story may find it as affirming as it is oppressive it s like a bloody renaissance painting come to life  but the dvd is a disappointment    the director spends so much time recounting in minute and realistic detail the agony of christ that he neglects the stronger  spiritual message  of love and kindness a powerful  artistic expression of one of the most pivotal moments in the christian religion dead languages and horrific violence aside  this is a film everyone should see  whether they hold any religious beliefs or not more of a bludgeon of evangelism than a work of art as a work of devotion and faith   the passion  is a success  as a piece of filmmaking  it is a failure a work that is as horrifying as it is beautiful  as disturbing as it is gratifying  and as powerful as it is controversial una cinta por instantes hermosa  casi siempre demoledora  pero sin duda alguna  profundamente pasional the passion of the christ is the jesus story that s been begging to get made since charlie heston kicked off his robes and sandals whether you enjoy the film or not  it is undeniably something that will generate good discussion and that makes it worth checking out it s almost impossible not to be moved by jim caviezel s vulnerability as christ  even if the idea that he is no  mere  man is never in doubt hey  i don t believe it literally  but it is a movie  after all    it s a great story  too  certainly as compelling as  dead man walking gibson turns the thing into a bloody shock spectacle  he implicates the viewers like the jews who watched the crucifixion and beatings as entertainment i found the film more numbing than moving  as if the transformation it charted was not from human to divine  but from man to carcass and any power these explicit scenes have is in any case undermined by the absurd tweeness of the final moments it s a head bashing experience  by turns exhausting  exhilarating  and infuriating i wanted to be moved  really  i did  a lot  instead  i left cold  like a ballet where physical movements are used to show pain  heartache  evil and sufferingthe entire event is gut wrenching  but mel gibson makes a movie that gives you the guts without the wrench  his jesus is a whipping post beautiful  violent    and also funny for all the wrong reasons  and boring if you want to get offended by a mel gibson movie  nothing is worse than the portrayal of slavery in the patriot  yeah  everyone is a happy free voluntary worker the passion  is big  physical  violent and unflinching  it s unlike any biblical film ever made and it s impossible to watch it with a trace of passivity when audiences walk out of theaters in stunned silence  i m not sure it is for the same reasons director mel gibson wanted this problem of truth    how it might be defined  known  or told    underlies most all of mel gibson s film pretentious cinematography and gritty realism aside  there s not a whole lot in this torture chamber to be passionate abouta high gloss exploitation picture  obsessed with the death jesus conquered  rather than the life he gave    and gives  gibson s  film  virtually stripped of jesus s incandescent views  is little more that a record of one of the thousands of barbarities committed by the romans in judea if gibson imagined that this extended detailing of sadism would somehow be inspirational  he needs to be taken off his biblical steroids gibson is just like all the other hateful men who ve been successful    he s the right guy at the right weak moment  there s no denying gibson s passion in bringing his vision to the screen  no matter how dodgy his religious beliefs the passion of the christ is something of a masterpiece  terrible to behold  unfit for children  certainly  but very much the work of a director in the throes of his own distinct passion overall this is a remarkably unremarkable film  lacking in subtlety and enshrouded in that depressing sense of catholic guilt which gibson no doubt wrestles with every night passion might be a courageous  visceral  boldly artistic motion picture  but that it doesn t make a very convincing dramatic experience gibson may have given us the most profitable version of this story ever made  but he s also given us the most amateurish  absurd  politically suspect and obsessively violent while this is clearly the most controversial film of the year  but i also happen to think it might also be the its most brilliant as well like my reviews for the  harry potter  series  my review of  the passion of the christ  will come from the perspective of someone who has not read the book this is the true gibson story version of the death of christ  in all is re created gory this is one of the most powerful and emotional films i have ever seen takes one of mankind s key tales of grace and redemption and reduces it to horror the style and mode are a little too heterogeneous to come together right  even though some images have a pared down majesty  and the main line of the film is tough is gibson trying somehow to shock us into believing gibson s artistic intentions and interpretation of the gospels have created a film that is both moving and horrifying if art is to be measured by how it provokes  the passion of the christ may end up being the closest thing to art we see in our lifetime general jesus christ is reborn  awarded the most earned purple heart in history  and summons his christian soldiers to march forth and fight whatever battles he calls us to as a film for true believers  passion is zealously self righteous    in the beginning was the word  and the word was agony the power of spectacle overrides spiritual insight mr  gibson has gone to a lot of sweat and expense to make a movie that doesn t say much of anything new whereas the words say love  love  love  the sounds and images say hate  hate  hate it s not an instructive or illuminating experience   but a visceral and vicious one   i t s mel gibson on a bloody pulpit preaching to the converted the movie s biggest sin lies not in where it chooses to cast blame  but in its bungled attempt at manufacturing what i suppose you d have to call an epiphany of excess  is mel gibson  wacko       you d have to be wacked out of your mind to cultivate the desire to create the most realistic depiction of the crucifixion in the history of cinema  from a technical standpoint  the film is impressive  from a narrative or message bringing standpoint  it left me wanting  and the violence    gibson has basically taken the greatest story ever told and turned it into a snuff film     it s kill bill for the churchgoing crowd in a world that has lost grasp of the real values in life  the passion of the christ is a timely piece that makes you reflect on the true worth of faith and love as a film it is nothing but a long third act with no story and  most importantly  no character development for anyone other than pilate gibson s obsession with the pain and suffering of jesus  sublime and terrible  does not transubstantiate into spirituality  rather  the brutality of his film at first repels  then numbs  and finally titillates if gibson s central wish was for people to discuss jesus  mission accomplished  if you can manage to disregard the hype  you ll witness a wonderfully made film a film about the last hours of christ that is both reverent  but also frighteningly realistic and frequently daringa story of betrayal and vindictiveness leading to a mind numbing gorefest that provokes exhaustion more than it inspires the  tolerance  love and forgiveness  which is one of gibson s stated aims it s too turgid to awe the nonbelievers  too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously this is a powerful film until things get splatter film bloody and christ starts looking like a jackson pollock painting with exposed ribs  the passion seems inspired less by the holy trinity than by gibson s other favorite trio  the three stooges if gibson s use of blood and violence makes his audience squirm in their seats and allows the audience to question his film   then he s done his job as a filmmaker    the passion of the christ  invigorates because gibson s artistic choices have serious theological implications gibson has too much belligerence in him to capture the prince of peace at his and our most glorious moment i expected to leave my viewing of the film feeling battered and bruised  but instead i felt very peaceful  seeing the strength required for forgiveness uplifted me for moviegoers who don t share mel gibson s religious agenda  it s nothing but an unpleasant experience the passion is a beautiful film  but an empty one powerful and heart wrenching  gorgeous to look at  and fascinating to contemplate  all issues of religion aside  those components generally result in a film worth seeing it is a film worth seeing and talking about  for better or worse  it gets some things very right  but the violence threatens to overshadow the message it s tough not to describe without using the word  powerful   for pure cinematic artistry it s a masterpiece showing man s inhumanity to man  or in this case  the son of manthe passion of the christ is painstakingly true to its source material  neither editorializing nor embellishing upon what is taught each week in thousands upon thousands of churches across the globe puts us in a situation where we can t help but feel jesus s pain  if only gibson had taken the time to tell more of us why it mattered watching this is a shocking  grim  harrowing experience  audiences should leave in the spirit of exaltation  instead  they re simply exhausted gibson     seems determined to prove that jesus suffered more than anyone who has ever lived  a tiresomely literal argument at best  an exercise in sadomasochistic bullying at worst a very dour  pedestrian picture poetic filmmaking drawing on  and continuing  a long tradition of religious art to see the passion of the christ is to feel brutalized whatever demons fueled mel gibson s longtime passion to mount this work  no redemption is to be found in the one dimensional result it s a crucifiction despite gibson s efforts to hide caviezel s european heritage behind a prosthetic nose and darkened eyes  jesus comes off looking like all other movie depictions whitewashed no other film in history has even attempted such a concentrated interpretation of these unimaginable events let alone do so with what i call such reverential explicitness an inspiring film  no matter what your faith  unrelentingly anti semitic  excessively grotesque and overly narrow in its scopehow you react to it depends mostly on what you take in with you emerging from the job like endurance test of this film s unrelenting horror  it s impossible not to be moved by its visceral impact    how anyone could call gibson s filmic account anti semitic is mindboggling in its confused narrow mindedness passion affords exactly the moviegoing experience gibson intended  an appreciation of christ s sacrifice via an explicit rendering of his suffering a triumphant masterpiece  is gibson this millennium s saint paul mel gibson s labor of love about the death of jesus is incredibly labored  recasting his crucifixion in crimson  slo mo cliches retains a real sense of power  its message never wavers  always visible beneath the gore as a film    and more importantly  as a document of faith    it is a dismayingly simplistic  obvious  overbearing waste remarkable only for the quantities of blood it spills has such anti semitic possibilities and no upside for anyone but believers in mel s vision that the execution of christ is more important than his life     a powerful presentation a high art snuff film   an unhealthy  inhuman  pornographic  masochistic torture mechanism amid the controversy and accusations of excessive violence that surrounds mel gibson s the passion of the christ lies a good movie as a religious experience  the passion of the christ makes a damn fine movie after all the debate about this film   what gibson has delivered is his own passionate vision a two hour bloodbath this is a movie so singular  so intense  so overwhelming that it simply has to be experienced emotional  violent  extreme and very gory  mel gibson s controversial the passion of the christ is a difficult and grotesque experience for most viewers does one really have to so debase christ s story in order to make it relevant to today s audiences jesus stumbles under the weight of the cross so many times  you begin to swear the editors are recycling the same footage over and over again it will spare you no mercy    up there with the greatest films of the genre   although  the director s approach may be somewhat excessive in terms of violence the overriding virtue   is the film s conviction in its own material i can t bring myself to condemn this film     gibson  made the film he was inspired to make  which included writing  directing  producing  financing and marketing  it  himselfit s not the second coming of christ  but it s a finely crafted piece of work that should not be missed one cannot rely on any critic for this film because a biased opinion lies behind every review religion is always a delicate and personal issue  but great filmmaking is great filmmaking  period the cinematic equivalent of a rorschach inkblot  you will probably see in it whatever you choose to see in it  a film of artistic ambition and devotion gibson makes many of the key scenes work does have its share of very powerful moments  and it boasts some strong performances  whether audience members will be able to concentrate on them amid the ultra realistic and excruciating violence  however  is questionable there are scenes in the passion that will remain forever with those who see it a filmed bloodletting like no other on record  essentially a terribly graphic two hour torture sequence even though it is relentlessly intense  at times even deeply moving  the passion ultimately leaves you numb controversy aside  the passion is ultimately a movie    and a masterful one at that  obviously the work of an extremely talented filmmaker it s just bad storytelling the director claims he had no intention of making an anti semitic film and we tend to believe him  in much the same way we believe larry flynt when he says he s not misogynist will rightfully be considered a landmark achievement not only for the passionate responses it is causing but because gibson was able to give one of the oldest and best known stories in literature such contemporary resonance and power one thing is certain  gibson has delivered a film so visceral  so unwavering in his commitment  that it makes most other jesus movies look pale and tepid one of the things that happens while you watch a man slowly beaten to death is that the fact of his life is reinforced  this happened  gibson is saying in expressing his own blend of masochism and piety  mel gibson may well have created a jesus uniquely apt for our time  bloodied  tormented  alienated and alone gibson has made an extraordinary  focused movie with blinders on  showing mostly one color    blood red    from the full christian spectrum bloody to the point of gruesome  moving without being inspiring working with premier cinematographer caleb deschanel  gibson effectively hurls us into christ s living nightmare  creating a mesmerizing twilight zone that is creepy and utterly unforgettable jesus christ is remote  a superman among men  and his teardrops shake the earth a labor of conviction that comes remarkably close to faith based sadism instead of letting his reverence broaden him  gibson uses his action movie expertise to reduce the crucifixion to something kinetic  literal and merely tragic gibson ultimately seems to be preaching to the choir  rejecting standard storytelling conventions such as introducing his characters  assuming his audience already knows everything he s about to tell us  a biblical snuff film you may not believe in the events that transpire in the passion of the christ  but it s hard to deny the grim potency with which they ve been captured powerful and upsetting what graphic sex is to the use of the body in hardcore porno  graphic violence is to destruction of the body of christ in this passion never dull    no mean feat  given that it spends two hours telling a story whose end is widely known    and features performances that range from coarsely effective to phenomenal may have succeeded in exploiting jesus s death for its most highly pitched emotion and drama  but in the process  for many believers  it may have served only to trivialize and further obscure the story s most central and sacred mysteries as it plays out  the brutality brings about more numbing revulsion than the revelatory empathy that mel gibson intends gibson places his faith in christ s suffering  and is determined to make the moviegoer suffer in jesus  name as well gibson has made a movie for nobody  really  but gibson diminishing returns set in after the first series of beating  but the film is a stunner  a must see whatever your beliefs blood soaked pop theology for a doom laden time  its effect that of a gripping yet reductive paradox  it lifts us downward overall  it s just another movie  and it can be dismissed with the same short critique we so often apply to other movies  the book was better by turning the greatest story ever told into the goriest story ever told  director mel gibson breaks the filmmaking commandment thou shall not overkill in the gospel according to mel gibson  blood doesn t lie  it s the only truth that exists  which means the agony is the ecstacy in the passion of the christ it definitely makes the viewer suffer  but it s debatable if by itself that s a truly enlightening contribution to one s understanding of christ s message  a  stunning film  sometimes remarkably moving   at times sublimely beautiful  often sickeningly brutal  but never banal  nor specifically blameful as a movie  it feels incomplete   yes  it s incredibly intense and powerful  but i wanted to see a little more about the compassionate man and a little less bloodshed lost in a labyrinth of stomach churning pugilism  the spectacle is a hefty cross for audiences to bear as a work of cinema  the passion of the christ possesses a majestic beauty within its horror  one that comes most effectively through a tiny  solitary teardrop bears the same relation to other biblical epics as a charnel house does to your local deli although it s very good at showing jesus  suffering  the movie treats him as a propso obsessively and so graphically bloody minded that it comes perilously close to the pornography of violence a very specific film made for a very specific audience one of the most overpowering experiences i ve ever had in a movie theater  the film is a brutal  blood soaked plea for compassion and forgiveness in the face of monstrosity the passion of the christ is a rare thing indeed  then  a work of art that succeeds as a film  as a message  and  yes  as a labor of love the most compelling message of this unflinching  powerful  and haunting movie is that in jesus  name we are obligated to extend our compassion to victims everywhere this is a good film  well made  well told and it is clearly a personal triumph for mel gibson the passion of the christ is a tremendous film and if you look at it through those eyes you may believe that too  if what you are looking for is an overwrought  hyper violent reenactment of jesus  final hours  that is what you will get here  and no more i kept thinking  when is this going to be over  this is not an easy movie to watch the passion of the christ  while not a perfect film  will touch many emotions in those who see it  some people may be offended  while others may be inspired  irrespective of your religious beliefs  mel gibson s brutal depiction of the most renowned story of sacrifice and love is distressing to the very core the passion of the christ plays like a blend of a political theology lesson and a snuff film the bottom line is that the passion of the christ is an astonishing cinematic achievement  utterly riveting from start to finish despite controversies swirling around the movie  one cannot deny that gibson has made a stunning film  beautifully photographed in contrasting dark and golden hues by caleb deschanel watching it is an act of self flagellation this is a two hour and  six minute snuff movie    the jesus chainsaw massacre    that thinks it s an act of faith strangely remote and uninvolving on both emotional and spiritual levels a gripping  powerful motion picture    arguably the most forceful depiction of jesus  death ever to be committed to film regardless of how you feel about the movie s message  you re certain to leave the movie feeling something about the movie itself a dramatically powerful statement controversy over whether it will inflame anti semitism guarantees huge audiences  and many people may be profoundly moved  but as a film it is quite bad controversy aside  it is dramatically intense  skillfully constructed and often harrowing  in ways that should have an impact on people of any or no particular faith the passion of the christ is at once a well crafted film  a merciless excursion into motion picture ultraviolence  and a regrettably cramped historical account that stays doggedly on the surface of its overwhelmingly important subject it leaves one with the impression of a human race so violent it justifies all the fears critics have expressed about potential modern day reactions to the film the passion of the christ is so relentlessly focused on the savagery of jesus  final hours that this film seems to arise less from love than from wrath  and to succeed more in assaulting the spirit than in uplifting it the ultimate contradiction     is that a film about the prince of peace is violent enough to earn an r rating less reverential than razzle dazzlin   more an episode in the history of show business than a religious epiphany    captivating and provocative in its exquisite spirit  the passion of the christ is an ambitious and visceral undertaking that demands acceptance shockingly violent  chock full of scenes drenched in blood  this movie earns its r rating many times over preaching to the choir and doing so in shorthand as a true reading of the gospels    the director s much vaunted aim    the film falls abruptly short the passion doesn t suffer from the airless  pious airs that drag down most biblical dramas  it has a muscular  pounding energy and lyrical  almost gothic beauty if you come seeking theological subtlety  let alone such modern inventions as psychological depth  you ll walk away battered and empty handed intense it s as if gibson is measuring god s love by the amount of blood he shows on the screen if jesus actually received the amount of punishment dished out in this film  he would have been dead three times over before arriving at calvary  impressive filmmaking    but it takes a lot of wincing to watch mel gibson s version of this powerful story saturated with vengeance  betrayal  and melodrama  mel gibson s sadistic take on jesus  final twelve hours screams bloody murder mel gibson s personal vision of the persecution and death of christ is relentless  brutal    and brilliant i was moved by the depth of feeling  by the skill of the actors and technicians  by their desire to see this project through no matter what an unquestionable work of conviction that should outlast the controversy and trigger constructive dialogue for years to come mel gibson s passion  though well acted  technically impressive and initially moving  is for the most part not beautiful and certainly not ennobling an impressive  ultra violent    and deeply troubling    take on jesus  final hours a film so narrowly focused as to be inaccessible for all but the devout in the end  one can respect gibson s high intentions and dedicated work  while remaining spiritually and dramatically unmoved by the result serves as a powerful condemnation of any organized religion that aspires to governance or allow clerics to preach contempt and whip sheepish followers into a frenzy mel gibson shows once again that he s skilled at depicting violence  but you d be hard pressed to find evidence of  tolerance  love and forgiveness  that the producer director co writer insists he s trying to communicate the basic message of christianity    love your brother    is obscured under torrents of blood to the point of benumbing the audience gravely intense and the work of a man as deeply committed to his subject as one could hope for or  for that matter  want  gibson  has made a serious  handsome  excruciating film that radiates total commitment the movie gibson has made from his personal obsessions is a sickening death trip  a grimly unilluminating procession of treachery  beatings  blood  and agony the passion of the christ is powerfully moving and fanatically obtuse in equal doses using ancient languages  vivid images and visceral violence  gibson has brought new life to one of civilization s oldest narratives this graphic depiction of the crucifixion of christ misses any spiritual meaning to this seismic event instead of being moved by christ s suffering  or awed by his sacrifice  i felt abused by a filmmaker intent on punishing an audience  for who knows what sins this is the most powerful  important and by far the most graphic interpretation of christ s final hours ever put on film an all consuming force  it never lets up it is difficult to know who would want to see a film this violent there s no doubt that jim caviezel was put through the wringer here  and he gives a spiritual performance that s offset by the physical ordeal he had to endure during the torture scenes and the crucifixion nannannannanbased on a true story  unlike inglourious basterds valkyrie is another entry into cruise s canon of quality films and performances valkyrie isn t a classic war movie by any means  but is it the total laughing stock many feared  nein valkyrie  as field commanded by director bryan singer  succeeds on its own terms as a handsome hybrid of conspiracy thriller and history lesson  of mission  impossible and the day of the jackal if there s one thing cruise knows how to portray  it s robotic single mindedness counterbalancing the energy vacuum that is cruise is the good news that this is also a bryan singer movie cruise  singer  lose the credibility battle the action is traded for suspense in the movie  which is when things really clicksinger can only touch on the surface of each development  it would help if we could see the failure reflected in von stauffenberg s one good eye  but cruise  alas  can offer little help  he s just tom cruise in an eyepatch maintaining tension in the face of a foregone conclusion is no mean trick  but mr  singer and company do as well as anyone could hope it s never a pretty sight when a limited performer tries to  stretch  by way of cosmetics cruise  looks about as german as jackie chan would in a lederhosen it s the perfect film for our age of reassessment and ambiguity earnest and understated movie about the general s plot against hitler  despite cruise s reputation for derring do characters  this is a very human german colonel that he plays    finally can t help but come off as something of a minor disappointment   the movie proceeds to show how everything  little by little  falls out of place    not the most thrilling of events to cover  but interesting all the same an interminable costume drama strictly for tom cruise fans and for world war ii buffs the movie looks good and seems to hit all the right notes  yet never quite connects or resonates like it should a thrilling political war movie that sees tom cruise and a stellar british cast of high ranking german officers plot to assassinate hitler and end the war before the germany they love is destroyed a well wrought thriller about one group s attempts to assassinate adolf hitler the tension that builds throughout valkyrie is palpable and the plot is incredibly compelling a historically respectful  morally careful film with a more intelligent and taut screenplay  valkyrie could have been much more riveting rather than merely be sporadically thrilling  mostly bland and  ultimately  underwhelming when he is at the top of his game  as he is here  cruise s charisma is blinding the subject demands to be made as a documentary or in a form more imaginative than a linear narrative valkyrie isn t a great war movie  but within its own limited ambitions  it is enjoyable and never dull although the casting of cruise takes some getting used to  the film makes ample use of a strong supporting cast and a tightly knit story to maintain suspense a film more concerned with  how  than  why  or  who   valkyrie would have benefited from more scrutiny and complexity  still  once the bomb goes off  the thrills come in spades as old fashioned historical escapism goes  this is solid  compelling stuff valkyrie s technique is admirable but it misses the mark emotionally singer makes a noble and romantic fist of this terrific story but it feels spookily like a well oiled hollywood entertainment rather than a sensational chapter of history director bryan singer has put together a fairly workable  old fashioned second world war movie this is no the day of the jackal  it s functional  respectful rather than inspired  it won t damage cruise s reputation  but it won t enhance it in any degree either valkyrie may not be awards bait but it is a solid  at times gripping  thriller that wrings every ounce of drama out of what is  at heart  a pulsating tale of the courage and idealism of some undone by the cowardice and politics of others expect thrills  not a revolution valkyrie is no action extravaganza  yet despite having a rich seam of moral ambiguity to mine  the characterisation is no deeper than in singer s x men there s a whiff of pointlessness hanging over this whole affair  the fact that valkyrie is not the thriller the trailer promises is treason against the talent valkyrie it s a good film with more than enough there to keep your attention and for you to have come away feeling satisfied and informed i was never bored  and the period detail is lovingly observed  but there is a sense of an opportunity missed it is no classic but it is stylish  absorbing and wonderfully put together the film survives some dodgy dialogue because of a strong supporting cast valkyrie seems more like history by nintendo  a slickly devised exercise in action drama whose entire research and development budget went into the external details of the plot  leaving none for the inner realism of its participants singer marshals his camera and soundtrack well as his tense  behind the scenes chess game plays out   it feels no more authentic than stauffenberg s glass eyeball in the end  despite him playing someone with a missing eye  it s a vanity project for cruise   a heavyweight historical drama to put him back on the map  but one that only sees him more lost everyone does a jolly good job  including x men director bryan singer  as the conspiracy plot offers adequate tension and bores sturdily onwards the end result  however  is a skewed picture that manages to promote hollywood style derring do and make fascism look more stylish and profound than it has done in years another astonishing true story gets the hollywood treatment and ends up being rather flattened in the processa slick  starry thriller that entertains for the full two hour running time without threatening to do much more than that cruise is  well  cruise with an eye patch  like the film  he isn t great but not bad either it does feel more like a throwback to a time when studio films weren t ruthlessly divvied up as prestige pictures or blockbusters x men fans may disagree  but this is singer s best work since the usual suspects it s a testament to christopher mcquarrie s cogent  keenly observed script and singer s tightly controlled direction that the film remains so utterly compelling a well paced thriller that sheds light on a little known piece of world war ii history kevin irwin   cruise is stomachable and the production is grandly ambitious  but it s the gripping true story that triumphs as the real star it highlights a little known historical event and gives the german resistance the respect it deserves valkyrie  is an anachronistic movie that wants to be less than it should be handsomely mounted but undistinguished   on all counts  this is an extraordinary story and the film  although it begins too earnestly and filled with its own importance  develops into a mostly riveting one  especially in its final hour claus s elevenultimately it is redeemed by its palpably clammy sense of foreboding  plus its offering of a valuable history lesson tom cruise s ego driven  look at me  aren t i heroic   performance detracts  but it s just too compelling and the other performances too pitch perfect for this to ruin things much of valkyrie works  but not quite enough put away the knives aimed at cruise and just enjoy the solid work he keeps putting out as the film eschews self importance  it engages more directly and universally  if only in a rudimentary fashion that fails in terms of overall staying power surely there is some middle ground between a history lesson and mindless action adventure  the people who made valkyrie not only didn t find that ground  they weren t even looking for it this is chew your fingernails country  anyone who misses it simply because it stars a couch jumping scientologist is missing a great film singer and his collaborators have decided to present what ought to be an exciting story with frankly comic solemnity there is an urgent you are there magnetism  each fateful mistake and misstep foreshadowing the group s ultimate demise only adding to the slowly building excitement the top priority of bryan singer s film is not to be a history lesson or character study but to simply be an absorbing adult suspense film valkyrie works as a full dress military drama  fleshing out a historical footnote in vivid detail overall  i really liked this film  and i hope that people check it out in the admittedly crowded holiday season an awkward mix of plodding history and general adequacy  with occasional flourishes of visual panache that seem to be from some other  more stylish movie knowing the ending robs the film of some of the suspense  but cruise and company have made a better movie than expectedtalk about an impossible mission  tom cruise plays a german wwii colonel with plans to assassinate hitler in this distractingly anachronistic fact based tale from bryan singer it is a well made film that raises timeless questions about the demands of military duty when they are placed in conflict with higher principles sure  it s complicated to set up the assassination of a lunatic dictator  but does it have to be so boring the actors don t interact so much as issue pronouncements  and there s not a hint of levity to distract from the gravity of the situation what the film really has going for it is a good supporting cast  actors playing von stauffenberg s fellow conspirators include bill nighy  kenneth branagh and terence stamp what if this lesser known chapter of german resistance had been more deeply captured  what if the moral conflicts running through this movie about love of country and revolt said more about germany  war and  yes  genocide singer keeps the conspiracy racing to its fated conclusion as a suspense movie  this works pretty well it s slickly executed  handsomely acted for the most part and utterly easy to forget following hitchcock s  bomb under the desk  dictum to the bitter end just doesn t work out to anyone s satisfaction here gets off to a slow start  but it s almost like valkyrie had a red bull mid way through as everything is kicked up a notchwill likely not go down as one of cruise s most rewarding moneymakers  though it may become one of his more memorable contributions to the archives valkyrie has all the dramatic oomph of a history channel re enactment valkyrie is made with impeccable professionalism and  flying in the face of years of internet hysteria  is a perfectly acceptable motion picture  the only thing that keeps it from even greater accomplishments may be inherent in the story itself the screenplay by christopher mcquarrie and nathan alexander introduces a seemingly endless series of characters  but there s no time to flesh any of them out enough to make you worry about their fate the stilted and diffuse result is as dramatically compelling as a planning commission meeting valkyrie doesn t whip you up like that jewish vigilante avenger picture defiance  but in this season of throat grabbing holocaust movies  its gentlemanliness is most welcome valkyrie transforms world war ii into a boy s adventure there are some powerful moments and  it s  an interesting true story everybody is i think is good in the film  except tom cruise the problem is not that we know the outcome  the problem is the buildup despite its potential to be a turkey for the ages  singer s blandly proficient historical thriller is fatally forgettable valkyrie is a highly intelligent and deeply engrossing historical drama and  frame for frame  the year s most suspenseful nail biter you just can t quite enter the world of this film  not in the way that you might have if a more nuanced and less iconic actor had played the central role mr  cruise s performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible  though unexceptional  while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural  impressively staged in historical locations valkyrie is a brutally efficient bit of storytelling  and it makes no unforced errors think of valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time tom cruise tried to kill hitler  do that  and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie a taut  suspenseful wwii thriller  bryan singer s exhaustive research pays off by lending this film a stylistic  period  feel meticulous reconstruction of a real life plot to assassinate adolf hitler in the last months of world war ii  minus tension or pacing what you miss in both defiance and valkyrie is inner conflict  their protagonists have not an instant of self doubt  they re figures in historical pageants  not characters in a drama tom cruise delivers stripped of the over the top special effects that have driven cruise s most successful vehicles valkyrie doesn t offer much in its place gets off to a slow start  but once it gets going  it s one of the more fascinating thrillers in recent memory  even though everyone who paid attention in history class will know exactly how it turns out a bit shallow but undeniably thrilling sometimes  conspiracies are more than just theories actually quite good  this is a nice tense political thriller that sticks fairly closely to history the films in this vein that work are the ones who can make you care  even though you know the struggle is futile the film like the conceived plot to kill hitler is commendable for its premise  but is also not well executed the performances truly stand out  led by tom cruise and several members of the supporting cast cruise  who already delivered a great performance this summer in  tropic thunder   is at the top of his game heredirector bryan singer approaches this sensitive material as a strict procedural  it s almost as if we are joining part two of a miniseries already in progress other than an unconvincing tom cruise  this is interesting and well done  especially if you are among the apparent multitudes who don t know anything about this event it ll probably be wicked suspenseful for anybody who didn t pay attention in history class decent enough action thriller even with poor tom s baggage to singer s credit  the film is remarkably suspenseful  even though we know pretty much how it will end it s ironic that a film about an attempt that had some pretty serious flaws feels like its creators made a few mistakes of their own don t believe the negative hype  valkyrie is a stupendous film  and represents two of the most exciting hours i spent in a theater this year bryan singer makes this movie possible  filled with great suspense and amazing actors  this film is on my short list as one of the year s best valkyrie s brawny and big and bold  but it s also stronger  slicker and smarter than you d think valkyrie s suspense isn t of the rousing  creep to the edge of your seat variety  the film is cold  metallic  the tension it creates is more akin to dread valkyrie  is nowhere near the outright bomb that many assumed that it would be  that said  it should be noted that the film is also nowhere near the gripping cinematic experience that it should have been given the subject matter the movie is shallow and clinical  it rarely lets us inside its protagonists  we know that they despise hitler  period  and that they consider themselves patriots     thanks mostly to fine work by its great cast  valkyrie is not a loss and has some riveting moments  but it s not the scintillating wartime thriller it could have been achieves the authenticity of something that the history channel would be proud of a riveting military drama  a popcorn thriller masquerading as a political potboilevalkyrie offers something to filmgoers weary of excessive pretense  but not quite desperate enough to watch jim carrey flop around on the ground thriller and action elements are low scale and unsuccessful  valkyrie is little more than a sketchy and narrow history lesson with less impact than it should have the film is a minor christmas miracle  it succeeds on its own terms  despite the gossip hounds  best blood sniffing efforts  and dares to be an entertainment rather than a statement valkyrie is a world war ii thriller without enough thrills like the coup whose story it tells  valkyrie is a near miss  failing to sweep us along for what should have been a dramatic ride cruise s character  claus von stauffenberg  is off putting and not just because he s a german with a pronounced american accent for a thriller with a thoroughly foreordained outcome  valkyrie does a pretty good job at making the viewer s palms sweat bryan singer has capably crafted this war thriller in such a way that one occasionally forgets the foregone conclusion and becomes wrapped up in the excitement of the moment on one hand  it s kind of silly  on the other  these are very fine actors  and give this super slick thriller some of the facets and angles that help make a cool object at which to gaze singer has a masterful touch with composition  creating tension simply by the way he places his actors around a room  and even though we know how it turned out  the assassination plot remains a gripping tale that last part makes for quite a good  crackling suspense thriller  meticulously researched in all details by the perfectionist singer it may be the same old partners but it s a better dance    here  at least  history leads and hollywood follows it s a crafty action flick with a pristine cast that works  ever so briefly  as a wish fulfillment fantasy with just the slightest tilt toward black comedy  valkyrie could have been the dilbert of nazi movies    like cruise s performance  an overall restraint keeps the heroic story behind  valkyrie  from soaring as high as it should director bryan singer keeps the pace fast  and although we know the ultimate outcome  it s easy to get caught up in the excitement of what if thinking if you don t mind the fluctuation in focus  if the tripwire midsection can get your through the labored last act  valkyrie will be a solid success singer does a superb job at creating suspense in a story where everyone in the audience already knows the outcome it rarely rises to the level of entertainment you expect from a wartime thriller    there s something rote and foregone about the whole affair valkyrie feels like another installment in the never ending franchise    not just the action movie one  but the tom cruise one  like the operation itself  it s a good idea    just not well executed a thoroughly respectable historical re enactment  though lacking the epic scope and dramatic urgency that would make it a truly memorable one when it hooks into the filmgoer  the mix of classic thriller tones and singer s invigorating compositional rhythms brings valkyrie to an impressive boil valkyrie is like having to watch someone build a bomb and then never getting to see it explode based on a true story  valkyrie aims to be a thriller  not an issues movie  and it succeeds what s next  clint eastwood as gandhi valkyrie is a taut suspense flick for grown ups that asks  what if ruthless german efficiency had been used against hitler a meticulous thriller based on a large scale conspiracy within the german army to assassinate hitler in cruise s hands  von stauffenberg comes off as a very human window into this history and this engrossing and involving movie tom cruise  known to some for fun scenes as in the movie  cocktail   is surprisingly effective in the role of the head of a conspiracy to assassinate hitler tom cruise starring in the fact based story of a plot to kill hitler by nazi col  claus von stauffenberg sounds like oscar bait  it isn t  and the sooner you accept it  the more fun you ll have at this satisfying b movie  cruise is  distractingly bad in this  the iconography of his celebrity so strongly overshadowing his performance  he s just too powerfully contemporary valkyrie is every bit as good as you remember a tom cruise movie being  back when you still liked tom cruise i love how singer plays the whole damn thing like the greatest suspense comic book story ever told   a tension packed thriller with a superb cast incongruous vocal intonations aren t even the most significant problem plaguing bryan singer s film the movie is streamlined to a fault  a sleek and purring machine interested in process  not people  so when the plan begins falling apart  audience sympathy is fatally missing valkyrie feels like the exciting second part of a miniseries  part one had all the character bits and drama  though refreshing in its lack of pomp and circumstance  a movie that exists to be a movie and nothing bigger part suspense thriller about the failed assassination of hiter  part social protest drama  part star vehicle to reenergize tom cruise s troubled career  valkyrie is engaging but not a good thriller the film compensates for a lack of verve and action with solid production design and crisp performances from its cast it s just too bad that a film purporting to espouse female empowerment has to resort to simulated fellatio  public urination  and full frontal male nudity in order to get its biggest laughs the sparkling and heartfelt performances from the four leads  plus the sheer boisterousness of the script  makes this a proper laugh out loud watch  girls trip is raunchy comedy performed to perfection  watch this movie if you haven t  it s a goddamned national treasure girls trip never feels like it is judging its characters  even at their most outlandish  instead it repeatedly sends a message that being yourself and living your truth are the way to find happiness  well  the latest free wheeling feminine induced frenzy is presented in the form of filmmaker malcolm d  lee s infectiously bouncy and boisterous  soulful sisterhood romp girls trip despite a generic title and a somewhat formulaic plot   girls trip  emerges as the best raunchy comedy since  bridesmaids this is a film in which the cast has so much fun that the audience can t help but have fun as well movies such as girls trip challenge the confines of the ways women are allowed to be funny especially black women the film is caught in this weird headspace of succeeding at its basest level despite missing the opportunity to excel at its loftiest instead it s one of those things that probably would have flown under the radar had it not been for haddish a refreshingly hilarious raunchy comedy that proves that raunchy comedies can be fun  while predictable  the film makes up for it in all the right ways   this comedy rivals any of its  bromance  predecessors y all  this movie is one wild ride that must be taken  everybody needs to see it  unless you can only enjoy a movie in a completely silent theater    then you may want to try to catch an empty screening girls trip surprised me  it was funny  heartfelt  and had a couple of good messages in it  tiffany  haddish is a genius technician of physical comedy  at once subtle and gigantic  the mvp of girls trip  however  is tiffany haddish  this should be a huge break out role for her  and she is so insanely funny that she ll send you into a rabbit hole of youtube videos from her stand up routines after the movie the film is remarkable for its willingness and ability to flaunt its generic premise and go to far stranger  more empowering places than its simple setup might suggest  it s a beautiful tribute to black womanhood  friendship  and joy in a hilarious package  by far the best comedy of the summer  if not the year  it strikes comedy gold  it s that ridiculously good it s served well by a likable cast it will be way too much for some  but does have a heart  ends on a nice note and you certainly won t forget the totally un embarrassable haddish in a hurry expect plenty of raunchy moments and outrageous drunken situations  the story is a no brainer too girls trip is as pure as old school or bridesmaids  and like both  boasts a breakout star  haddish steals every scene it s another bridesmaids inspired stumble through the tropes of bad girl comedy  which includes the mandatory set piece involving the expulsion of bodily waste   and plenty of blue talk  which is now a regular  if not defining  feature of female comedy  it s able to balance genuine insight with comic punctuation and shameless resolution  they get high and heartfelt malcolm d  lee s exuberant girls trip easily outclasses the likes of bad moms and rough night girls trip s overriding focus is that of friendship    in its all its raw  bawdy  compromised glory as silly  crude and debauched as the antics get  the warmth and joy surrounding the four protagonists continually sets the movie apart from its predecessors if you missed the girls gone bad comedy of rough night earlier this year  don t worry  go and see girls trip instead girls trip is better plotted than the similarly themed  scarlett johansson vehicle rough night from earlier this year  it has a looseness to its structure that helps the momentum move from one crazy set piece to the next however  for all of its ferocious sexual frankness and ear burningly colourful language  girls trip not only knows how to land a big laugh  but also how to sustain and magnify it bridesmaids for black people  girls trip is high energy raucous fun in praise of girl power  complete with brash  crude dialogue and sexual connotationsraunchy comedies aren t everyone s favorite  but for those who like them  girls trip will do quite nicely  it may even turn out to be one of summer s few real surprises the film lives or dies based on the chemistry between the actors  which is just off the charts girls trip is the perfect example of star charisma elevating the material they re working with these four hilarious ladies prove that  when done right  low brow humor can be an art in itself   full review in spanish girls trip proves that a good laugh can cure anything  including the common case of a familiar script   full review in spanish the journey is surprisingly fun  owing to cut above efforts by the principals and a story that  for all its absurdity  essentially spins on traditional themes of sisterhood  kindness and love we ve got a lot of road to travel before we ll know if the quest was worth it  but i m willing to go along on the journey  so that s something what could have been a breezy  thrilling stand alone film is instead a long  sometimes tedious  excursion an adequate filmmaking exercise that strikes most of the same beats as lord of the rings without any of the importance  epic scope or je ne sais quoi freeman has been well cast as the young bilbo  providing a sense of british indignity accompanied by his slightly gormless  gob smacked facial expressions it also has one thing that lord of the rings never did  a story that is human scale  even if it s about hobbits and dwarves at the centre are terrific performances from freeman and richard armitage as the dwarf thorin  plus all the lush scenery  majesty and magic we ve come to expect from jackson   strengths that will have us counting the days until part two slow start  senstational ending  a decent job  no the lord of the rings  but no the phantom menace either virtuous  authentic heroes have a way of making more heroes as they journey on  whether across a movie screen or the pages of a beloved book there is a good deal to be said about peter jackson s long awaited and exceedingly long adaptation of j r r  tolkien s the hobbit  most of it bad there were extended sequences when my eyes literally could not track the action  sense of space was demolished  motion swamped the screen the  lotr  films have become so iconic and undeniably definitive  that it s often anticlimactic in  the hobbit  to hear grand characters saying new sentences in new settings   peter jackson s  efforts to filter or self edit   assuming there were any   remain fruitless a bloated  entirely unnecessary cash grab prequel suffering from a fatal case of elephantitis you may have seen middle earth before  but you haven t been in middle earth peter jackson s  the hobbit  an unexpected journey  has made it possible for you to feel like you re surrounded by the astonishing environment created by j r r  tolkien with the first film pushing three hours  purists will be pleased  less die hard audiences will find a lot of meandering set up   albeit visually gorgeous meandering setup remember the joke that the fellowship of the ring was just a bunch of people walking around for three hours  in this case  it s actually true an occasionally entertaining but empty fantasy epic   it rambles over hill and dale and mountain and field and forest and marsh and through cavern and catacomb and grotto and pothole   but will please the tolkien faithful it s like we returned to disneyland to find it looking as magical as ever  but with most of the rides closed  there are worse ways to kill time  sure  it s just that there is  alas  so much time to kill unexpected journey  runs nearly three hours  that gives jackson plenty of time to revive its magic  which he does  by triggering our good will toward the  rings  trilogy  he evokes the trilogy s tone and its rhythms as great as serkis is  he can t begin to make  the hobbit  look anything but short the odd thing about the saying  too much of a good thing  is that it acknowledges the fact that  something  in general  is composed of an overabundance of excellence the hobbit may not be as memorable as the lord of the rings trilogy  but it s a mostly faithful adaptation that sticks to the same tones and themes of the source material it s a journey that any fan of peter jackson s  the lord of the rings  trilogy should enjoy peter jackson s return to middle earth feels familiar and unfulfilling if jackson had focused simply on bilbo s party and their attempts to get a proper homeland for the dwarves   the hobbit  an unexpected journey  would have been a leaner  more engaging tale an unexpected journey offers an unparalleled visual spectaclea drag down  mildly diverting entertainmentwhen the dwarves turn up mob handed  kicking off a night of boisterous revelry  the laboured jests and jollity seem to go on forever  and the combination of dwarves  forced humour and familiar faces off the telly turn the occasion into bad panto the hobbit  an unexpected journey had me with the dulcet melancholy of displaced dwarves  yearning to be home slower out of the gates than a three legged donkey    but it gets better  and fans won t mind this slowburn beginning because  hey  it s middle earth it s the behaviour of the supposedly affable dwarves that makes this particular  adventure  such a punishing experience the hobbit  an unexpected journey is a story stretched too thin  dragged out by drudging slowness and obvious padding that its handful of thrilling action sequences can t improve  should more than satisfactorily scratch the itch of those who have waited many long years to see middle earth back on screen a marvel of filmmaking wizardry and engrossing adventure storytelling  the hobbit  an unexpected journey marks another triumph by director peter jackson who once again takes j r  tolkien s words and brings them to life with skilful  passionate expertise the hobbit occupies that same awkward spot in popular cinema as the twilight movies in terms of balancing good cinema against fan service here s hoping jackson s love affair with technology shifts back to his real strength good old fashioned storytelling and that he has the courage to edit down the film disappointing  isn t the same thing as  bad lacking the interesting characters and intriguing subplots that made the earlier trilogy so engaging  the hobbit  an unexpected journey is too flat  too slow a vibrant vision but a long slog like the sad  bug eyed gollum  moviegoers may not have realized how much they missed movies like this onscreen in the past several years  the absolute highlight  the return of andy serkis  master of motion capture performance  as the scary  disturbing  pathetic gollum a wild and visually stunning quest through a fantasy world all done with the noble spirit of courage and goodwill for what it s worth  the first installment of the hobbit hits all the right notes and delivers what will be expected of itrepetitive and pointless action scenes fill out an already bloated runtime  but not to the level of indulgence that we saw on  king kong  for thousands  the lord of the rings trilogy was an emotion filled spectacle  the hobbit  by comparison  is all pixels and no pulse wax your hyperbole all in all i think of it as the hobbit  a better than expected journey  the hobbit  is another ambitious  gorgeous and faithful trip into jrr s writing   and because of this  it won t win any new fans if you had no patience ten years ago  for those who do  you ll definitely want to go there and back again an unexpectedly great start to the prequel to  lotr   peter jackson strikes again my biggest complaint about this latest adventure in middle earth is that it is three hours worth of set up for the next movie much as with lotr  the casting is a strength this first chapter of peter jackson s new tolkien trilogy takes us back to the familiar settings and characters  inflating a simple journey into an epic adventure in the process peter jackson didn t particularly want to direct the hobbit  and i didn t particularly want to be bored to tears  but there we both were  fulfilling what could only be described as some sort of cinematic murder suicide pact butter spread over too much bread  bilbo might say despite its bloated length and meandering plot  this is still an enjoyable production  at least for fans of peter jackson  middle earth and j r r  tolkien it does what so few sequels prequels do  making you hungry for the next of the series  while still making you appreciate very much what has come before peter jackson seems keenly aware of the differences between the hobbit and the lord of the rings  and instead of trying to make one more like the other  he embraces what makes each story unique jackson seems to be going through the motions of epic fantasy filmmaking in his desire to tell this story in the most comprehensive manner possible  jackson seems to have forgotten one of cinema s most pleasurable tricks  the ability to cut to the chase this is a hobbit cobbled together by an obsession with technological ingenuity at the expense of storytelling simply  if you re a fan of the way jackson has delivered middle earth to you in the past  then this is more of the same   visually it is sometimes amazing  but it is a large troll step down from the last trilogy entertaining  but just when a good thing becomes too much of a good thing will vary from viewer to viewer for better or worse this is no longer j r r  tolkien s hobbit it has become peter jackson s hobbit  lots of talking  walking and singing  hard to take the villains seriously when they all sound like high pitched singing versions of elmer fudd  instead of simply adapting tolkien s novel  jackson has opted to use the story as a jumping off point for a convoluted prequel that threatens to do for middle earth what george lucas s star wars prequels did for a galaxy far  far away this is hobbit cordial  one part juice to nine parts water i prefer my movies to be more entertainment than ordeal  well  that was the longest video game trailer i have ever seen  no  seriously  are you going to show the real film now  it frequently seems as though jackson was less interested in making the hobbit than in remaking his own fabulously successful lord of the rings series not all the scenes are necessary  and a great deal of the movie is set up  with jackson reveling in his own return to middle earth  but it s an enjoyable experience happily  despite all the technical details   the hobbit  an unexpected journey  is exciting  tantalizing and satisfying while this film is way too long and might be more for tolkien devotees than mainstream audiences  after a slow start it turns into a rousing adventure with plenty of visual flair and top notch action sequences precisely what an adventure epic should be  huge  long  and lots of fun two thirds is so packed with charming characters  stellar visuals and sense of adventure  it makes that other third come across as much more of a failure than it really is a few extemporaneous lord of the rings elements distract from the hobbit storyline but jackson has presented a captivating and exciting return to middle earth this first installment should draw a large audience  getting it back for rounds two and three will be more difficult there are so few directors who can convincingly create a fantasy world that i applaud jackson for continuing to make middle earth a travel destination we still love to visit    even if the journey is becoming less direct despite some minor missteps  watching it feels like welcoming an old friend into your home  he may ramble a bit and slightly overstay his welcome  but hanging out with him reminds you of why you re friends in the first place a promising start  are the creatures amazingly rendered  yes  have we seen their lifelike equal onscreen before  no my first thought in watching the hobbit was  do we really need this movie  it was my last thought  too to its own narrative detriment   the hobbit  works hard to lay the framework for what will follow  certainly that s one way to set out on a trilogy  but it s surely not the best nearly three hours  and the story has progressed only slightly  nothing is short and sweet here  not even the identities  it s always thorin  son of theraflu  son of thong  etc tolkien tale isn t as great as lotr  but better for tweens jackson s risky creative choices have drained bilbo baggins  adventure of its magic it s all fight scenes  and the fight scenes have no arc  you just sit there waiting for some inevitable deus ex machina to save the day whenever peter jackson feels like it  the characters have no agency  it s like watching a kid play with his gi joes by no means a disaster  the hobbit mixes thrills with disappointmentstolkein geeks rejoicefantasy fans hungry for a second breakfast of tolkien fueled fare can get their fill with this visually sumptuous feast peter jackson catches a nasty case of george lucas itis with his latest middle earth saga there s no denying the majesty in peter jackson s visuals but he s taken a relatively slim children s book and stretched it beyond the limits sad to say   the hobbit  an unexpected journey  is a pale shadow trying to reach the sun on the strength of the  lord of the rings  trilogy in his attempt to produce a definitive  enhanced strength version of the text  jackson has stripped away much of the fun  a great deal of the energy and most of the humour what it all comes down to is that if you in any way  shape or form enjoyed the  lord of the rings  movies then you must see  the hobbit   many happy returns yet another battle filled and self indulgent film by peter jackson with each successive set piece  the movie grows more and more rousing a minor flaw or two but assuming you don t spend all of your days barefoot like a hobbit  the movie will knock your socks off  the reason it s so hard to immerse yourself in the world of middle earth again isn t how peter jackson filmed  the hobbit   it s what he filmed  a hugely enjoyable set up for what looks set to be another thrilling trilogy jackson has delivered plenty more of the big setpieces that fans loved in the trilogy  albeit at the cost of making the hobbit far more imperial and epic than it needs to be jackson has come back to middle earth to compose his most masturbatory effort yet this has to go down as the most disappointing film of the year it would be wrong to ignore the technical achievement that jackson has pulled off yet again  but when said and done   the hobbit  feels more like a cinematic encyclopedia of tolkein s mythical world rather than a trip to the movies the hobbit  an unexpected journey is a visual feast with whimsy and charm the repeated iterations of fight  flight and respite here get wearing  especially perhaps because  with jackson s fetish for detail  they take more time to watch on screen than to read about the hobbit  an unexpected journey  has finally arrived  not on wings of gossamer fancy but with a hairy footed thud hems and haws with only an occasional cinematic punch  making it a good  but very expected journey  not what you might have been expecting  or hoping for a well made spectacle that makes up for overall lacking story and character development with one incredible action scene after the next jackson himself seems to miss the forest of the story for the literal trees moments of brilliance and moments of boredomthose expecting the hobbit to be on the same level as lord of the rings are only setting themselves up for disappointment  but if you just go in expecting a fun adventure  you should be able to enjoy it  just don t see it in the higher frame rate if this were green eggs and ham  the film would stop at approximately the point at which you would not eat them with a fox one possibility is that the main thing to recommend the film is nostalgia  but so be it gets off to a decent start for this next trilogy  but it s not the epic  genre redefining event of the one that preceded it the overgenerous running time is somewhat to the film s advantage  but there are warning signs that jackson might be stretching the tale to its limit the hobbit  an unexpected journey is a lot like that beat up car you have sitting in the driveway  it doesn t always accelerate when it should  but once it gets going it s more reliable than anything the hobbit  an unexpected journey     is clumsy where tolkien s book is streamlined    filling in the gaps where the novel is vague   just because you can do three movies doesn t mean you need to do three movies with approximately six more hours to go  it s tough not to shudder at the sheer lengths director peter jackson is about to go to stretch this story into paper thin taffy if the hobbit  an unexpected journey is any indicator of things to come  this trilogy could be every bit as wondrous and exciting as the one that preceded it an overlong adventure enlivened by wonders guess what is unexpected about this journey  nothing  as there isn t one surprise in watching this continuation of the cinematic telling of j r r  tolkien s middle earth tales an unexpected journey is a major comedown  a muddle headed and cumbersome piece of filmmaking that betrays jackson s mercenary motives    tolkien s book  too if you loved the earlier films  these are moments you will hold on to  but they re very few  and they re not enough once again  jackson proves adept at capturing the tone and feel of middle earth  and the film takes us along familiar trails to meet some of our old friends i trust jackson s instincts with tolkien s work  it s his editorial indifference that could pose a greater threat to the hobbit than any attack from smaug part one of director peter jackson s planned film trilogy of j r r  tolkien s the hobbit forces audiences to run an obstacle course before the fun kicks in between its lighter tone and a decade s worth of improvements in digital film techniques  there should be enough of a novelty factor to delight most fans the tone of jackson s latest is  appropriately  much more jovial than that of rings  which unfolds in an era far more stricken with despair i was impressed with how much of the story s good humor jackson and co  manage to weave into the spectacle  it s there in the close shave with a gang of hungry trolls  and it really lifts off once andy serkis  uncanny gollum enters the picture those early scenes in the shire and the story of the loss of the dwarf kingdom establish character and purpose and give reason to hope and care that  like a talented sports team with a losing record  things can get only better a major disappointment that is about as difficult to swallow as the denny s meals that are among the avalanche of commercial tie ins that have accompanied its release  fun  though more than a little trying time will tell if this is a new peter jackson cash cow or just a bridge too far the film is frequently gorgeous  technologically adventurous and eventually thrilling tolkien s inventive  episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle even at their eye filling best  these sequences generate more spectacle than suspense once the adventure is finally underway  and martin freeman s meek hero starts to come into his own  jackson digs in and delivers an appropriately epic companion piece to his earlier trilogy once it gets going  it s actually quite fun this movie is about drawing things out as much as possible to make a snack size story feel like a meal the last hour of this movie is pretty much nonstop  and it s a gas little about the storytelling suggests a beating heart beneath the visuals  once the journey has begun  the characters find themselves in life threatening danger with stupefying regularity jackson s biggest failing with the first installment of the hobbit is that he crowds out a great story with such minor plot developments that carry no immediate importance to the movie or characters seeing the hobbit is like going to a timeshare presentation  first you have to sit through the boring stuff before you can take advantage of the spectacular benefits jackson imposes a sense of grandeur but mostly loses tolkien s sense of fun this is not about a reluctant hero drawing courage from some deep personal well  it s not about dread and danger  it s about visual effects the hobbit  an unexpected journey  is not the worst film of the year  but it may be the most disappointing the hobbit  an unexpected journey looks like the start of another blockbuster trilogy i m afraid that whoever it was in the new york film critics circle who voted for  the hobbit  as best animated film had a point  and so did the people who suspected that this whole thing was a bad idea watching the hobbit was an unexpected endurance test  younger children will not last the pace  but plucky ten year olds with a couple of well timed toilet breaks will lap this up  rather than an epic continuation of jackson s middle earth obsession  the film seems more like the work of a man driving around a multilevel parking garage without being able to find the exit a bloated  dull mess of a film that meanders when it should move and stumbles when it should run get ready for a more heated debate than any election season  is peter jackson s ambitious  overblown adaptation worth it  or is it a flagrant attempt to create a cash cow out of a children s book  the answer is yes if you re going to a see a nearly three hour movie based on a fraction of a popular book  make it  lincoln  as fun as it is to watch  this isn t tolkien s hobbit  the story of a peaceable traveler who knew the virtue of restraint is lost to the vision of filmmakers who have none the unhappy truth  is  that this return visit to middle earth is a bloated letdown the film is worthy of both your attention and of the tolkien legendarium in which jackson  his actors and his weta workshop technical crew are so firmly situated at nearly three hours long   an unexpected journey  has moments when the caravan seems both overstuffed and out of balance  but it s such a scenic trip that only a stubborn homebody could complain    for the faithful  for everyone else  it will probably prove the same as any long journey  periods of discovery and excitement countered with long stretches of boredom it is great to once more be whisked back to tolkien s extraordinarily vivid world  but jackson s overstuffed film proves that it is possible to get too much of a good thing  to gaze upon the film  like frodo staring into that prophetic magic orb  is to be shaken by a dark vision of cinema s future is it crunchable  is it scrumptious  the best awful looking film i have ever seen as entertaining as watching the last bits of ketchup drip out of the bottle bloated   overlong  even shakespeare needs editing features terrific performances  stunning action sequences and some state of the art special effects  but it s also far too long    i m here to vouch for jackson  except for the length almost all highlights and bombast  with little if any room for subtlety or poetry when  in jackson s film  someone describes a character s  love of gold  as having become  too fierce   you wonder if the warning might apply to  the hobbit  in other ways at its best  it recaptures the rings movies  breadth  detail  and staggering sense of beauty often entertaining  especially for those fans who loved the lord of the rings and have been waiting years to see more of tolkien s middle earth onscreen peter jackson definitely knows what he s doing  he just didn t do it this time peter jackson has formally moved away from the artistic act of directing  and into the business of creating synthetic movie  product   does an unexpected journey do a satisfactory job bringing audiences back to middle earth  the answer is  yes    if not as resolutely as i may have hoped   and the film is absolutely worth seeing for this quality alone the  elements are in place again  but the story feels less substantial than the lord of the rings tales solid and acceptable instead of soaring and exceptional   and  unnecessarily hampered in its quest to reach the magical heights of the trilogy it all just takes so long regardless of the frames  dimensions  or goggles used to conjure it   the hobbit  an unexpected journey  is an incredible ride and a triumphant return to middle earth packed with crescendos and crap outs  peter jackson s mega bloated beginning to bilbo baggins  pilgrimage across middle earth to lonely mountain both awes and bores decent enough fantasy adventure  but it doesn t especially feel like tolkien the hobbit  becomes what it was originally meant to be   not a cut from the same cloth prequel  but its own  individual thing  a  dazzling  busy  fundamentally tedious movie    it s a shame to see peter jackson treading water when there are so many new cinematic horizons worth exploring i found that it provided a pretty convincingly immersive experience  and i look forward to the technology s evolution refinement  which i guess also means i look forward to the next two installments of the trilogy in a bit of irony  bilbo baggins says at the end of the movie   i do believe the worst is behind us   we can only hope so the board is set  the pieces are moving and we re set up nicely for jackson to tighten the noose with the love of second act grit he displayed in the two towers the more dark it becomes  the more  the hobbit  becomes compelling as a story  and finds a fitting tone the hobbit  is an impressive first chapter even though this installment is mostly a prelude  jackson s eccentric mixture of low humor  earnest foreboding and digitally processed pageantry is consistently engaging and immersive piles on enough eye candy and action sequences to please fans  plus more humor than the three  rings  films   even if it only occasionally achieves the trio s grandeur if peter jackson couldn t tell this slight story in a single film there s no hope the other two in this prequel series will be any less bloated it s a promising start   but where it s going to in the two remaining movies is anybody s guess the hobbit may be a different story to the lord of the rings     but there is really nothing all that unexpected about this journey i found myself concentrating more on the strange look of the film and less on the film itself while fans of j r r  tolkien s novels and the lord of the rings movies will find plenty to enjoy and marvel over  non believers may find themselves getting bored and bemused by the unnecessarily drawn out story where the format comes into its own is in intense  action packed territory  an unexpected journey s battle sequences are especially striking where the format comes into its own is in intense  action packed territory  an unexpected journey s battle sequences are especially striking an unexpected journey is a bit ropey  excessive and padded in places  sure  but if that s the worst and the best is yet to come  then this could end up being another great trilogy what s all this add up to  not terribly much it s not as good as i hoped  but it s also a lot better than i feared thankfully  jackson s flair for action sequences and bold and complex production design hasn t deserted him viewers have come to expect visceral combat between characters who feel tangible in their appearance and reactions  but there s none of that here on balance  honor has been done to tolkien  not least in the famous riddle game between bilbo and gollum  and some of the exploits to come will surely lighten the load an unexpected journey is a competent  entertaining effort but it neither enthralls nor amazes in the way its predecessors did  m ore than a bit like slogging through overly completist volumes of fan fiction  and that is going to bore more casual moviegoers  and also some serious fans   the hobbit plays younger and lighter than fellowship and its follow ups  but does right by the faithful and has a strength in martin freeman s bilbo that may yet see this trilogy measure up to the last one  there is treasure here the lord of the rings trilogy  has  been replaced by something that resembles tatty summer stock theater peter jackson returns to the middle earth he rendered so faithfully in lord of the rings  and it s never looked so glorious the real triumph of the hobbit is that peter jackson leaves you wanting more jackson has made the hobbit with brio and fun  and martin freeman is just right as bilbo baggins  he plays it with understatement and charm as a lover of cinema  jackson s film bored me rigid  as a lover of tolkien  it broke my heart emotionally rewarding  imaginatively detailed and made with a genuine sense of joy  the first hobbit chapter succeeds despite its structural and formatting mis steps peter jackson triumphantly returns to middle earth with the hobbit  an unexpected journey  a folksy  beguiling adventure  we get to enjoy the splendor of the story and fantastic settings in a more whimsical experience grandiose and visually spectacular  although the visual effects overwhelm the narrative an unexpected journey has so many pay offs that most are likely to re engage with the saga  once these dwarves  accompanied by bilbo and gandalf  hit the road  the film takes off and doesn t come down until the credits roll  even once bilbo and company take to the hobbit highway  the pacing is leisurely verging on lethargic    the movie lacks majesty  grand in parts  the movie is too often grandiose or grandiloquent  and the running time is indefensible the lord of the rings trilogy behind him  peter jackson has begun yet another  this time adapting the tolkien epic  the hobbit  the first chapter of jackson s new trilogy is decent  if not enirely satisfying  bound to suffer from inevitable comparisons with the superior  oscar winning lord of the rings peter jackson s return to swords  sorcery and beards deserving of their own postcodes is fantasy how it ought to be this film is pure excess that s almost definitely motivated by studio greed  but it s light entertainment that will please fans  and andy serkis damn near runs away with the film during his exemplary third act appearance as gollum tolkien s brisk story of intrepid little hobbit bilbo baggins is drawn out and diluted by dispensable trimmings better left for dvd extras fulfilling just a fraction of j r r  tolkien s  there and back again  subtitle  the hobbit alternately rewards and abuses auds  appetite for all things middle earth where jackson might occasionally misstep tonally  he takes the reigns from the episodic original and runs with generally fantastic results through several narrative additions  all of which give the characters more agency in their own affairs while jackson hasn t delivered a hit on par with his  lord of the rings  movies   the hobbit  proves he can still do justice to the tricky blend of fantasy and action that made the earlier entries such enjoyable works of popular entertainment there are elements in this new film that are as spectacular as much of the rings trilogy was  but there is much that is flat footed and tedious as well  especially in the early going setting aside technological considerations  the hobbit is nothing short of a joyous homecoming an unexpected journey may as well be the phantom menace and god help us all if the next two movies aren t better than this one it s not as bad as you feared  but not as good as you hoped  peter jackson s fourth trip to middle earth can t quite recapture the greatness  emotional impact or charm of the lotr films  but there s still much to enjoy about the hobbit  an unexpected journey for now   the hobbit  an unexpected journey  is a good start  but with the expectations resting on the film  is good going to be good enough  a fresh  free spirited form of fantasy  jackson s latest provides a younger generation with a stepping stone to his later films while serving the adult s who want more  unless your dreams are populated by denizens of middle earth  endless footage of them simply talking or walking is a lot less spectacular than peter jackson thinks it is a briskly engaging adventure shrouded in superfluous detail  though also  yes  admittedly  technical virtuosity  it s an accomplished if unexciting first chapter in the preamble to his oscar winning film series for its occasional moments of excess and unhurried pace  an unexpected journey is proof that jackson still has a knack for stories in this world the hobbit  an unexpected journey is more fun than the fellowship of the ring  no doubt about it tolkien could invent names and languages  but he couldn t create a plot at gunpoint  this film stands ably on its own  offering up generous piles of large scale fantasy underscored by genuine emotional heft and boundary pushing visuals the movie itself is a lot of fun  and if you can separate yourself from the visual distraction  you ll find plenty to enjoy vital as they are  gollum and bilbo can only do so much to keep us enchanted  is jackson able to sustain the magic in two more installments  i peer into tolkien s misty mountains and embrace the journey was mostly shocked by vince vaughan  who showed me for the first time that he wasn t the long delayed immature frat boy he so often plays  but actually an imperfect hilarious  yet often silly  character who s main flaw is his selfishness the break up is a funny and light comedy  but it tries to be something a bit more without being something a bit more  hampered by shoddy characterization  ending up a bit empty the two stars remain painfully wrong for each otheris anxious to be a modern  annie hall   but really it is just a tedious  glum  and god awful affair the break up  comes with a slap and a kiss that s at once bracing and pleasing a word of caution to anyone heading off to see the break up with the assumption that it is a romantic comedy  this is not a comedy movie with a serious side    it is a serious movie with a comedic side stereotypes across the board  puerile one upmanship games  and an utter failure to explain why  indeed  these two even were together high aimed intentions are thrown askew by the reliance on inconsistent laughs seemingly meant to break the otherwise overriding tension right up there with the best of the revenge genre  and earns praise from this critic for its sophisticated brand of humor which kept me in stitches from start to finish not even the tacked on ending  hinting at some future sparks between brooke and gary  can lighten the sturm und drang in this break up     the break up  may go down with  fatal attraction  as the worst  date  movie of all time full review in greekthere s nothing broken about the break up  which turns rom com conventions on their side in free wheeling fashion  and in doing so colorfully  wittily celebrates what it is about men and women that both attract one another and drives us crazy a romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor particularly funny a little broken  but worth the viewing  i t combines a naked desire to please the audience with a try anything approach of the kind that made wedding crashers such a desperate stab at entertainment it s still very much a quick and painless hollywood production  what slight genius there is in its premise dulled by the sheen of the high production values and its prettier than pretty cast it s never less than entertaining and the chemistry between our two leads  whatever their personal circumstances  really holds things together this is that branch of the romantic comedy known as  a relationship movie   but generally short on witty lines and amusing incidents the break up doesn t turn the rom com on its head  but with its focus on the darker side of love manages to gently tip it on its side sharp dialogue and detailed observations make it a good deal funnier than you might expect while consistently funny  the break up deals in bitterness and revenge  sometimes in ways that cut closer to the bone than most fluffy romantic comedies think less wedding crashers and more war of the roses minus the oddly romantic violence breaking up may be hard to do  and it s not so easy to watch  either like the story of many broken down relationships  despite the initial attraction  you re left feeling cheated this   break up  is  unfortunately  hard to do star power is an interesting thing  especially when it goes wrong delivers something worthwhile to those open minded enough to be able to settle with wild shifts between average satire and grounded pathosit s not a good sign when a movie is called the break up and you can t wait for the couple to split so they ll get some relief from one another  and give the audience some relief from them one seemingly terminal problem with the casting of ms  aniston and mr  vaughn is that neither of their careers has featured characters who excelled at one to one relationships with the opposite sex it fails because it neglects to create characters we care about nil chemistry  how can vaughn and aniston be dating  they don t even like each other  every bit as unpleasant as it sounds  but the film s intentions are to examine a separation  and the story achieves its set goals an extended sit com played for laughs  with little to redeem itself  the two central characters are not the only ones who wish things had been different  i  for one  would have liked to laugh  or cry  or at least be entertained  oh  did you want to see a jennifer aniston romantic comedy  life isn t always about hollywood expectations  let s cut jennifer some slack and enjoy her doing good work in an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality  the break up offers a refreshing flipside the behavior of the two main charactres exists solely to be  cute   while giving us no reason to believe these two people should be together in the first place it s frustrating  but it s real tensions predictably escalate and we re forced to spend the rest of the movie pretending like we care if these two annoying slices of wonder bread end up together this is a tragedy with laughs  not a comedy     comes apart at the seams  the victim of irreconcilable differences between vaughn s schtick and the flimsy script you end up hoping the serial killer from see no evil will wander over from a neighboring auditorium and pluck out their eyes just to make it stop     at least it ends on a more positive note than closer   with nothing genuine invested in either character  we can focus fully on how bland and churlish they are go in expecting a romantic comedy  and you ll be disappointed  go in expecting a grueling dissection of a relationship that should never have started  and you might find it interesting i m not sure what it was trying to deliver  and i don t think director peyton reed knows either vaughn  who has fooled hollywood into thinking he s a real actor  has two basic styles  motor riff quickly through dialogue or stand still and imitate a brick  the only really nice thing about the story is that it doesn t opt for a hollywood happy ending vaughn is a guy s guy kind of actor    his characters are more comfortable shooting pool or knocking back beers than getting romantic on the couch    so it s no surprise that the chemistry he generates is with favreau rather than aniston the most interesting so far of this summer s blockbuster disappointments  the film s willingness to buck audience expectations and at least try for something tougher makes it an admirable failure  this is a deeply conservative movie  not conservative in a political way but conservative in a ward and june cleaver kind of way   vince vaughn kills me  jennifer aniston  i think  is underrated as a film actress  the break up  sticks to its guns    interpret the title literally    and is refreshingly better for it amusing at times  but neither the story nor the lead actors give us enough to care or laugh about  the break up  breaks down in the endthe emotional thread is unpleasant from beginning to end with the occasional comical quip sporadically thrown in a misguided comedy that relies on obnoxious characters and mean  abrasive behavior one of the things that is most intriguing about the break up is how it shows the cruelty that people can inflict upon one another as soon as love fades the whole movie is a game of one upsmanship  as each one tries to make the other more miserable  it gets increasingly ugly and painful  then it ends at least one draft short of brilliance     but  more palatable than the typical romantic comedy  thanks in large part to vaughn s engaging duets with the ensemble what starts out as a doris day rock hudson romantic comedy morphs into  who s afraid of virginia woolf  when  oh when  will the scorching on screen chemistry between vince vaughn and jon favreau finally be consummated a rare category of date movie  we wish it played more like other date movies is the break up worth your time  let s put it this way  whenever vaughn is onscreen  it is  when he s not  it ain t there s something admirably perverse about the break up  a movie that wants to jolt the tired romantic comedy genre by getting rid of the romance their ongoing one upmanship is awkward  juvenile  and not especially funny  yet underscored by so much honest pain you understand    if not condone    gary and brooke s desperate actions in the break up  men are slobs  women are passive aggressive  and viewers opposed to broad brush strokes for either gender are sorely out of luck the movie is barely stenciled as a story  the romance never gains enough focus or momentum to make its crisis even comically involving the movie offers nothing funny  just a series of sour situations a love it or hate it mainstream romantic comedy in that makes a frill free connection with its audience  whether that audience wants it or not  there s nothing wrong with something that delivers belly laughs before striking at gut level there s no reason not to see the break up  but there s also no reason  assuming the date is going well  not to skip it and order dessert sour and unsavory  rather than a black comedy  it s a bleak comedy it s the most interesting spin on domestic strife since michael douglas and kathleen turner were hurling dishes at each other in the war of the roses what ultimately makes the break up so good and refreshing is its firm denial of the  chick flick  stamp of approval brooke and gary articulate their discontent with considerable precision and occasional verve  it s that they haven t figured out a way to make emotional torment funny  which is the tall order inherent in anti romantic comedy in short  the break up is too accurate to be light hearted  too light and flippant to be really romantic here s a movie that s not worth getting all broken up about  or for that matter  going broke to see a romantic comedy that s short on both romance and comedy the fun parts of this movie actually occur when the two leads are not with each other but in their respective corners preparing for the next round what looks like a raucous frat boy comedy is really a surprisingly canny depiction of a stagnant relationship with a movie unwilling to go for the jugular  it s more like the dismal the story of us than the war of the roses i don t know if the break up qualifies as a date movie  but it will serve as a cautionary tale for couples falling in love listening to people bicker for almost two hours wears thin  especially when the comedy is never quite so funny as you had hoped it would be it s the movie s wobbly tone and its betrayal of its characters in the name of niceness that dooms the break up into being a film that will satisfy no one    not even the bottom line thinkers it s hamhandedly squeezed through the hollywood rom com template  resulting in a movie as moribund as the relationship it portrays for all that goes wrong with the break up  the most compelling question it raises has to do with the state of the romantic comedy during a cynical  prepackaged  reality tv moment it might not be the frosted lemon tart that s been advertised for months  but it is solid  satisfying fare    flecked with humor  grounded in pain the break up goes badly wrong  although possessed of a laudable desire not to be yet another run of the mill  wacky impediment    damned if the picture can figure out how to be an anti romance comedy as an off beat anatomy of a troubled couple  the film almost succeeds  as summer movie fun well  it s not if you really feel the need to be bullied and insulted  just call up your hmo provider or reserve a table at an expensive restaurant this plot provides plenty of material  but director peyton reed and first time screenwriters jeremy garelick and jay lavender pack the film with characters and subplots that don t really go anywhere it doesn t work as a revealing look at relationships or as a consistently funny comedy about the war between the sexes a serviceable bit of relationship fluff buoyed by a couple of well tuned performances from aniston and vaughn like so many contemporary movies  the break up doesn t know when to call it quits  and the film finally expires after several false endings the break up is a pleasant surprise to the open minded director peyton reed really does seem to be trying to probe for something more worthy  to find some insight into modern day relationships  but it simply isn t there the break up mostly just lies there    alternately adoring and condemning its characters for their puppyish refusal to grow up this is a very watchable film   not your standard rom com garbage akin to an unhealthy relationship  this self described  anti romantic comedy  begins hot and heavy before buckling beneath the weight of pointless conflicts and ridiculous game playing the comedy  for lack of a better description  is not funny  it is churlish  childish and petulant the break up is more like annie hall told with chicago attitude and work ethic it s not a relationship we become invested in  because all we see of it    are still photos over the opening credits there s something deviantly infectious about the twisted joy of revenge aniston has always done some of her best acting in reaction shots  and vaughn is a gold mine to react against  look  i m not talking about a masterpiece here  what i am talking about is a good film trying desperately to break out of the romantic comedy box and  for the most part  doing so while the situations are real and the dialogue is authentic   the break up  is mundane and trite it s at least trying to stay anchored in the real world  where cute couples don t always make up and walk hand in hand into the sunset vaughn and aniston have remarkable chemistry  and both do a masterful job expressing the realities of such a sad and painful experience it genuinely tugs at our heartstrings as we witness two people in the agonizing throes of a crumbling relationship    there s nothing terribly compelling about watching likable stars argue for close to two hours in spite of some laughs  and winning performances from jennifer aniston and vince vaughn  the break up is more likely to make audiences squirm than cheer the break up is so depressing  painful and awful to watch that i felt like i had just been through a bitter divorce myself nobody likes a fixed fight  except the backroom boys making the deal  which is why the break up may have its share of laughs  but isn t much fun the surprising thing about it is not how funny it is  as that s to be expected  but how serious it is  also surprising  it works the lack of climax and the ambiguous resolution cut closer to the bone than most summer fare  but the screenplay  by two writers making their feature debut  stays formulaic enough to never really draw blood it s full of pain and quirky characters standing at oblique angles to one another  and while it doesn t add up it held me throughout vince vaughn overreacting to pictionary will certainly be on his highlight reel at the next awards show    the greatest comedy is found in the deepest truths  and when the truth hurts  the experience can touch the full spectrum of emotion eventually you re just rooting for gary and brooke to get the whole ordeal over with  as much for the audience s sake as for their own the break up is ultimately a big budget heart heavy indy film  and not a slapstick broad comedy as the ads would have you think   break up could be viewed as the ultimate romantic comedy  the rare picture that makes one thank heaven for all the good relationships they ve managed to luck into i think it s courageous    it s something we re not used to seeing from this category of movies these days  a stark honesty is presented here don t expect to crack up at the break up just because performers click romantically off screen doesn t mean you need to pay good money to watch them in movies that are less interesting than the stories they inspire in supermarket tabloids he likes social distortion  she likes alanis morrissette  and quite frankly  either  ball and chain  or  isn t it ironic  are both better takes on the modern relationship a decaffeinated and imbalanced war of the roses where the occasional funny riff from vaughn attempts to distract us from material which is far more familiar than he believes the break up is much like a real relationship as it starts off all hilarious and fun  but you are tearing your hair out by the end you ll be wishing they d just call it quitsthe break up can t work because it denies its protagonist his humanity  and us the pleasure of watching human characters do at least vaguely human things a brilliantly conceived romantic comedy reversal that turns the genre on its head if you value your time and your relationship  don t see this on a date the filmmakers have wildly miscalculated the chemistry these real life lovers generate on film the break up doesn t know whether it wants to be a facile  enjoyable date movie or an unnerving examination of the dark  pockmarked underbelly of everything we expect out of romantic relationships    a gloomy mishmash of ideas that never comes together and is hardly ever fun to watch an eye for the devil in the details gives the story its heart    a broken heart  but that s better than none at all the break up is a refreshingly different romantic comedy  one that doesn t so much rely on gimmicks as on digging around for genuine feelings director peyton reed doesn t quite bring the sharpness  litheness and attention to detail he brought to bring it on and down with love to the break up  which is nonetheless alternately funny and painful  not  a bad film  merely a mismarketed one   a sad little valentine from mars to venusthe summer s biggest disappointment   though hardly the worst movie   so far  if  as the ads would lead you to believe  you go to see the break up expecting a romantic comedy  you will be severely disappointed  if you go to it expecting a good movie  you will also be severely disappointed peyton reed s the break up proves there is nothing particularly funny or charming about two people splitting up  even if the couple is played by vince vaughn and jennifer aniston as anticlimactic as an actual breakup  without any of the passion  the anger or the glimmers of hope that come from gradually parting with someone you love terrific supporting cast with eccentric characters lifts this comedy above the norm  vaughn s rapid fire delivery of witty stream of consciousness dialogue really scores for all of its comedic nosedives  the film is frank and uncompromising as a study of the final weeks of a relationship a sporadically funny comedy about a crisis in the relationship of a smiley couple who seem to think that life should be an endless run of happy days take the funny away from vaughn  and you ve got return to paradise  and nobody wants to see that she s identified almost entirely by her haircut at the end  just as the actress who plays her has been for much of her career it s a checklist of summer movie elements arranged with enough care to suggest that it should add up to more than a pleasant diversion a wishy washy little relationship comedy that s nowhere near as nasty as it evidently wants to be the break up is too badly fractured to be deemed repairable the break up is like an uncomfortable party that you can t wait to leave the movie s crazy insistence on going its own way shows flashes of genius until a cop out ending  this is war of the roses territory  where laughs take no prisoners watching these likable actors flounder around as they try to save a picture that s not worth saving is  well  depressing what s strange about the break up is that  despite the alleged deep love between gary and brooke  you never get the sense that much is at stake the break up fails to freshen the stale news that women are from venus and men are from mars to call it erratic would be to imply there was a course it went off  but the film s intentions are impossible to fathom  it s a romantic comedy in which the romance comes stillborn and in which the comedy barely exists you have no desire to see them either get back together or murder one another   you just want them to leave each other alone  and that s not exactly compelling cinema as neil sedaka famously observed  breaking up is hard to do  but it proves even harder to watch in this shrill  sour comedy    the film still clicked for me because it was set around a realistic situation to which many people can relate and was peppered with laughs and even some genuine emotion not a typical  formulaic  feel good romantic comedy   plays a bit like best friends for a younger generation when they break up  which happens pretty early in this self professed  anti romantic comedy   it doesn t seem tragic  it just makes sense the break up is being marketed as an  unconventional romantic comedy   but the only thing unconventional about it is that it s not romantic and it s not a comedy it s like watching the  we were on a break  episode of friends stretched to feature length   this one  in every sense  is fake a sometimes entertaining film  it just never gels a borderline schizophrenic tone regularly undercuts both the nasty  biting humor and weepy sentimentality their trademark good guy and girl blow their mutual affability in a dull show of falling apart ill conceived virtually from the opening frame as a self described  anti romantic comedy  after a promisingly quirky start  break up suffers a major breakdown from which it never recovers nannannannannannannanunmemorable  unfunny and unoriginal save for its dalliance with the everyman action movie  there s no surprises in paul blart  mall cop  another largely listless comedy from sandler s happy madison production company in places the plot sags a bit and some jokes don t quite hit their mark or tickle the funny bone as much as they re obviously meant to james is much better than a lot of his contemporaries at this  eschewing over the top clowning for actual humanity  but it all gets thrown out the window in the second half  maybe he ll do better next time neither good enough to to really cheer for nor bad enough to really care about trashing it  it exists in that room temperature middle where nothing feels like it matters    a hopelessly underwhelming comedy   unfunny  unoriginal and tedious   mall cop is successful only at living up to the standard set by past films that have begun with the words  a happy madison production  it s only almost the making of a comedy classic an unfunny comedy with a limited imagination and a steady diet of fat jokes the numerous making of featurettes includes a treat for those of us in eastern massachusetts with the burlington mall highlighted      a genial  inoffensive little comedy that coasts on the charm of its  king of queens  star james   what s most disappointing here is that kevin james appears capable of far more rich and subtle comedy than he s ever likely to be part of in a happy madison production i found myself really quite enjoying this film  partly for its cheerful guying of mall culture  the heroine  amy  works on a hair extension stand called unbeweavable there s no doubt that james is a fine comedic actor and the role of paul blart fits his big frame like a well worn glove  as writers  however  he and bakay rely too heavily on slapstick   james makes a funny  likeable doofus  and the expansion of his girth since his hit sitcom the king of queens is used to great comic effect men of a certain size will love paul blart   and his pursuit through the centre is remarkably inventive  truly for all the family although juvenile  predictable and utterly forgettable  has an endearing central character in kevin jameswith only some scattershot scenes of physical humor   paul blart  mall cop  does little to keep viewers safe from boredom to my surprise  once the action part of the story kicked in   paul blart  mall cop  transformed into a rather enjoyable comic adventure an  arresting  comedy  james  best work paul blart  mall cop is a tongue planted firmly in cheek force to be reckoned with a good natured  but awkward and often unfunny comedy that bounces from sad sack pathos to slapstick action parodyyou can t be too hard on a film that blows up a rainforest cafe  can you thanks to kevin james  earnest portrayal of an earnest guy  i was won over by the film s goofy charms i know this is january  the month where dreadful movies go to die  and i know we have to take what we can get  but this  spring has rarely seemed so far away i really  really like kevin james  but this is disappointing like a mall  has long stretches where you see nothing of interest and a generally stale air to it  unlike a mall  you can t just browse and then move on to a better section there s nothing quite like the words  happy madison productions  appearing on the screen to diminish my expectations concerning the movie about to unfold kevin james throws his weight around as the dedicated mall cop  but sometimes his actions are more silly than funny this isn t brain surgery  this is daffy entertainment that plays to its strengths  with director steve carr trusting in james  deadpan earnestyjames takes a segway  a cheesy mustache and the comic idea of die hard in a mall and bumbles his way to a lightweight but frequently funny film for the whole family james gives it everything he s got  totally committing to the character and delivering clean comedy which often times is often more difficult than creating just a raunch fest the hero is named for a disgusting bodily function that s hardly pg material  but the movie itself seems to be aimed at grade schoolers it s a trivial pursuit  slathered with peanut butter a couple of segway jokes stretched to an hour and a half running time    this is a masterpiece compared to anything rob schneider has put out only it suffers from the same form of stereotyping just one long pratfall   an avalanche of really dumb action comedy that aims to be a variant on the inspector clouseau formula but fails miserably mall cops everywhere should sue  the movie is trash i just love this guy   james says of paul blart in the movie s production notes  for the sake of humanity i hope and pray that barely anyone else shares his affection kevin james  slapstick comedy will amuse older tweens forget the rocky character development  give me a fat guy falling down  and i ll start to laugh the road from tv star to movie leading man is loaded with ill conceived films the last name blart may be the funniest thing in the movie  so that s a hint as to just how bad this shopping center saga can be it s surprisingly okay  in a january kind of way paul blart  mall cop is like the many variations on tuna surprise that show up at potlucks  generic but with a little something added to differentiate it as cheapo larks go  it s a winningly unassuming one  no stars  no big action set pieces  just a fat guy  a near empty mall  and a lot of really ridiculous ideas it s just not particularly funny  that segway  alas  only goes so far paul blart tepidly goes through its motions  but that doesn t mean you have to just as james struggles to make unfunny material tolerable  so too does the supporting cast fall flat directed by steve carr  a man who knows how to put a camera in front of things  if little else  and written  sort of  by nick bakay and mr  james it s a juvenile motion picture designed primarily for a juvenile audience  but there s a little more here than one might reasonably expect laughs occasionally ensue avoid this mall cop and just go shopping instead perfectly inoffensive and almost entirely unfunny  the film  oo often settles for easy  lazy jokes  most of which revolve around either food or running into stuff paul blart  mall cop is so inconsequential you forget about it even before the movie is over some people really love goofy comedy  and for those people there s paul blart  mall cop  you can bring the kids james  at his best when he lets loose  plays his character a little too straight and so loses some of the movie s comic potential sensationally stupid  haphazardly made and qualifying as unmitigated trash by any standards  paul blart  mall cop also manages to be consistently hilarious  thanks to star kevin james this comedy from adam sandler s happy madison production company takes itself too seriously for its own good surprisingly winning working from a script co written by james  the film feels like a die hard parody that s at least a decade too late  it s sophomoric and rudimentary  the whole thing offering so few laughs i almost fell asleep in the theater while watching it to call this kevin james comedy fatuous might be misinterpreted as an attack on the star s girth    so how about inane  tepid  lazy  puerile  phony  and unfunny it s unlikely that even wall e could bring himself to scoop up this movie and leave it on his post apocalyptic junk heap you might chuckle occasionally as the film drones on to a close  but mostly you ll be wondering when it will all end producer adam sandler must have though so little of the film that he didn t even see it fit for a rob schneider cameo    a silly film that exists primarily as a vehicle for james    this marks the emergence of a comedy star who may get to fulfill the promise he shows here in films to come oh my goodness  it s a ripoff of die hard  a shameless ripoff that gets more and more shameless the longer it goes on   paul blart delivers laughs  yes  but it s only one great slapstick actor and a little bit of heart away from being just another truly idiotic comedy never delivers the big laughs this star in this promising premise really should parental content reviewadept at physical comedy  kevin james    who co wrote the  paul blart  mall cop  script    emerges the king of his retail domain boring and predictable in both its narrative and its aesthetics  paul blart  mall cop is dumbed down  low rent slapstick with stereotypes galore and a violent undercurrent that doesn t sit well james  who co wrote  endows the title character with such piercing sweetness that even his geeky pretensions are endearing this dim bulb  family oriented slapstick film benefits greatly from james  knack for physical comedy  but it s ultimately too bland and uninspired    after a dismal first half hour  it changes from a piteous low intellect attempt at humor to a light hearted takeoff on bruce willis and the  die hard  movies unfathomably unfunny    centered around mean spirited fat jokesa senseless hollywood comedy not a bad premise  but most of the comedy just dies  hard  has  such obviously humble intentions that busting on it is a bit like harassing the junior high school outcast who just wants to eat his tater tots in peace a shamelessly sentimental comedy with a few crude gags thrown in arbitrarily unlike james himself  the movie is a few bricks shy of a load  which explains why a movie obviously ticketed for a holiday release has backed up to mid january the film is completely forgettable  frequently funny and weirdly satisfying in a jersey loser gets respect kind of way  james   remarkably winning performance turns blart into the ultimate underdog  a decent guy who s finally having the kind of day he deserves paul blart  mall cop is a slapstick comedy with a hero who is a nice guy  i thought that wasn t allowed anymore give this to paul blart  mall cop  it delivers on everything it promises  which is to say  nearly nothing somewhere beneath its mediocre comedic trappings  there s a decent action movie trying to fight its way free the end product won t win any oscars  but the edges of this slapstick action film retain james s blitzkrieg sense of humor  making for a light comic adventure i m positive kids will flip for if you are a kevin james fan you probably will want to see him rolling around  otherwise you can pass on this one to save a few bucks like the movie s sad sack hero  this comedy never comes close to achieving its real potential the thin comic appeal of kevin james is laid on a bit thicker in paul blart  mall cop  his first solo star vehicle for the big screen an almost shockingly amateurish one note joke comedy on which the star also shares writing and producing credit  kevin james  proves to be a warm leading man who grounds the movie as it morphs into a loopy heist thriller after a promising start as something entirely different  a gentle comedy of suburban underachievement tv s king of queens working stiff james relocates to jersey in an even larger than life silly but good natured big screen laughathon  as the corpulent crimefighter who s more than a little obsessive about cornering anyone shopping around for trouble james and mays are engaging and a handful of moments do generate genuine laughs  not enough to justify a paid night at the movies   the shot of blart quietly crawling into a hostage situation inside the mall s bank and walking through a roped line is a moment of absurd grace  only it s shot with the vulgarity of a crash test dummies commercial the talented cast works hard to keep this souffle from falling  because of roberts  america s sweethearts is going to be seen by a lot of people  for best results  keep those expectations low so so sitcom like story of estranged movie stars    an egregiously bland piece of work that ultimately makes certain sitcoms look deep by comparison lacking originality or true wit  this mildly amusing but utterly banal comedy again demonstrates that joe roth is not much of a director and that billy crystal can do only one thing as an actor  be billy crystal could have been more with such a great cast  but still manages to entertain it gets a little funnier toward the end  making up for the draggy first half       however  the shelf life of this sweetheart should be short indeed slight  but at least fitfully funny a loose limbed  occasionally funny movie of many madly spinning teacups sunk by uninvested in characters and niggling  wrongheaded details inevitably there are some funny moments  and of course this is an endlessly watchable cast  but the movie is just too over the top the film isn t just banal  it s aggressively  arrogantly banal when it peeks behind the scenes  the movie can be very  very funny a timely comedy that pokes fun at all things hollywood disappointment comes from the sense that the picture started off with the promise of being something different  maybe even something scathing  but then settles for something rather routine the fact that this movie contains some of the most annoying  mannered actors on film today and still remains painless is quite a feat its potential as a spicy spoof of hollywood s incestuous relation with the entertainment press has been ephroned away in favor of bland romantic comedy the writers turn out to be brandishing butter knives instead of scalpels      the movie s real surprise is the feisty  vigorous turn by zeta jones  who throws off zingers with grace and style the kind of flick that gives fluff a good name there have been a lot of movies about how fake hollywood is  but this is the fake hollywood movie about how fake hollywood is the premise falters along with much of the shtick joe roth steps back into the director s chair after nearly a decade and america s sweethearts suffers the same diffused focus that his earlier efforts  after the tightly paced opening  the film flounders until all the major players have been introduced the movie is intended as an effervescent fizz  instead  it s a fizzle  what should have been a knockout punch turns out to be more of a gentle poke in the ribs you have to suffer through the de facto miss america  julia roberts  pretending as though she s blending in with the furniture lo adorable de su elenco  lo divertido de su trama y su atractivo reparto  la hacen sumamente disfrutablethe script here is not funny  while the cast    though star studded    is perfunctory let me tell you the bottom line  the movie is cute and it s enjoyable america s sweethearts feels especially stupid for not offering azaria s casting as some sort of auto critique the so called  behind the scenes  intrigue often fails to rise above a television sitcom what happens when satire gets lazy both harmlessly cynical and deeply fatuous coming out the loser in the mess is joe roth  who shows that heading movie studios hasn t done any favors for whatever directorial ability he may have once had less a romantic comedy than a scathing commentary on the uselessness and inanity of everyone in hollywood the set up is slow and weak  but once it gets rolling  it works pretty well as plastic as the films it attempts to lampoon a tepid update of the screwball comedy formula with vaguely satiric overtonesamerica s sweethearts is a balloon  all right    a lead one it is ironic that while the film tries to demystify its celebrities by showing their  true  identities  it simultaneously creates a myth for the julia roberts character kiki as a hollywood satire  america s sweethearts is toothless  as a romance  it is at best a minor pleasure a boring  brain dead flop too cynically slick and emotionally shallow as a romantic comedy  america s sweethearts is atrocious  as a skewering of hollywood ego  it s actually quite funny the send up is doggedly unclever in its attention to the vagaries of fame  insecurities of famous people  and artifice of hollywood romance a lackluster screwball comedy and dubious julia roberts vehicle the film does indeed deliver the laughs  and i suppose we can t ask much more than that in these mediocre summer months the script     is crisp and fresh  the gags well aimed and nastily barbed gives us television sitcom like  onesa  characters     whose behavior seems prompted by whatever suits the scene rather than any kind of emotional truth a clunky ribbing of the movie industry takes aim at hollywood and delightfully surprises with a funny and entertaining film a major studio takes aim at itself in a series of mostly successful sketches parodying the underhanded ways movie companies have of marketing their fare if it wants to be a romance between  cusack and roberts   i ve seen more sparks fly between ostriches far too many scenes seem painfully contrived  go nowhere and just aren t humorous  it s silly  but not very funny a real crowd pleaser with laughs so big and often that you re going to miss some of the lines crystal and co  shoot for the cheapest laughs they can find  and ignore the tougher  smarter ones they might have discovered in so potentially rich a vein as hollywood s marketing practices just funny enough  just romantic enough and just satiric enough to be good there s nothing wrong with broad and campy humor  but america s sweethearts rarely gets the tone right the whole thing shambles when it should crackle the movie is a polished muddle  fitfully amusing but with no spine it s a perfectly fine setup for romantic comedy capering  with enough good one liners to satisfy  but roth seems a bit at sea with his powerhouse cast doesn t contain a single genuine emotion  it s just as bogus and hollow as the movie business it portrays director roth s only real nerve is in mocking excessive close ups in the walken  art  travesty  his own movie is a brazen  artless parade of them a film that manages the frustrating feat of being pleasant and misguided at the same time if you like a little surprise in your movies  don t bother lining up for america s sweethearts think of it as the spoonful of sugar that will help the medicine go down  a drizzle of soft ice cream guaranteed to bring a quick smile to a kid s face on a bad day occasionally amusing  but also an irritating mess as undemanding summer movies go  america s sweethearts is surprisingly funny and sweet  despite some missed comic opportunities and curious casting choices a hypocritical purveyor of the same schlock nonsense it pretends to lampoon for the farce it so desperately wants to be  the film often feels slack and too reliant on so so punch lines for laughs not quite tart  not real sweet can t decide if it wants to be a romantic comedy or a sarcastic send up of all things hollywood once the junket begins the film starts falling apart  parody and satire are replaced by tired  silly slapstick that is beneath the talents of the actors the movie is often chaotic and sometimes so silly and broad it borders on slapstick  but mostly it s just dumb fun you go to america s sweethearts anticipating a prime flossy  glossy entertainment  you come away better by a few laughs but with expectations sadly deflated a case study in missed opportunities given its subject matter  it s too genial to cut deep the script is full of half considered character stances all these good actors and all crystal s sass and witty candor can t bring back the heyday of billy wilder and preston sturges  or even  most of the time  their off days save for a few crackling wisecracks from billy crystal  and some moments of delicious is she  acting or  is it real insanity from catherine zeta jones  the fine cast sleepwalks through this film the film is longer on one liners than inventiveness  focus  and sharp characterization    it never rises above the level set by the routine  predictable screenplay   wide parched vistas of monotony separate scrabbly oases of amusement and the payoff for a gag almost never matches the time devoted to its setup not so much a terrible movie as a tryingly bland one  the star stuffed america s sweethearts actually manages to make entertainment tonight seem dangerous by comparison a fairly hilarious inside hollywood farce nothing overly special  new or particularly insightful about off screen romance in hollywood  but above average for what it s attempting to do and be the movie has no sparkle  no charm  nothing to sweep us off our feet a purely forgettable romantic comedy a terrific romantic comedy about narcissism  insincerity  lunacy and glamour like a bottle of lukewarm champagne    an expensive one  judging by the label    america s sweethearts opens with a promising burst of effervescence and quickly goes flat often funny but not that engaging  crystal  nearly sinks the medium sized comedy boat they re all trying to occupy  still  it s funny enough and forgettable enough that you probably won t mind  especially when julia shows off her teeth  t he jokes mostly fell flat the flick s got enough charming moments to offer a sweet  if not great  time it has the misfortune of being both too inside for outsiders and too unlikely for those in the know for a film that attempts to be a breezy farce  it s a remarkably sour affair with a thinly veiled contempt and self hatred for just about everything associated with hollywood these days you go away reasonably satisfied   not filled up  not delighted  but pleased that your expectations have been met again a slam dunk for julia roberts it reminded me of a stand up comedian who s not sure where his next joke is coming from imperfect but entertaining  this self deprecating film flirts with the public s perception of the hollywood machine  and flirts are fun a mildly amusing mess america s sweethearts would have been greatly helped by some rat a tat banter  but instead you get blather  and plenty of it it s dull  two dimensional  and totally toothless enormously engaging in its opening segments  it s unable to sustain that good feeling over the long haul while there are some laughs  this thing misses the mark too many times opens with terrific promise  reaches a few dead ends but usually redeems itself surprisingly little of the film rings true  as the stock comic situations pile up so quickly that its insider credibility is undermined do you wonder how this movie will turn out  as with most romantic comedies  the joy is in the journey when sweethearts runs out of sharp gags or crafty in jokes  it leans too heavily on misplaced  cartoonish slapstick disappointingly pedestrian for a movie with such ripe and easy targets for much sharper satire the ultimate irony is that a film that preaches about the promotion of a dud is itself a dud i can t recall the last time i ve seen this many supremely talented actors frittered away in such a slight romantic comedy it s entertaining and funny enough  but like your average quote whore  shows you what you d like to see  even if it s not entirely what is deserved a billy crystal shtick fest masquerading as romantic comedy  though it s hardly ever romantic and only occasionally funny hollywood may be the dream factory  but this probably isn t the dream the filmmakers had in mind as romance  america s sweethearts is as heartfelt as a sitcom  as hollywood satire  it s as pointed as an issue of mad an enjoyable night out pleasant old school comedy with a few modern  edgy twists one of the most caustic and hilarious looks behind the scenes of movie making since bowfinger a miasma of vanity envelops america s sweethearts where wit ought to reign yawnsville a deft  old fashioned combination of jokes and sentiment  the cinematic equivalent of one of crystal s opening monologues at the academy awards america s sweethearts begins as a smartly promising  gently farcical comedy of manners and ends as sourly and haphazardly as the lives it is poking fun at has its share of memorable funny moments  why would i want any of these jerks to be happy trite  unfunny  boring and a waste of everyone s talent leaves you shaking your head over a lost opportunity to make a really great comedy creative and extremely fun to watch nannannannannannannannannannannannannannana lot of the themes and language in the movie haven t aged well   the soundtrack is amazing  though to be admired rather than enjoyed  but a considerable achievement nonetheless outside the rap slams  either the acting or the persona is a bit joyless  the best review i can give a drama or an actor  when the film ends you still believe the character lives on while not exactly wow  eminem is solid and credible in a role which could so easily have screeched like chalk across a wet blackboard a refreshing way to build a story that is ghoulishly overfamiliar in nearly all its particulars it s easy to like jimmy smith as well as to admire him  because mr  mathers lets us in  with no sign of calculation  on the kindness  even tenderness  that jimmy conceals from most of the people around him what saves all this from being purely conventional is the filmmaker s keen sense of rabbit s essential solitude as an artist  even when surrounded by friends director curtis hanson puts a new spin on the familiar  triumph against the odds  theme with this slick showcase for the talents of superstar rapper eminem it ain t eminem  the movie but it does showcase eminem  the actor    easily the best rapper cum thesp since tupac shakur despite the predictable formula  screenwriter scott silver wisely avoids taking the easy route every time  there are several small twists you may not expect  and the ending isn t entirely a happy one because it rejects easy victories  this may be one of the few inspirational movies that could actually inspire someone  somewhere  sometime the movie has some of the braggadocio of its white trash hero  building to its competitive climax as if it were a gladiatorial sporting event  and it carried me all the way while no masterpiece  it is infinitely superior to the sad movie debuts of britney spears and mariah carey another fine effort from a director currently on a critical roll  hanson is great at teasing the audience with little samples of his star s lyrical dexterity as he builds towards the finale eminem s edgy  graphic quasi biopic is not for kids i was able to guess what would happen to most of the characters most of the time and come through perfectly     rocky with a rap beat     you can t stop him or crop him he s in widescreen and large he ain t playing when he s baggin  curtis hanson for sarge     blu ray ends on a high note  but it doesn t negate the tedium of the number of false and mostly flat ones that precede it eminem is quietly effective without ever displaying much emotion  it s a commendable film debut and he never falls into the vanity trap that many artists find when transferring their talents from the music stage to the screen the film is really no more than a two hour prelude to a climax in which our hero     rhythmically tells people off it is more just a pleasure to watch eminem perform  he is fiercely talented and has a natural charisma  the camera loves him  but  like most of the story  we knew that before we saw the film  a hesitant presence whose vulnerability pulls you in  eminem emerges as a mainstream movie star and effectively lays to rest the spooks of slim shady  impressionable parents will love this eminently responsible film the movie doesn t feel authentic and i think it s because of all the white folks involved like his wizardly lyrics  eminem s performance and his film have unexpected depth eminem does a credible roughed up urban ghetto impression of james deanhanson s enthusiastic participation in the project is bewildering given how pedestrian the story is  poor  white kid keeps getting beaten down before a final showdown   this eminem melts in your hand and not in your mouth following l a  confidential and wonder boys  this makes a remarkable hat trick for hanson and is a personal triumph for eminem better than average rags to riches story  but expect to get pinched for a special edition dvd later una buena pelcula  un ms que digno debut actoral para una estrella de rap  y una estupenda banda sonora  nada mal  eh if not strictly autobiography  the movie is close enough to eminem s story that he knows how this character feels  if this turns out to be the only role he ever plays    which i doubt    he can be happy that he played it to the limit despite the weak story  hanson commands a strong performance from eminem and showcases both the rapper s newfound acting abilities and his musical talent director hanson skillfully creates the oppressive nature of urban poverty with the dirt  grit  and darkness that remains prevalent throughout   there are brawls enough to provide the flavor of how life in the darker reaches of motown can be eminem summons things from deep inside himself to shed away ego and portray a calm  frustrated  worried kid who doesn t even talk too much the problem is eminem himself  who has clearly been drilled by the director to play to what will have to pass as strengths  stillness  cool  control it s a movie that showcases director curtis hanson working at the very height of his craft  but only to break even who could have predicted that a rap movie starring eminem would  at its best  be one of the year s sweetest joyrides what screamed a ridiculous idea or vanity project when you first read or head about it is the exact opposite   a well thought out and realised film which never thinks too much of itself eminem s skill still lies in turning an inventive phrase  filled with characters who lack depth  his film debut falls victim to its own modesty and is often insubstantial and boring eminem is such a commanding visual presence  diversely eloquent of patience  ire  and weariness  that his silent poses and solitary interludes become many of the film s most effective scenes everything that happens feels inevitable  achingly obvious    the abuse  the betrayals  the arguments  the reconciliations  the tiny defeats  the bigger victories the script is uninspired  the picture s characters are stick figures  its dialogue is lackluster and the star s performance seldom rises above the adequate there s no power fantasies here  no ego trips or fairy tale stories about a loser made good  in this case  the persona serves the story  not the other way around the story is all right  the picture s real excellence is its portrait of the society in which it takes place a solidly built  rather old fashioned yarn about a plucky underdog who triumphs in the face of adversity eminem manages to take all that we think we know about eminem and inject it into his character without turning the character into a simple screen version of himself extremely enjoyable film  with a winning performance from eminem    essentially this is the hip hop version of rocky  in a good way that the final rap battle feels so electrifying rather than merely coming across as the usual rah rah climax taps directly into the energy emanating from eminem as he gives his character a real presence not since rocky brought silvester stallone to virtually instant stardom has there been a more effective attempt to repeat the phenomenon eminem gives a focused  intelligent performance eminem proves himself on the big screen with this extremely well made film loosely based on his own life in innercity detroit the unique format of the motion picture shows how valuable it can be  for what else can be used to so vividly capture the most important element in a story like this    its cultural setting it s disappointing  sort of like if madonna had released her  sex  book without the sex even  eminem s  most devoted admirers likely will be surprised by his ability to keenly render and compellingly sustain a character throughout a feature length film if this movie had been directed by someone other than curtis hanson  i m talking some nobody shmoe or some flashy music video director  critics would have dismissed this as just another singer turned actor star vehicle with no more depth than a shot glassem s lowdown  dirty diatribe may sound like treason  but you might discover that his rhyme is the reason first adam sandler s in an art film  now eminem s in a  sports  movie   go figure however you view it  it s a story that s been told before  and yet  it works a decent  american  inspirational  rocky esque story if eminem is a genius then tiny tim must be god a powerful film that shows us the frustration and desperation of an entire emotionally neglected sub class  its bravura  rap battles  offering up the strongest prima facie connection between hip hop s chest thumping and adolescence s shoe gazing eminem plays a guy named  rabbit   and he doesn t get any respect  maybe going by the name  rabbit  isn t the route to respect  yo then there are the rap sequences where eminem displays an energy close to unrivaled by any performance this year  in these scenes  he and the film show what they re really made of we ve seen these character types before  but through the lens of curtis hanson  we suffer  carouse and dream right along with them a brilliant  engaging examination of people who dream of escape if the part is not much of a mental or emotional stretch for him   eminem  acquits himself well enough for me to want to see him in other films can eminem act  yes  i am happy to report rabbit s story is galvanizing and eminem is a superstar  but hiphop has more and other stories to tell who wastes time watching tiger woods when real action comes from the boyz in the hoods there is a quietude to the film  even though it is punctuated by a lot of music and even more yelling  its mood is soft and even humble a movie that will capture the attention of anyone who remembers what it was like when music was a crucial component of their daily existence certainly the best first film ever by a musician crossing over to the acting world so paper thin that the former  king of controversy  was able to cram the entire plot into one little crossover rap song that s currently playing at a radio station near you packs as much humor  hard truth and vitality as the rapper s lps a by the numbers storyline  complete with character actions that don t make a lick of sense because of how underdeveloped they are  eminem  does a lot of things right  so does the movie the payoff comes after an hour and a half of a long  criminally tiresome setup eminem steals the picture from a cast with snap down to the smallest parts what s most disappointing is the thoroughly cliched story underwhelming both in film and music  he tantalizes us with autobiographical detail while dazzling us with wit  grit  insight  profane humor and mind boggling wordplay the triumph here is that hanson and screenwriter scott silver have found a fresh way to tell this story funny  well acted and surprisingly engaging is eminem a movie star  only when he raps the film is emotionally charged  almost naturally so  with hanson s direction stressing the pop rapture that music can provide in a world that s dirty and ugly eminem delivers a performance of considerable passion and depth essentially a downtrodden teen  makes good film     that s not a bad thing  but it s nothing to rap home about  either merely a solid  conventional drama  because it ultimately loses sight of one very important fact  eminem is at his best when he s making people angry  not when he s asking for their sympathy it s raw  it s intense and it s very engrossing  eminem  goes the mile demanded of him and he emerges a certified winner this time out while it s doubtful that eminem could run out and perform shakespeare tomorrow  his talents on screen    in this role    are astounding uneven but watchable rapper eminem s film debut is far better than you d think    and a pure demonstration of the power of charisma after just a few years in the spotlight  eminem has accomplished something elvis  madonna  michael and mariah have not  he s made a great movie is it worth a look  sure  is it begging to be parodied  without a doubt   somebody alert the wayans say what you want about eminem  but the guy has passion and a gift with words   the finale at the battle simply rocks the house elegant and tough  unpretentiously directed by curtis hanson  it doesn t for a second pander to what is supposed to be the star s target audience eminem wipes away his hubris  revealing a trembling  self doubting kid on the way up  nothing  more than an elvis film  except there s a lot more sex and violence than blue hawaii and the music video sequences feature creative profanity instead of surfboards all this hoopla about eminem s so great  is it any more of a stretch than prince in  purple rain  or babs in  a star is born  or woody in any movie where he s having an affair with a younger woman the movie is a success on its own terms because the director doesn t condescend to pop music a fascinating  surprisingly entertaining stand off that has adroitly managed to satisfy both of its constituencies  allowing all sides to legitimately claim victory what saves all this from being purely conventional is the filmmaker s keen sense of rabbit s essential solitude as an artist  even when surrounded by friends what s pretty amazing here is that hanson has managed to take scott silver s lameass script and mediocre acting and turn it into something special backed by a smart story that avoids easy answers and pat endings  the rapper may be in line for some real acting recognition you have to question the time and care you want to invest in a character whose goal is to excel at insultsthe way this movie is made  the way this story is told  this is what is meant by the phrase  keepin  it real middle aged folks may not be attracted to the film s rap base but the built in youth demographic will love it basically recycles all the old  tired cliches that abound in every story about the rise to stardom of poor but talented youngsters who overcome terrible obstacles in their drive to succeed this movie is all about the dingy glamour of self pitying rage wounded and enigmatic  eminem is a worthy focus eminem is magnetic playing a version of himself eminem proves capable of carrying the lead  at least when the material is tailored to fit  rather than show great range in his first outing  he gives an effective slow burn qualifies as a cinematic event by tapping into the roots of eminem and the fury and feeling that inform his rap o k   so i m the wrong audience for this teenage junk gritty and electrifying a movie that will satisfy hip hop and eminem fans in ways they never expected  even more significantly  it will touch people who thought they hated hip hop and or eminem in ways they would have never expected tony manero  rocky balboa  eminem  it s a dazzling debut and an important movie the dialogue sometimes gets so silly and redundant when trying to push bunny rabbit s talent that i expected to see waterboy s rob schneider pop out and shout  you can do it eminem  eminem kept his cool  and his new movie was straight dope effective  if not more than a little dishonest  think blue crush with swear words as a vanity project  the film is more tolerable than purple rain but it s every bit as obvious and redundant eminem s performance as the struggling actor is very impressive a canny  and largely successful  attempt to broaden the star s appeal writer scott silver and director curtis hanson dig deep into the subculture to deliver a terrific movie i would imagine most of the exaggerated praise mile has received is in direct correlation to the stupid pictures most rap rock pop stars have made in vain attempts to become movie stars nannannannannancomic action  appealing hero  splendid dogs  some scares horrible acting  horrible script  and horrible direction plague this fiasco of a movie snow dogs  doesn t offer much  but to be fair  it had the youngest viewers at my screening cheering and laughing until the end whoever let the dogs out should probably consider a career change    as fleeting and insubstantial as a snowflake  and about as much fun while kids will probably eat the whole thing up  most adults will be way ahead of the plot what faustian bargain did gooding make  forcing him to star in this insipid fish out of water comedy that paints him as a bolton fan this is a family film like they used to make  where the humour balances the drama  the personal tragedies are life lessons and the animals are so darn cute  by golly the iditarod lasts for days   this just felt like it did a movie full of gestures that would look over the top in primary school plays gooding is so pleasant and likable  it s hard to get mad at him for wasting our time    this isn t even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism  it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels for some reason  disney keeps making really  really crappy live action films there s not much to like or dislike in this ride  it s the kind of all season  live action amusement that the disney studio has been churning out for decades if i told you that your children deserved this movie  you d slap my face large doses of slapstick humor and gooding s vitality keep snow dogs from slipping into dull  family entertainment  releasing a film with the word  dog  in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults  and snow dogs deserves every single one of them slapstick stunts  silliness  and shallow sentiment  with little else to satisfy moviegoers who want more than cuba gooding jr  falling down and mugging for the camera this may be the worst movie to star two oscar winners since the heyday of the studios when actors had no say in their projects it s all very cute  though not terribly funny if you re more than six years old pre packaged dog crap  a dumb movie made by dull witted adults who clearly believe that just because some viewers currently reside at the lower end of the age spectrum  they don t deserve better if the restless children in the movie theatre are any indication  the movie is just as uninteresting for them as it is tiresome for the adults two oscar winners are no match for irresistible dogs in this so so slapstick comedy instantly forgettable phoned in business as usual if you have a soft spot for man s best friend  it s a pretty good throwaway movie this silly youth targeted comedy goes strictly by the book  which should give you a clue as to its quality sure to test the patience of even those adults who will appreciate it simply for being an innocuous enough film that most of the family can see together there s little to recommend snow dogs  unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity the picture may be light as five inches of new powder  but it s still good for a family romp a film with almost as many delights for adults as there are for children and dog lovers every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are    no real plot  no real conflict  no real point gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance a movie set in the frozen north that just idles  endlessly  in the sitcom hothouse where convention slowly but surely becomes moldy cliche show me the mugging when in doubt  the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack  throws in a fish out of water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip  or else a doggie winks manages to please its intended audience    children    without placing their parents in a coma like state cuba gooding jr  valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs  but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy a ripoff of northern exposure the corny jokes and the tired plot will make any self respecting adult grimace amiable and full of good cheer   gooding  warms this cold weather comedy like shave ice without the topping  this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless perhaps the movie is working with the theory that if you do a schtick a million times  it eventually becomes funny  in this case  it really doesn t with its unimaginative slapstick sequences  gooding s toothy mugging and an unforgivable plug for michael bolton  snow dogs is adrift snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than himthis amiable  old fashioned family film is     a straightforward fish out of water tale with lessons for the little ones and a surprisingly earnest and moving performance from james coburn forget the dogs  who let this movie out it s playful  corny  silly  adventuresome and enjoyable disney s latest update of the lame live action b comedies that have been among the studio s more dubious contributions to american pop culture director brian levant  who never strays far from his sitcom roots  skates blithely from one implausible situation to another  pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you ll find on a french poodle its aims are modest    to make kids laugh as cuba gooding falls down a lot and to show how thrilling sled dogs are    and it achieves them this is a fine example of old fashioned disney movie making magic at its best poor cuba gooding  as if it were not humiliating enough to play a guy so clumsy that he can t walk in the snow without pratfalling  he also has to do jokes about being a black man in the great white north all actors anxiously awaiting oscar nominations in hopes of a career boost should go to snow dogs and gaze upon cuba gooding jr gooding and coburn are both oscar winners  a fact which  as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs  seems inconceivable if you ve never read the book  snow dogs may simply be a stupid waste of your time  but if you know the source  it s an abomination a mongrel of a movie  scruffy  obvious and slightly disreputable   the best one can say of it is that it could have been worse the movie just doesn t take any of its situations far enough  resulting in let down after let down the huskies are beautiful  the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent a hodge podge of buffoonery and bad animal jokes the late jim varney would turn his nose up at this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience    just pure slapstick with lots of inane  inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions adults  other than the parents   will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild the type of broad  fish out of water comedy where each crossed signal is telegraphed a mile away and the lead character falls down a lotjanuary is the month when the studios like to dump their dogs  and this film is a real mutt as distressed as a comedy can be without qualifying as a snow emergency frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances   keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease a fast paced comedic race through the wilds of alaska  cuba gooding jr  and the dogs provide solid entertainment for the whole family despite the usual pratfalls  a cute snow job gooding is the energetic frontman  and it s hard to resist his enthusiasm  even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences nannannannannannanthe narrative is clunking and lazy  there to get characters from a to b without any respect for coherence or us  the audience  i like the actors  but the movie did them no justice a tyler perry movie for white folks  couples retreat is a lazy  unimaginative comedy that  with the talent on show  should have been a whole lot more than another boring rom com to throw on the pile    an utterly incompetent comedic affair   a bit of a guilty pleasure  but  most of the humor falls flat  interesting that it s a vince vaughn vehicle that doesn t give vaughn enough to do  paul chambers  cnn full review at movies for the massesinstead of being a sharp  witty comedy about married couples experiencing vacation therapy together  it s more of a pinheads in paradise routine with only a few funny lines it s some kind of trick when a film can make jason bateman look unsubtle somewhere in all of this  there is the potential for a pretty good comedy  but this movie isn t it couples is so formulaic  so fake and relentlessly bland  it s hard to care if any of these pairings get a divorce  drown or are eaten by sharks  it has neither the ring of truth nor the fun of fantasy jon favreau and vince vaughn  wrote the witless script  so have only themselves to blame the debutant director is done no favours by a screenplay from vince vaughn and jon favreau which gives him little to play with and them few chances to shine as actors a patchwork collection of derivative gags and relationship drama that seems leftover from old  thirtysomething  episodes retreat as quickly as possible for all its visual splendor  to say nothing of its likable cast  the movie never feels as liberating as its locale why couldn t couples retreat have been lighthearted and zany throughout  instead of trying to push across a message about picket fence monogamy couples retreat comes across as a movie that was made    because it was felt that if the right buttons were pushed  this might make money that the wonderful french actor jean reno plays the therapist is a sign that his agent is not doing a good enough job finding him film roles in american movies this couples in conflict comedy starts strongly but then slips into the turquoise water of paradise lost bora bora was a beautiful location to film at and added that much needed taste of paradise to a rather bitter sweet subject of a troubled marriage a rom com short on romance and even shorter on laughs expectations of farce are stymied by long stretches of mid life navel gazing rather like an unsuitable partner  couples retreat starts out fun before gradually getting annoying and then becoming downright aggravating  while it s not the worst film ever  there are times when it feels as irritating as sunburn it is this vanity  this overweening self regard  that makes couples retreat such a chore to sit through a loo book written by pol pot would have more laughs than this chillingly unfunny  cynically prefabricated non comedy the only thing that will keep your attention for the duration is the stunning tahitian scenery that acts the films setting  on reflection this is probably what swayed most of the cast to sign up to this inane guff of a film in the first place entertainment on a par with sitting through your neighbours  holiday slideshow universal s latest is merely adequate  and will likely be best enjoyed by the happily indulgent and mildly inebriated about as much fun as having a holiday ruined by bickering  self involved couples  this is one romcom you really should retreat from a trip to the innermost circle of comedy hell a comedy deserving to be buried up to its head in sand  drizzled in cooking oil and then left to fry until crispy fewer laughs than the average episode of itv s benidorm sadly for us though  favreau and vaughn are likely to continue their profitable relationship for some time to come if it were a send up of couples therapy and its absurd language the film would at least be about something  but it hasn t even that much intelligence vaughn manages to grab more screen time to showcase his charisma but do we really need to watch his midlife crisis unfold over the course of nearly two hours the script for this comedy is so half baked that we begin to wonder why it was made at all  not only is it resolutely unfunny  but it never dips beneath a superficial examination of relationship cliches    truly dismal   this is a movie to avoid floundering  only intermittently funny  wait for the dvd hugely disappointing  painfully unfunny comedy that completely wastes its talented cast and then compounds the misery with a dismal script couples  retreat  this movie has the power to make any date feel as endless and soul sucking as the lifetime s worth of defective  hateful marriages that doom the film s protagonists it s too easy to say that peter billingsley shot his eye out with this inept comic trifle  but   well  he shot his eye out the actresses are so wasted  they re even demoted to fifth  sixth  seventh and eighth billing under every one of the dudes  at least the guys aren t having fun either good for some laughs and some likable characters  vaughn and favreau stand out while bateman fades into the backgrounda tyler perry movie for the rest of america  without so much melodramaa bit like getting relationship advice from a clown  a really  really unfunny one although it has its moments  couples retreat isn t so much a movie but rather a giant excuse for some real life bffs to hang out in south pacific tawdry and tedious   couples retreat  is a retread of the almost equally unfunny  license to wed  mandatory marriage counseling ruins vacation in battle of the sexes sitcom with couple s retreat  we re hoping for a wedding crashers redux we can turn into a date night  but all we get is something else to bitch about i feel no pity for vince vaughn and jon favreau who co wrote the piece  for their co stars   we hope this career killer is worth the paycheck the secret to a happy marriage involves falling in love over and over again with the same person   couples retreat  offers an amusing illustration of that old saying we have another durable candidate for a slew of razzie awards    vaughn plays the same persona in every movie  he has a blustery  cocksure swagger on the outside while hiding his deep seated insecurities the former swingers settle for standard gags in the moderately amusing couples retreatfor a great deal of its running time it is raw  uncompromising and very  very funny  and even when things hit a dry spell i was still moved and amused enough to not particularly care the twosome that sparks most agreeably is vince vaughn and jon favreau      the humor isn t always highbrow  but it works couples retreat is like watching somebody s boring vacation videos  except that they re filled with big stars this is one of those films  like last week s whip it and so many others of late  that looks like it was a lot fun to make  it s just not all that much fun to watch the  retreat  in the title is surely a warning to any potential ticket buyers couples retreat is a comedy drama mix  but it s mostly the comedy parts that work there are also scenes  the disjointed kind that wander off aimlessly in the vague hope of finding a movie  not to mention a laugh couples retreat is a comedy of exhaustion  but it is the comedy itself  in both concept and execution  that seems tired greatly silly and unexpectedly wise at times this deeply unfunny film is further proof that movie comedy these days    in its acting  writing  directing    is far below the average sitcom has nothing to offer but a lively ensemble cast and beautiful scenery while falling flat as a comedy that s painfully low on laughs and high on juvenile  asinine and uninspired attempts at humor during the shark attack       the sympathy was not necessarily with the humans in the waterat least vince vaughn  jon favreau and their fellow cast and crewmates were able to spend time on a gorgeous tropical island while making this mirthless  half hearted relationship comedy instead of capitalizing on some original issues  the tired standards are glossed over and solved  but not in a funny way all the marriage mending becomes really tiresome when all we want is some laughs a loud  crude  dreary misfire that feels like it was cobbled together from material cut from other lousy comedies the only way to look at couples retreat as a bookend to swingers is to note how far these two talented stars have fallen by the time it starts getting dramatic  i was rooting for each one of them to get a divorce the whole production just comes off as a paid vacation at club med for vaughn and friends a giant black hole in the center of the comedy universe sucking in the best ideas and situations from other entities into an inescapable ride to nothingness for those of us who were weened on the idea that we re all  money  and we don t even know it  couples retreat is a little difficult to see  but is it bad  not entirely  it s not entirely good either couples retreat is neither funny nor honest  the exact opposite of a retreat  it s merely exhausting beneath the ham acting and the relentless banter is a serious movie about relationships  we re being sold laughs  but a few sober thoughts are delivered it s too bad couples retreat is so poorly written and conceived  given the talented cast and chemistry between vaughn and pal favreau  we re meant to relate to these hapless folks or laugh at their foibles  but more often we wince earnest  not particularly funny  and ultimately unforgivably sentimental  somewhere along the way someone forgot humour vaughn  favreau and company phone it in   all the way from bora bora   in this lame relationship comedy the film maintains a sufficiently pleasant comic vibe as the couples bicker and pick away at each other  but director peter billingsley never really brings matters to a satisfying boil the cast s enthusiasm goes a long way toward keeping the whole mediocre affair from becoming completely intolerable this is what passes for middle of the road comedy these days  safe without being prudish  never too disturbing  never too funny couples retreat turns out to be a sloppy  choppy mess if an easy watch is what you re after this will do the trick  simply keep expectations at a modest level and it won t be a waste of time despite the potential for humour from the couples and their relationship problems  the script relies on lame situation jokes couples retreat is ridiculous and whorish  but the minds behind it are too sharp to simply leave it at that doesn t have either the guts or wherewithal to follow through with the humor and stick to its setup couples retreat is an unending parade of offensive scenes  a tedious cavalcade of miserable  shallow people with whom we are no doubt supposed to identify but with whom we should hope to see nothing in common vaughn favreau marriage comedy has lots of sex  drinking the end result  sad to say  is just about as entertaining as watching someone else s home movies for two solid hoursparental content reviewkinda stupid  kinda funny  it s the ultimate fall film it s not that the laughs aren t there  it s just that they re telegraphed what s depressing is that there s hardly a creative spark in this sour  offensive  contrived story  and its sloppiness is more consistent than its comedy offers nothing new to the tropical vacation comedy     not even the funniest bits from the commercials really stack up to much of the cast s weakest work to date a marriage renewal comedy with a decent cast  a few good ideas and no clear grasp on what to do with them enjoy the stunning south pacific views  but don t expect some enchanted evening the acting is a mixed bag  jon favreau and faizon love  who never hit a false note  are the standouts if you must  go for the scenery the various therapies    talk  yoga  massage    serve only to set up tired insult humor and smarmy sight gags trouble in paradise  that s the overly familiar premise of this sun poisoned comedy ever go on a vacation where most of the people around seem to be having more fun than you  then you already know what it ll feel like to visit couples retreat there s only one winner in this film  and it s applebee s  take my word for it and watch some travel channel instead the cast got to spend a month shooting on bora bora  so that explains why they re in the movie  why you d spend good money for a ticket to watch them have all the fun and not have any fun yourself passes understanding couples retreat is a pleasant  undemanding  middle of the road comedy  and really  were you expecting anything else billingsley does a good job on selling the beauty of the island  but only a serviceable one in telling this story  then again  there isn t all that much to tell we just keep wishing they would get out of the way and let us enjoy the pretty scenery imagine that you are listening in on the marriage counseling sessions of the dullest couple you know  multiply that by four  and you ve got a pretty good approximation of the experience of watching couples retreat    may be set in bora bora  but it s about as much fun as a lock down with an obsessive religious cult watching couples retreat cowriters favreau and vince vaughn play schlubby husbands is like showing up to your high school reunion to find that the once sharply dressed cool guys with the fake ids are now fat and bald  and married the only really funny moments in couples retreat are bits that were clearly ad libbed by the film s stars  vince vaughn and jon favreau yes  there s pointed human comedy to be mined from the very real stresses of married life  but this bonehead idiots in  paradise farce raises issues only to gloss them over it s hard to know if more convincing relationships would have made a difference in a movie so committed to funny accents and potty jokes  but at least it would have shown some effort after traveling to eden with the shallow  self involved  unpleasant twits that populate couples retreat  you ll be wishing they d all have packed their bags and gone straight to hell  instead might be funnier with several rum punches in hand it s one bland scene after another  played at medium pace with middling creativity  punctuated with a near desperate attempt at a laughcouples retreat leaves a good cast stranded without a script  although the cast isn t in much of a position to complain every time the performers insinuate some fresh response  the concepts close in on them  i began to dread even the funny bits  because i knew director peter billingsley would milk them to death before booking a ticket  i urge you to retreat a comedy without any identifiable humor  retreat is dreadful  but to consider just how many gifted performers are here treading water makes the heart sick  ralphie  how dare you predictable  but humorous couples  retreat though i enjoy nearly everyone on screen in couples retreat  i found it pretty meager and more than a little depressing couples retreat is essentially vaughn and favreau s baby  and it is absolutely  inexcusably terrible maybe it s pointless to complain about the shocking lack of elegance to an instantly forgettable bit of multiplex fluff like couples retreat  it s like complaining about the food at applebee s   on the surface   couples retreat  appears to be a quickly stitched together comedy that places a bunch of likable actors in a tropical setting for some cheap laughs  and that s exactly what it is the scenery makes you want to be somewhere other than a movie theater  and the movie has the same effect it contains little comedy  except for free standing one liners  and no suspense  except for the timing of the obligatory reconciliation  it doesn t even make you think you d like to visit its island paradise has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  and makes extra effort to insult its audience whenever possible a few funny lines and ideas emerge here and there  but couples retreat mostly feels repetitive and overlong at nearly two hours  you wouldn t mind getting voted off this island this intermittently funny tale of four couples undergoing relationship therapy struggles hard for its occasional laughs those involved got to spend weeks at a bora bora luxury resort  all we get is this not lousy but unmemorable tropical vacation comedy couples retreat plays like the nba all star game  what seems like a dream team exhibition of pros at the top of their game too often turns into an undisciplined mess couples  a sputtering if sporadically amusing misfire  packed a lot of actors off to a pretty location and gave them nothing funny or deep to do thanks to vaughn  favreau  and the stray sharp lines that pop out of everyone else  the film at least offers the lively sound of egos that still know how to swing if you feel like a date movie with a little romance  big laughs  witty dialogue  appealing characters and a spectacular location  this is not it     an  embarrassment and an insult to audiences who might be conned into thinking it s escapist fun mean  miserable married men  not funny  a toddler easily steals the movie nannannannannannannanwhat makes knocked up stand out is not just the fact that the jokes are side splittingly funny but that nearly everything that happens to the couple rings so true  the very fact that some clearly juvenile filmmakers have hit on the truth that a baby in the womb is as much a life as the one cradled in its mother s arms is encouraging what really sells it is a fantastic support cast featuring paul rudd  jason segel  kristen wiig  jonah hill and leslie mann     seth rogen and katherine heigl have great chemistry onscreen and they are hysterical together  apatow  makes responsibility and commitment funny  no mean feat what makes most of knocked up work is its ability to squeeze big laughs out of real world situations knocked up proves that hit comedy doesn t have to dumb down for its demographic with sparkling performances from rogen and heigl  apatow once again shows his sharp eye for talent and continuing knack for hits the jokes  which are in the absolute poorest taste  remain hilarious  while a newer  deeper humanism  sensed in momentary flashes in the earlier film  is now fully on display the movie is a decisive breakthrough for apatow  whose comic instincts go hand in hand with an unfashionable empathy it s a hysterical  well acted  and wonderful glimpse at impending parenthood from a man s perspective   it s a movie with heart and with balls  and it knows when to use each of them if apatow was seeking to make a film that s smutty and funny  but also romantic and realistic about relationships  he s succeeded admirably knocked up is possibly the best comedy of the year for all of its filthy tirades  knocked up is perhaps one of the more sentimental and honorable morality tales this year  featuring more educational value and entertainment than all of the after school specials in the world there are also surprisingly few subplots for a movie that lasts more than two hours  what is on display  however  is very fertile stuff apatow s cockeyed citizen kane  merging goofball  pothead jokes with a plausible story of unshakable relationship discomfort  a broad mismatch of personalities and body shapes glued together by the cruelty of insemination interesting blend of frat house smarm and emotional incisivenessthe film seethes with misdirected and unrecognized anger knocked up is like a hallmark greeting card with crude verse  it s is an uneasy mix of ethnic humor  slacker humor  and human drama    some is amusing  some is indulgent  and some is strained  a  very funny peter pan and wendy  get preggers story a pleasant enough comedy that doesn t take the  gross out  too far and presents a complex  if egotistical view of pregnancy and responsibility apatow simply knows funny when he sees it  and he gives his actors  ample opportunity to plumb all possible comic depths knocked up really comes alive when it has something to say about the thorny responsibilities    and unexpected blessings    of adult relationships for all its avowed interest in life    as in  you know  the biological imperatives of our existence    its characters seem acquainted only with television apatow s talent for accurately portraying his generation at their most self absorbed doesn t quite go as far at justifying the script s patchy  haphazard conflicts at it does toward explaining the film s bloated running time everything about it is greatthere is always something to smile about and identify with  if you re a slacker  condescending or extremely hormonal this film has someone for you to worship somehow  some way  apatow has crafted that rarest of gems    equal parts heart and crass knocked up is an instant classic  and cements apatow s status as the top comedic director in the businessstupidest and most overhyped piece of garbage since  little miss sunshineraunchy but tender comedy about sex and parenthood a fun  relevant  raunchy and often hilarious movie although this story about a mismatched couple expecting a baby strains credibility and sometimes pushes the limits of good taste  it delivers plenty of belly laughs i chuckled some  i smiled a lot the professionally ambitious alison and the unemployed slacker ben are the ultimate odd couple  both likable though unsuited in every way if judd apatow is going to set the gold standard for american screen comedy  it s only natural to start expecting more apatow s hardly the first filmmaker to go all gooshy on the subject of kids after becoming a father himself  but with his comic talent and flair for character  you d think his movie would be more insightful about impending parenthood it s hard to deny the fact that  all this considered  it s a work of art  even with that title now that he s tackled the topic of sex  apatow continues his exploration into the world of relationships with the next logical step    pregnancy    and in doing so  has created another cult classic maybe i m being a little harsh on this movie  because there are a couple of funny scenes here and there  but they are so outweighed by the ones that bored me silly  they re not the ones that i remember it s just too refreshing to see a well made  genuinely funny comedy that is actually about something meaningful ultimately it s a refreshing  amusing  and surprisingly touching comedy a mostly funny  occasionally charming  steadily foul mouthed  frequently well written  otherwise downright stupid comedy  enjoyable in spite of its unaccountably overblown length of over two hours finally  a breath of fresh air arrives in the stale summer of sequels given that i like everyone involved  it is puzzling to me that i did not enjoy it  but such is life you will recognize ben stone  in all his potheaded  work fearing glory  and the laugh of recognition is surely the purest of all laughs extremely funny  well written and sharply observed comedy with strong comic performances from its talented cast funny  rude and with a heart of gold that surprisingly doesn t grate this is a rare thing   a comedy for both him and her if the essence of great comedy is truth then knocked up falls some way short very funny for an hour  judd apatow s script and direction are finally mugged by a gang worse than any of these  the feelgood moralists  who terrorise all parts of tinseltown a satire on american infantilism   or an example of it  either way  it s funny knocked up really is the comedy of the year knocked up reinvents the romantic comedy for a new generation it s so funny that you ll be snorting popcorn out of your nose before the end the mix of emotionally rich humour and sheer bawdy pleasures makes knocked up one of the finest hollywood comedies for years  if you have someone special in your life  this just maybe the best date movie ever the year s best comedy  one that confirms the arrival of an extended group of talent that looks set to take the studio comedy crown from the likes of ferrell  stiller and carrey warm  funny  smart  the best rom com in a long time knocked up touches places most comedies wouldn t dare  some of them scarily biological  some of them scarily accurate  it s the sleeper hit of the summer  but don t worry  it s much better than that there s no doubt director writer apatow is supplying a national service by allowing the inept to feel adequate about themselves as with the best comedies  the film mines its laughs from recognizable human traits  its premise might sound like something some folks might dread  but as a movie  it s everything you could wish for has its moments  but not enough of them  and it ends up not saying much of anything a highly scathing jolt of relationship reality judd apatow s knocked up may have a provocative title  but just like a tv sitcom that placates an audience s apprehension about the real world  it neither titillates nor challenges the humor arises from the situations and the characters  not from an overeager screenwriter s determination to cram as many jokes and putdowns into the script as possible goodhearted and refreshingly messy knocked up isn t better because it is more realistic  but this approach lends the material an appropriately mature tone from the ridiculous to the profound  there are many truths in this smart comedy that takes flight from its talented cast for all the talk of  morals  in the american cultural dialogue  stoner ben says the only thing that really should matter   i just want to do right by you like many films of late  knocked up is a little too long  but it s worth it in the end  stone is so pathetic  we need extra time for apatow to convince us that alison shouldn t have an abortionit shows nine months what a great childbirth comedy can be we often feel like our hopes and dreams are over once a child enters the equation  but it s movies like this that help remind us it s only the beginning there is raunch aplenty  but none that doesn t serve a story that is sharp  smart and wrythere are some downsides  but you have enough laughs  so it s entertaining  i wouldn t throw the baby out with the bathwater  just go in knowing this is not the next classic romantic comedy a male fantasy of rescue from irrelevance   apatow loves his actors and the characters they play  and the improvisational spirit on his set keeps the comedy fresh and real i did not know what to expect going into this film  i was prepared for an offensive natured film  but i was very surprised  this film was clean and had taste knocked up  is one hilarious moment on top of another    apatow  sees love as something that can slip in the back door when the front door is barricaded by common sense the movie gets a lot of mileage from the boys  bonding over shared fears  frustrations  and yearnings it is hilarious  heartwarming and an absolute delight from beginning to end it is not easy to walk that tightrope between clever  witty  insightful humor and bawdy farce  but apatow seems to walk it with ease knocked up isn t going to help change the world or anything  but at the very least it may help take one s mind off the relentlessly dismal headlines  i don t know what greater service a mere movie can perform these days engagingly raunchy  but strip apatow s films of their vulgarity and they d warm the heart of a production code censor from a half century ago the film simply can t and doesn t live up to the lofty expectations created by its  virgin  predecessor brush aside the crude formula and bathroom humor and you ve got yourself a surprisingly delicate social commentary not only is it hysterically funny  but it s refreshing to see a movie about adults that s not dumbed down for kids knocked up is an ambient  funny movie more devoted to enjoying the journey of its characters  world than it is bothered with its destination an unlikely but likable comedy  bigger on sweetness than it is on belly laughs as observational satire  it lacks the outcast verve that comes with real outrage one of the best scenes in the film belongs to harold ramis as ben s dad  when ben goes to his father with concerns about his own impending fatherhood  the two share a lovely heart to heart with equal measures of raunch and sentimentality  knocked up explores the minefield of imminent parenthood for two people who don t know each other very well although i loved this movie  i m getting tired of the king of queens world where attractive  capable women fall in love with end up mothering shlubby  childish men it s all about pushing the envelope and scoring one for less attractive  socially awkward males its best and worst attribute is how nice it is apatow s ability to wring laughs both large and small out of ordinary situations is enviable a hilarious family values flick which manages to convince you that it s possible to transform a misogynist into a doting father on the guilt of an unplanned pregnancy run out and see this baby a refreshingly frank  funny odd couple comedy with engaging leads and too many belly laughs to count knocked up is a knockout     a genuine honesty and realism that lets r rated hilarity ensue from the truth instead of mere spectacle follows the standard crude romantic comedy formula  but it does so with remarkable intelligence  it s not just crude and funny  it s also perceptive and smart how can a movie be simultaneously profane and sweet     the bawdy humor always seems to be around to keep things in check this film is every man s wet dream  what woman wouldn t want to have a one night stand with a drunken  fat  vulgar  irresponsible  dirty looking slob knocked up depicts its central concept far more truthfully than we have any right to expect  a blessed event  yes  but also chaotic  scary  and supremely difficult hilarious from moment to moment  but leaving behind both a warm glow and a sting  this is a picture that refuses to fetishize either the ability to conceive or the significance of our place in the universe once we ve done so there s value in films about supernatural heroes and bigger than life villains  but the ones that stick with us feature characters we can relate to  apatow has given birth to that sort of film  and he should be a very proud papa what makes the movie so winning are its endearing and relatable characters who spout believable dialogue and amusing banter  steeped in clever pop culture references and sharp observations of human nature beginning at the end of the traditional meet court marry impregnate chain of romantic events  apatow s clever comedy is a romance in reverse  and it works knocked up is a different kind of movie  a refreshing mix of the whip smart and the heartfelt one of the raunchiest  dirtiest  most hilarious movies in recent memory and  hands down  the best american comedy of the year so far it s hard enough to find comedies like this at any time  so it s a small and welcome miracle to come upon one in the midst of a typical movie summer  richer than ever in over budgeted  underwhelming inanities apatow shows how a comedy should and can be more like life  without sacrificing a laugh it s what makes apatow s comedies so interesting  old fashioned notions of love and commitment  delivered with honesty and without too much sentiment  decorated with a contemporary taste for the vulgar apatow has a gift for earthy  snarky humor and for making heroes of the lamest of doofuses  his wit is sharp  his feel for a wide range of characters is deep  and his ability to coax random hilarity out of an improvising cast is precious and rare knocked up is a knockout apatow s dialogue is so good  the undercurrent of his story so inherently sweet  and the performances so engaging  that you surrender immediately something about its portrait of the battle between men and women rings familiar and true  and it has a sweetness and innocence that elevates the best of the genre  c elebrat es  as charming and inevitable and amusing and sweet what anyone who is that apparently rare specimen    an actual  genuine grownup    should be decrying as deplorable what ultimately makes the film so satisfying is the seriousness and affection with which apatow treats his characters  no matter how drug addled or misguided they may be i m not saying this is a john cassavetes film or anything  but the movie s ability to uncork one great line after another that evokes both a laugh and an uncomfortable feeling of recognition is masterful it s the sideways of the something about mary subgenre  a raunchy cartoon laughfest that takes its emotional issues dead seriously as he did with virgin  apatow here pulls off the not inconsiderable feat of making the crude seem somehow endearing  there s something in the apatow style that makes palatable material that in the hands of other directors would be tasteless already a hilarious filmmaker  judd apatow is maturing into an emotionally resonant storyteller while apatow s movie isn t perfect  it s still a fumbling and funny valentine to the shock of pregnancy  the reality of love and the chaos of all that comes after look at what else is playing in multiplexes across north america at the moment and  if you can find a film that entertains and touches as effectively  give us a call knocked up is full of huge laughs and witty pop culture banter but also offers insightful and honest explorations of marriage  relationships  friendship and parenthood even if it goes on past full term  it never seems like labor  more like a big bungle of joy it s a very simple movie that ends up making room for some invitingly complex ideas knocked up is half goofball guy movie and half sentimental chick flick  and it works on both levels  even if it does overstay its welcome  helmer  apatow and company s latest endeavor has a lot going for it  including heart and intelligence blisteringly hilarious from start to finish  a relationship comedy built on sturdy emotional conflict and not a series of flimsy gags here is a movie loaded with raunchy jokes about premarital sex and getting stoned that is not just soda out the nose funny but also one of the most life affirming and pro marriage movies ever made knocked up has a really surprising sweetness to it amidst some truly raunchy jokes knocked up  has an elegance of form  a generosity of spirit and a mad determination to take things too far   and then farther  that approaches comic perfection  and in the end achieves it takes a worn out plot and give it a surprisingly warm and fuzzy  yet very r rated face lift the situations are so painful sometimes that its almost as if apatow sat down and made a list of the things that create friction between men and women and then wrote a script around that a sex comedy with a large heart and a generous spirit  judd apatow s knocked up is a thrilling piece of work   a character driven story rooted in adult reality that s the funniest film since  uh  what  maybe     ever    suffers from an aimless  overlong sort of vibe that often threatens to negate its many positive attributes    the latest movie in one of the odder hybrid genres  the cross between the romantic comedy and the gross out fratboy farce  apatow  dampens any impending slapstick with his brilliant  deceptively ragged dialogue  the situations live and breathe via his finely tuned talk judd apatow is making comedies but also wants to tell relationship stories and get more serious at times  for better or worse  apatow  makes these basic situations as humane and as funny as you d expect  and he makes it look effortless a very lovable and witty comedy that should be a welcome friend in this sequel heavy summer marks a more mature worldview and understanding of relationships from  apatow s  last film you can t go wrong with knocked up if you just want to laugh  and feel a bit dirty about it later not only does the film treat its characters with respect and without condescension  it does so even when their actions border on the indefensible it may be a bit  um  premature to say so  but judd apatow s knocked up strikes me as an instant classic  a comedy that captures the sexual confusion and moral ambivalence of our moment either an act of subversive genius or a strangely conservative scolding in the guise of a dumb comedy apatow knows growing up is a rough patch of grass but he wants to understand it  such lofty ambitions seem to have been largely banished from romantic comedies  but here  it gives knocked up an honest timelessness an attitude bazooka full of sex  drugs and raw language  yet so high on babies and family values that this must be the first r rated film for both sleazoid slackers and earnest right to lifers apatow has an original wit and golden touch that seems to cry out for more sophisticated material  it will be very interesting to see what he does with the free rein that the enormous box office success of this movie is likely to bring him it s not that knocked up is misogynistic    if anything  apatow is uxorious to a fault  scrupulously respectful of chicks and the chick stuff they do  he just doesn t seem to get exactly what that stuff is apatow s marriage of guyville and girlworld is not one made in heaven    he s too pragmatic to observe the rom com conventions  what s potent about knocked up is its down to earthiness apatow s gleefully raunchy movies are  in an odd and charming way  extremely family friendly i doubt you ll see a funnier movie this summer than knocked up  apatow has clearly earned the unusual mantle of chief chronicler of modern family life in all its profane glory even if you haven t been in this exact situation  if you ever did  this judd apatow fella would totally know what it s like sweep aside the gross outs and you ve got the family values comedy of the year funny  honest  and generous  this is mainstream american comedy at its best apatow s awfully sharp as a chronicler of contemporary romantic anxieties with his latest  writer director judd apatow proves he has a very unique talent   he can create a male arrested adolescent gross out comedy while playing to and understanding the emotions of women the late  great rodney dangerfield used to say that the best part about babies is making them  knocked up proves that the nine month ride can also be pretty damn fun  too while seth rogen s no steve carell  he s perfect for knocked up  both the star and the movie are flabby  immature and almost always funny if you want to hate on judd apatow s knocked up    and the anti crowd pleaser contingent will surely ding it    then get ready to be drowned out by the sound of laughter from the rest of us unlike so many comedies that rely on plastic characters based on no one from this universe  apatow studies society and what truly makes us laugh    which often turns out to be ourselves knocked up has more heart than any of the hollywood blockbusters released so far this year     combined knocked up is so enamored of ben and his insouciant charm that it fails to wonder what it must feel like for the girl knocked up is a good film  lurking beneath the surface is a great one just dying to break free knocked up never stops being funny  but after a while it eases into a profound commentary about commitment  sacrifice and the life changing results of one fleeting mistake grownups  your summer smash has arrived apatow   makes the nicest movies to have ever been rated r two hours and small change seems like a lot for any movie comedy to ask of its audience  but it s hard to imagine how much knocked up could shed from its baggy frame without diminishing its roughhousing charms those of us whose diet includes two dozen romantic comedies a year may find apatow s crass good nature appealing  knocked up has something to shock almost everyone but something to make almost everyone smile  too more than just laugh out loud funny  it s the relationship comedy of the summer and likely the best boy meets girl movie of the year an uproariously frank treatment of pregnancy and adulthood  movies about family chaos are generally the province of pg rated steve martin comedies  which makes the raw candor of apatow s film not only refreshing  but more honest in its sentiment like most of apatow s work  knocked up walks a perilous line between sarcasm and sentimentality  and though it s extremely funny in bursts  the movie flirts once too often with schmaltz before toppling into melodrama in its third act good as a nutty anthropology of marginal living and as an illustration of how much energy it takes to do nothing in a work obsessed society finds humor and pathos in sex  friendship  relationships and the relentless process of growing up has some sporadic laughs  but ben and especially his roommates are just too gross to be the kind of charming free spirits apatow thinks they are judd apatow makes me want to be a dude a film that manages to be uncommonly thoughtful and sensitive to the complexity of its very faulted characters while still being relentlessly  brilliantly funny uproarious  while keeping your funny bone occupied  quietly reaches for your heart bone  yes  it s coarse  okay  vulgar  and crude  alas  the title doesn t promise you tact you don t need a telescope to spot a new star  check out the blisteringly funny relationship film  knocked up  and you ll leave the theaters certain that seth rogen is movie comedy s next big thing it s a near perfect mix of juvenility and intelligence  and of coarseness and sweetness once heigl sells us on why she might not outrightly reject the man of her nightmares and delineates a character who might take a sort of let s see approach  we detect the charm of her interpretation and the possibilities of the premise knocked up is comic chicken soup for the colbert nation soul apatow s part in the rehab of the mainstream comedy relies on the underlying yearnings of archetypal social strivers the likelihood of  director judd  apatow turning into chris columbus or ron howard seems refreshingly slight except for being a bit on the long side    which you won t mind because you ll be having too much fun    it s pretty close to perfect judd apatow is making the freshest  most honest mainstream comedies in hollywood apatow is clearly a romantic  even if there s a profane edge to his  love conquers all  worldview  other filmmakers embarking into the comedy minefield could learn a thing or two from him  he s two for two lewd  crude and straight from the heart   it s a sincere meditation on adulthood  accountability  and fidelity    and  yeah  getting high a winning combination of wit  physical humor and bawdy sight gags knocked up feels very now  the banter is bruisingly funny  the characters brilliantly childish  the portrait of our culture s narrowing gap between children and their elders hysterical    in all senses because its central character is a meticulously architected dude  knocked up is a contrived male fantasy dabbles in the improbable loony male driven fantasy of flabby slacker sex appeal  while taking pot shots at the snobbery of upwardly mobile gorgeous women who wouldn t give them a second look in actual life judd apatow s raunchy and realistic look at sex  marriage and responsible parenting is one of the most consistently funny movies of the year relatability is certainly a key component of knocked up s inherent appeal a mega laugh comedy about the messiness of change with lovable characters whose humor and flawed humanity make them very appealing you expect it to be crude  rude  profane and hilariously vulgar   and it doesn t disappoint though some  including the filmmakers  might find this sort of material smart and real  others might consider it middlebrow and not particularly representative of the complex and interesting people they know  some of whom are even men what do i already know after just one screening  that this belongs on the short list of the best comedies of the last twenty years filled with real characters  great pop culture references  foul mouthed jokes and with a gooey sweetness right at the center  knocked up is a comedy classic i wondered why there aren t more films    especially comedies    this sharp  this clever  this good it s not just about growing up  it s the kind of movie that helps you grow up knocked up is uproarious  line for line  minute to minute  writer director judd apatow s latest effort is more explosively funny  more frequently  than nearly any other major studio release in recent memory nanits plump chickens maintain that strange  haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them even without wallace and gromit  most of the trademark joys are here  the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery  the wide  open ended rictus of a toothy smile  and the great parkian gulp it coaxes you to laugh and cry  flatters your intelligence  and practically guarantees a cheap night out  at dinner afterward  no one s going to be ordering anything but salad it s a warm hearted and amusing entertainment that your children will enjoy chickens are inherently funny  like nature s idea of a very practical joke  park and lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag  making it movable  turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans chicken run is a charmingly conceived entertainment  but it s a little bit twee what gives this movie its oddly strong grip on a viewer s heart is a physical tenderness inseparable from the nature of claymation the claymation comedy chicken run is eggsactly what the doctor ordered  it s a witty  high spirited adventure that will appeal to moviegoers of all ages  call it chicken soup for the funny bone  the first feature film from england s aardman animation  and the first truly terrific film to be released by dreamworks most of the time chicken run entertains  instructs  involves and enchants run to chicken run  this clay animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since babe the film is brilliantly voiced across the board  with special notice to mel gibson as rocky and julia sawalha as ginger the sly  sardonic flight of fancy known as chicken run is a delightful epic of fowl deeds  quests for freedom and poultry heroics from the off kilter english cartoon house  aardman animation indeed  it s the best movie comedy to come out of england since monty python packed up the circus chicken run contains some gorgeous  destined to be classic set pieces  and this is where the aardman production team flex their animation muscles it s nothing less than a stop motion tour de force  bursting with charm  humor  invention and eye popping mise en scene this wonderful visual treat is done in stop action clay animation  a form which is both substantial and magical  it s as if the clay figures kids make have managed to take on a life of their own this first feature by nick park and peter lord  the team that brought you wallace and gromit  is a diabolically witty piece of work  a haymaker most of the laughs stem from the peculiar appeal of claymation    something about a raised eyebrow or other subtle bit of expression just seems funnier at the stop motion speed of claymation apart from looking like no other type of animated film  chicken run stands alone in its unwavering determination not to play down to the kiddies chicken run isn t just chock full of references to classic prison break movies and some witty inside hollywood jokes  but is filled with a secret ingredient sadly missing from its super digitized  merchandise driven counterparts  heart chicken run  aardman s first full length animated feature  finally makes good on the promise of the studio s award winning shorts it is not only an amazing technical accomplishment  it s also the wittiest and best voiced animated movie to come along in years chicken run boasts the most delicious collection of desperately funny brits since the full monty  poultry has never been so stuffed with personality the finale and a scene set inside the pie making machinery prove that the rube goldberg formula is infallible  and the puns    another staple of crossover animation    range from  fowl  to  poultry in motion there are some mighty fine laughs in this clever claymation cartoon from the creator of england s hilarious wallace and gromit movies the level of invention on display  from the vividly detailed models and figurines to the gallery of memorable supporting characters  is astonishing at any length fab animation from wallace and gromit creator chicken run s  finale is on par both with  the great escape  and the classic wallace and gromit ending to  a close shave  for rousing excitement and ingenuity  when it comes to clever and fun entertainment with a twist  it s the cock of the walk the sophisticated humor of peter lord and nick park s very funny comedy is more likely to strike a nerve with adults thoroughly endearing family entertainment exactly the picker upper this macho movie summer needs park s love for all his characters  good and evil  is literally palpable  these characters have been forged of clay  fussed over  posed  photographed over a period of years that rare animated film that can easily please all age groups it d be churlish to carp about this triumph of craftsmanlike technique i know i ve seen a good funny animal movie if i stop eating the animal in real life inventiveness taken to new levels   simply a marvel i don t think two minutes went by where i wasn t laughing out loud it has intelligence  humor  drama and tragedy  dance numbers  amour and more  any of which will have appeal to someone out there it s a wonder to know that each frame of this film was handmade  not orchestrated by a computer insufferably twee something about nick park s characters is intrinsically hilarious    maybe it s those teeth a sharp  witty movie that finally answers the age old question  what do chickens do when you re not looking it s hard to make bits of clay flutter like feathers  but somehow they do the lavish coops  detailed pie machine and realistic lighting are just a small thread in a beautiful canvas of stirring images the poultry cast are capable of an extraordinary range of expression  especially during the sad or mildly scary scenes i highly recommend you check this out on the big screen  the deeply ironic undertones will keep adults and kids entertained alike full of humor for every age group  capped off with the message that perseverance and teamwork pay off what really makes it special  more than the impressive animation  is the endearing characters and involving plot filled with heroism  humor and heart  this wonderful film is a treat for the entire family like the computer animators at pixar  the stop motion wizards at aardman realize their technical prowess would be wasted without a worthy script gets by on the elements of fun and frivolity common to all the aardman animations apresenta um visual arrebatador may not maintain quite the same frantic level of invention as the wallace and gromit shorts  but it has more heart fans of the more subversive wallace and gromit tales are almost bound to be somewhat disappointed by this safer  more mainstream effort clever  funny and thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end fowl by no means  this film is no feather in the cap  either in short  it s everything you could hope for from an aardman feature chicken run movie review pure poultry the real magic of chicken run is how personable it is  how easy and effortlessly it tells its story there are last minute rescues and incredible visuals for adults  it can get mushy and repetitious  though the overall sweetness and ingenuity shoveled into it makes you want to love the movie more than you re able when mel gibson passes on to that big screen in the sky  don t be surprised if he s best remembered for playing a flirtatious rooster mostly good  lighthearted entertainment with more than its share of bad chicken punschicken run is one of those movies that plays well to children  but also has plenty of dry jokes that will keep adults entertained as well playful  infectious  and totally extraordinary oh  chicken run is a good movie  no doubt  it s also fairly entertaining  but oscar caliber before our disbelieving eyes  a pageant of jeopardy  romance and rescue unfolds a charming  fanciful and whimsical tale of love  bondage and the quest for escape from the awful fate of being turned into nuggets it s immensely satisfying  a divinely relaxed and confident film  mr  park and mr  lord brilliantly integrate everyday objects into the story simple  but engaging the first feature from the creators of wallace and gromit is a plucking good time it s a remarkably well sustained spin on the popular p o w  camp movie  with a touch of the squawkshank redemptions about it  too you ll want to see chicken run more than once chicken run rules the roost a triumph for park and lord f a better  funnier  smarter  more endearing film than chicken run comes along this year  i will eat a live chicken and shoot the feathers out my butt worth four clucks for the buck a delightful  perceptive  funny  detail perfect fable excellent visuals  a tenderly told tale  laughs aplenty  and a positive social message to boot it may also even have the power to make you think twice the next time you run through the drive thru at your local kfc everyone except poultry farmers and airline companies should rejoice at the creation of this wonderful claymation movie the film manages to cross all barriers  it should be accessible to both children and adults  brits and yanks  rats and chickens vegetarian propaganda  aimed at the kiddie audience  of course  but chicken run is also  and most impressively  an ideal marriage of style and subject matter the filmmakers  care for the story and its telling is somehow obvious to even the youngest viewer full of little surprises many will appreciate the genial  good natured goofiness chicken run is great fowl play escapism it s extraordinary how stylized chickens made of clay can exhibit such touching emotion an animated farce with    uproarious actiona magical movie the entire family can enjoy if the aardman menagerie strikes you as funny  the movie will too the stars of this fowl adventure also have hilarious foibles  eccentric habits  diverse personalities and a lot of spunk i m half tempted to run for the border on this one run is the rare exception of a film that is extremely enjoyable across the entire demographic board and although the pace is uneven and the plot seems stretched thin  chicken run is still worth a lookchicken run is the rare  true original in modern movies  it will delight you beyond words  don t even think about missing it for older children and adults  it s thin soup but there s something more going on here  an almost palpable joy in the ability of the animators to turn colorful clay into charming  amusing characters it s a very smart film it really is quite funny a movie both hilarious and sometimes heart stoppingly exciting few filmmakers are better at setting up a sight gag than co director co creators nick park and peter lord while the average chicken may hold as much interest to you as a dead duck  this film s chickens are well defined characters that make you laugh  feel worry for them  and then laugh even more fun even with your eyes closed  the jokes and britishisms and sound effects work all by themselves it s the great escape as performed by chickens and is every bit as good as you could imagine one of the funniest  best written movies of the year this chicken has legs    lots of them the slapstick  quick timing  and colorful characters may keep the kids occupied  but the sharp dialogue and tender moments will make the adults enjoy it even more a witty  action packed story assembled with painstaking finesse and obsessiveness  this film is imbued with infectious pluck lots of groovy chicks  scads of cheep thrills and a studly rooster with a comb over to die for a movie so sweet  so open and honest that we savor its charm and bathe in its confidence fun and amazingly rendered  but ultimately a little flat this is a tale of toil  sacrifice  and hard earned victory without a speck of fairy dust or dreamy eyed fantasy it s smart and charming  a family film in the best sense    a multi layered feast where all ages will find much to enjoy mel gibson as a chicken a pleasing and likable comedy that will entertain virtually all age groups a delightfully clever feature it all builds to a fabulously frantic  hilarious action packed climax chicken run delivers dreamworks rules  and chicken run is king it s as much a treat for adults as for children  with humor that spans all age ranges and careens from sophisticated to just plain silly there is something wonderfully improbable  anachronistic and quixotic about chicken run what makes chicken run so successful is the filmmakers  obvious love for clay animation a fun filled film chicken run is  in every way possible  great filmmaking delivers just about every bit of all around entertainment i could ask for from a movie about chickens escaping from the farm an ingenious  g rated claymation adventure you will believe a chicken has teeth it s so much fun chicken run is the most delightful piece of feature length animation to debut this summer could be this summer s sleeper  or this summer s the iron giant aardman delivers the most consistently entertaining animated film in years it could do for the plight of poultry what babe did for bacon there s plenty to cluck about chicken run is a delight for kids and adults it s always risky to count your chickens before they re hatched  even so  i have to say that chicken run deserves to be a runaway hit funny in eggs ecution and fabulous in design there s hardly ever a lull in the action the high flying fun is limited solely be the poultry running time a spunky and hilarious story about the yearning for freedom in the heart of a very determined hen on a farm in the english countryside rarely does a prison film delight and amuse imagine mel gibson playing the james garner role in the great escape  now  imagine mel gibson in feathers does the nick park charm work for a feature film  in my opinion  not really chicken run should be seen by the whole family  actually  it should be seen by everyone one of the most entertaining vehicles of the year it s an entertaining warm up  a few bits of brilliance packed in disposable kiddie fluff nannandirector david yates deals with this change of tone skillfully director chris columbus has pushed the envelope farther  made a sequel that is pacier and more swashbuckling  yet it still feels cautious and reined in harry potter and the chamber of secrets is darker  funnier and finer than its forerunner harry potter and the philosopher s stone chamber of secrets is funnier and more exciting than the first harry potter movie  and adorned with some of the most stunning special effects ever harry potter and the chamber of secrets isn t perfect  but it s everything it should be  fun  exciting  humorous and stirring have no fear  you legions of potter fans  harry potter and the chamber of secrets is a solid step forward in the movie adaptations of j k  rowling s much read novels harry potter and the chamber of secrets is good enough to satisfy hard core fans  even if it falls short of being truly transporting moviemaking columbus  pacing is still murderously slow  his ideas as pedestrian as the worst tv despite its sophomoric awkwardness  the chamber of secrets is a welcome delivery of childlike wonder for a planet of ever  increasing ugliness although it s unlikely to make converts of the uninitiated  fans of the series and its characters will find the movie to be a worthy entry it appears that the production has learned from its mistakes and managed to put together the kind of film that deserves to be a part of young adult film folklore for generations to come this new harry potter has its flaws  but it s better  as well as darker  than the first two down  presumably five to go  and already the franchise is entering dangerous territory  if you aren t one of the many who know their harry potter chapter and verse  prepare for a nap columbus carefully avoids overly replaying the visual wonders of his first episode  and heedfully edits and amplifies rowling s story for the screen  preserving its spooky darkness better story  better acting  better characters and better effects  all they need is to sort out the dialogue next time  and everyone s a winner the three main child actors  including emma watson as hermione  have gained in confidence and grown nicely into their roles and all of the regular ensemble from the first film return it doesn t help that chamber is pretty much all business from the opening shot  trading in stone s sometimes clunky exposition for full steam ahead action a good entertaining film with a lot of imagination   possibly second only to goblet of fire of all the potter films to date  chamber of secrets should please fans and muggles alike those who adore the books may bemoan the flat emotional landscape of the films  which are less easy to engage with  fans of the first film will be suitably entertained like many children i ve met  director chris columbus seems never to have heard the word no scary spiders  impressive effects and a barnstorming branagh add pizzazz to potter action  and creature packed potter sequel everything about the sorcerer s stone pretty much applies to the adaptation of the second novel in the series allow yourself the luxury of discovering this enchanted world for yourself the exciting second chapter in the harry potter chronicle that in many ways surpasses the original though these films are trifles  they are at least high quality trifles may just be the most quintessential steven spielberg movie steven spielberg never made this second effort is even better than the first go around an enjoyable sequel it s good enough that i might just start taking an interest in the books after all back is chris columbus  whose direction this time around has a purposely darker  more ominous look harry potter and the chamber of secrets  satisfies as a film adaptation  but it doesn t cast as enchanting a spell as the first movie the second film to spring forth from j k  rowling s popular series of children s books goes a long way towards amping up the dramatic tension promised by the source material this is as rousing and faithful an adaptation as was possible it s a depressing reality to face  but the second of j k  rowling s boy wizard books was the least interesting read    and hasn t fared much better on film the franchise is showing no fear at exploring the novels  darker moments  but needs to judiciously pare down the time it takes for the lights to come up blood is splattered on walls  pre teen students are turned to stone  a poltergeist ian tree tries to smash our heroes  spiders rampage across the dark forest and a giant snake cruises menacingly through dank catacombs the humor and the villainy have bite  the acting has conviction  the effects look far less cheesy  and the storytelling actually conveys the imagination and emotional power of rowling s prose before it degenerates into indiana potter and the chamber of doom  the movie holds promise punishingly long and slow in parts director chris columbus and company have done a stand out job of capturing the imagination if not the detail of those books    provides wondrous surprises around every turn i still don t understand how j k  rowling could have made such obscene gobs of cash off of such a simple and overwrought premise     i ll stick with lord of the ringsan effort that is full of gosh wow moments harry potter and the chamber of secrets surpasses sorcerer s stone as a crisper  more action packed film  which will more than thrill the billions of harry potter fans everywhere it s fairly solid  not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn t feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark no less magical  no less engaging  and no less kid pleasing than its record breaking predecessor  it s also no shorter   harry potter and the chamber of secrets works the kind of magic that hollywood rarely displays  it s a sequel that s better than the original represents a lost opportunity to give children  not to mention adults  a movie experience that would widen their eyes as the justly beloved rowling books did an enchanting spectacular for potter fans anxious to ride the hogwarts express toward a new year of magic and mischief this film is basically one big scooby doo episode offers a more imaginatively colourful world than almost every other children s film out there     the script is tight enough and moves along with such blazing speed that it suffers from the only failing grace of the original did  can audience members who haven t read the books keep up the chamber of secrets   while more visually striking and entertaining  still suffers from many of the same problems that plagued  the sorcerer s stone one of those rare sequels that is as good as the original movie how desperate is columbus if his creepy spiders look  act  and sound just like the eight legged freakssequentially and tonally  it s so derivative of the last movie that it not only fails to build upon its predecessor  it s stuck covering the very same ground slick and sophisticated  if same y where the first film was the exposition  the follow up is the reward   taking our heroes on a darker  more rewarding journey as we watch them deepen and mature with time a rich and rewarding family entertainment experience that teens and adults will thoroughly enjoy more    as will the kids the film is muddled by its slavish dedication to the minutiae of events and at the same time  erases those aspects of the book that gave it real social and political urgency lots of fun and action  laughs and mystery  and really  isn t that why we love harry potter  branagh brilliant i stopped thinking about how good it all was  and started doing nothing but reacting to it   feeling a part of its grand locations  thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled  feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness  gasping at its visual delights after struggling interminably to bring the first of the obscenely popular harry potter novels to the screen  director chris columbus finally cracks the code with his second effort unnecessarily lengthy and repetitious  but still has a certain charm that can offer entertainment for both children and adults this second succulent serving of harry potter may be all over the map like a feeble minded person looking for interstate highway directions  but it does lend itself to do what it s suppose to do   whisk diehard moviegoers away to another dynamic dimensionchris columbus  shortcomings in ingenuity and imagination don t seem terribly detrimental since the material he s working with is so infused with magic and witdirector chris columbus has made a darker  quicker movie of it than he did of the sorcerer s stone  with particularly fine settings and atmosphere in all fairness  i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed  fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks desta vez  columbus capturou o pomo de ouro like the first  pott ah  movie  the scenery was amazing and the music was great  throw in the story that everybody loves and these movies really have the whole package the special effects enchant all    no matter what your age the magic of the books seems to be having trouble making the transition to big screen though the lack of nuance is regrettable  there s much to enjoy grab a broomstick and sail along for the ride in fact  harry potter and the chamber of secrets is darker than harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  slightly  especially in its sideways engaging of race prejudice this is a vastly superior movie  capturing all the things that i felt were missing from the first made so well that all ages can appreciate it snappier than the first the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year doing away with the formalities helps chamber of secrets immensely  allowing it to concentrate on unfolding its involving mystery  using the running time to pace the action and the development simply put  if you liked sorcerer s stone  you ll like chamber of secrets contains little of the first film s exciting fantasy appeal    an imaginative  often entertaining journey into self realization that s well worth the trip these potter kids have grown up a lot in one year  at this rate  their next adventure will be harry potter and the octogenarian s enlarged prostate now that s more like it where chamber of secrets will be viewed a success is in accurately  and occasionally imaginatively  bringing the book to life  as a movie  judged on its own merits  it s too long  too slow and too unfocused this overlong sequel is short of magic progress was made in all departments  despite an apocalyptic occurrence that looked likely to close hogwarts for ever not great  but worth seeing terrific fun  a sequel with more self assurance than most original films can muster a pretty wondrous creation harry potter and the chamber of secrets is a solid work  it s effortlessly entertaining  generously faithful to j k  rowling s book    and thrilling most viewers  especially the younger ones  will reap its joys big  dull and empty just as there is more magic conjured up in chamber of secrets the book  chamber of secrets the movie weaves a more powerful spell over its audience chris columbus makes the novel s transformation into a big budget feature look effortless  and the film s darker tone is more satisfying than that of the first  a somewhat forced happy ending notwithstanding much of what made the first film so enchanting remains firmly in place  from the strong ensemble performances through stuart craig s magnificent production design the best blend of human activity with computer animation since  who framed roger rabbit  this time out  director chris columbus waves his wand in all the right directions  the funny scenes are funnier  the scary scenes are scarier just as often the film is as monotonous and despair inducing as three hours on an airplane with nothing to read but the in flight magazine the result is better than the sorcerer s stone  but still feels slightly bloated and unfocused the godfather ii of family films once again  director chris columbus takes a hat in hand approach to rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours the magic still sparkles in harry potter and the chamber of secrets doesn t dally around and far more action packed than the first a lot more nimble than the first movie the whole harry potter thing may not be as fresh for moviegoers as it was last year  but thankfully chamber of secrets is well crafted secrets is pretty much a wash with the first potter movie  not much in the way of captivating magic  but all the expected notes are duly played it s a fun flick  even though its wizardry is more technical than imaginative while it still falls short of becoming the classic fans so badly want it to be  the film is livelier and better overall than the sorcerer s stone  mostly because j k  rowling got all that tiresome exposition over with the first time out although very much like the first movie based on j k  rowling s phenomenal fantasy best sellers  this second go round possesses a quite pleasing  headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude there are enough pleasures here to guarantee a diverting time to all but the most curmudgeonly muggles darker  scarier  funnier and more fun filled the film is quite lengthy  but so brisk and busy at all times that it quite flies by this movie  like the first  is more of a translation than an adaptation  it s the visual equivalent of an audio book  slightly abridged this is a critic proof film  how nice that it doesn t need to be in order to succeed dark  resonant  inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement so so entertainment not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved  and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry  but the film conjures the magic of author j k  rowling s books the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins entertaining and moves nimbly enough to keep your way back seat from turning to stone just as harry and friends are fighting the forces of darkness  the film s great elements are struggling toward the spotlight it s  well  spellbinding if you were like me and didn t particularly care for the first installment  i don t think this one will completely reverse your opinion where  stone  was a pretty bauble all dressed up with nowhere to emote   secrets  is a genuinely scary sequel that remembers to bring its heart along  too  scratch that  it brings its guts it s not always lovelier the second time around  but still  this  harry  shows some magic when neededthe special effects and cgi  uneven in sorcerer s stone  are all spit shine and shoe polish in chamber of secrets  there isn t one hair out of place chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans  but if the essence of magic is its make believe promise of life that soars above the material realm  this is the opposite of a truly magical movie it s still easy to fall for this sorcerer s spell i can t think of a movie this long that has left me so starved for a movie harry potter and the chamber of secrets is superior to its predecessor in every way  it s more thrilling  more entertaining and  yep  more magical two and a half hours of unadulterated fun the kids will be just as wild about harry the second time around  but adults had better be ready to take the multiple choice quiz in advance overall  the movie feels brighter  smarter and sleeker than the first as a companion piece to harry potter and the sorcerer s stone  harry potter and the chamber of secrets makes for effective viewing despite terrific special effects and funnier gags  harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j k  rowling s marvelous series into a deadly bore the first movie was the setup  and this one is the payoff despite a potpourri of minor delights  the film ends up a disappointment the chamber of secrets may not be a classic  but it s more eventful than its predecessor chamber of secrets is not quite the magical mystery tour that the first one was  despite some major improvements  the movie is often sluggish in pacing and intrigue the continuing story of everyone s favorite boy wizard is a visual feast    and darker than the first installment returns the original s cast and director  and retains that film s winning combination of limitless imagination and exhilarating adventure swims in mediocrity  sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then when it comes to the imagination scale  harry potter has everything it needs  but what does it all really amount to in the end  not much of a payoff  i m afraid as with the original film  there s little to offend the most myopic fan of the books  but also little room for the imaginative extension of the author s universe that distinguishes an inspired adaptation from a merely workmanlike one it captures all the magic  mystery  excitement and wonder from j k  rowling s book in a way that plays extremely well on screen bigger  faster  funnier  and darker    but  lacks the deep soul and character nuances of its predecessor it s good  genuinely good  not just as a cultural sensation but as a movie all its own about on par with the first from a pure entertainment standpoint a little better than sorcerer s stone if you liked one  you ll like the otherlike the first film  it cleaves too faithfully to the source material  but it always fills the screen with spectacle harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again  and while that is a cliche  nothing could be more appropriate  it s likely that whatever you thought of the first production    pro or con    you ll likely think of this one as the empire strikes back was to star wars  so harry potter and the chamber of secrets is to last year s freshman introduction  in short  it s bigger and better if the kids are more serious in their play this time around  then the grownups are just having a blast whisks us away for more adventures that keep us on the edge of our seats cheering for these three young wizards whose resourcefulness in the face of the unknown is awesome deepening and widening an imaginative world full of cleverly detailed creatures  much as j k  rowling has done in her books  chamber is a speedy  funny winner faster paced and more chock full of adventure than the original it s smartly produced and slightly more streamlined than sorcerer s stone  its predecessor  but at almost three hours it s still too slavishly faithful to its source and will no doubt try the patience of muggle moppets in his second year at the hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry  the cinematic harry potter shows improvement  but he has a ways to go before earning top marks from screaming mandrake plants to animal transfiguration to ethereal letters literally hanging in the air   columbus   approach to the books  enchanting elements is marvelous to behold darker  scarier and somewhat better than sorcerer s stone ironically enough  chamber of secrets has more of a narrative arc  but consequently lacks much urgency  it does retain the wonderment that made the first film fun chris columbus  sequel is faster  livelier and a good deal funnier than his original once again the production values    the sets  costumes and props    are pure perfection it remains an expertly assembled companion piece to its source material  with charms you can t overlook  but the great harry potter should be casting a more powerful spell even though chamber of secrets is a vast improvement  columbus  directorial touch remains more caring than inspired proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books  they can t go wrong  better effects  better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh  an excellent sequel mercilessly padded  the movie drags us through ages of all too familiar territory there s just enough of the old to feel at home and provide continuity  just enough of the new to keep things fresh the series has progressed from reciting j k  rowling s source novels to paraphrasing them when it was all over  i could easily proclaim the chamber of secrets as a vastly superior film on every level  one that i ll be willing to devote more time to again and again in the future exactly what you d expect from a movie that features a self mutilating house elf all the things that made the first film a hit with its target audience columbus overcomes several of the first film s problems with this much darker  slightly more edgy sequel it nearly overwhelms its own inherent magical wonders and characters with an emphasis on action  but the movie also manages to work its way out from under the heavy hallowed aura that partially smothered the fun of its predecessor their thoughts were how to make the book into a movie  not how to make a great movie kids will have nightmares for weeks and adults will be entertained for hours   an improvement on harry potter and the sorcerer s stone more dutiful than enchanting   terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat exactly the kind of slam bang adventure that s certain to please audiences of all ages for the time being  the harry potter thrill ride is whizzing along very satisfactorily indeed chamber of secrets is fairly fun despite its length another successful wild ride  thanks to a very entertaining source  a keen and fairly faithful adaptation  and top notch special effects a vast improvement over last year s film  bloated as it was with quidditch matches and monster moments that didn t advance the plot one iota that the film is a worthy swan song for richard harris is first a surprise then an incalculable relief  and destined to be the proudest legacy of the picture  a beautifully crafted dark fable chamber s charm lies in the sheer visualization of rowling s weirder inventions this time  the hype is quieter  and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first  it s still a rollicking good time for the most part this one does for the series what the wrath of khan did for star trek a watered down  cg saturated nod to moviemaking convention lots more of the same isn t better harry s latest adventure has enough snakes  mandrakes  phoenix tears  cornish pixies  climaxes and denouements to scare the j r r  tolkien out of you a good sequel and should please all the potter fans who made the first film a blockbuster the second installment is scarier  darker  longer and even better than the first  it s an enchanting  enthralling  eye popping miracle of moviemaking without the newness of the first film to give it some electricity  this harry potter outing comes off as harmless but flat once again  chris columbus stays out of j k  rowling s way  sticking to the text and hitting each narrative beat cleanly and vigorously chris columbus  the director  does a real wonderful job of being faithful to the story but also taking it into a cinematic era incredibly  once again  screenwriter steve kloves and director chris columbus deliver a movie without passion the special effects here will have you reclining in your seat  admiring the spectacle  unfortunately  the film s pedestrian pacing won t get you on the edge of it it is on every count a better movie than last year s first film installment the sense of discovery  that initial encounter with the stories  vivid characters and whimsical parallel universe  is missing  in its stead comes frantic activity boy wizard and his faithful friends battle evil in a magical boarding school  you know  like last time gives columbus the chance to indulge himself with fascinatingly realistic special effects and riveting action sequences mostly fun  somewhat enchanting  and at a few turns    surprisingly spooky nanscenes that should have been uproarious are weaker than many of the movie s smaller moments  whose everyday humor isn t specific to the plot or characters star driven comedy at times offensive and funny    large swaths of the proceedings feel as though they d be more at home within a garden variety sitcom what gives the film its special kick is the match of stiller and de niro nobody plays put upon quite like ben stiller alas  poor focker  he can t help himself  and we can t help ourselves from falling about  equally helpless  at this superbly antic movie packed with cringe worthy moments from beginning to end  jay roach s comedy is for anyone who has ever endured a weekend in the company of potential in laws director jay roach of the austin powers films keeps the pace brisk  and the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high stiller portrays a human accident better than anyone and he definitely knows how to extort laughs and sympathy from his audiencecontains enough belly laughs and sly jokes to become one of the bigger crowd pleasers of the fall astutely observed  subtly played and consistently hilarious   never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffes a definite must see that s perfect for a guys  night out or a relaxing date an entertaining little outing  but not something that will stay with me does the usual hollywood bit of setting up the gags way in advance so that even a coma patient can spot them as far as one joke movies go  this one has its guffaws stiller plays a familiar character with a nice energy and presence  making the most of all his character s asides and observations guaranteed to put you off suggested sunday outings for life this film is almost too real to be funny  it is one uncomfortable moment after another   and that is what stiller does best  but director roach would have done well to tone it down a bit stiller has a gift for looking funny effortlessly  when he s doing nothing physical  with no mugging  no physical contortions  he turns his face into a palette of pain and confusion what saves the movie from remaining an exercise in self parody for all involved is director roach s feel for the material this is  unquestionably  the best comedy currently on release  highly recommended great filmmaking this is not  but if you re looking for an amusing  undemanding couple of hours  give this a try overbearingly cruel and only modestly funny this simple but well constructed comedy picks a situation that naturally causes anxiety   meeting your in laws   and turns it into a walk through hell i m eagerly awaiting a sequel too many actors make the error of thinking that being funny involves lots of hysteria and hyperactivity  but de niro knows that good comic acting is no different than good dramatics  the performance must be grounded in truth consistently more fun than it has any right to be  meet the parents is an example of how sometimes it really is all about casting the right couple of stars this truth doesn t hurt as much as the infamous franks and beans scene from there s something about mary  but the pain and the laughter last longer when the script puts its faith in the audience  allowing us to find the laughs on our own  the film is irresistible  a bright lark  yet when the writers panic  upping the antic volume and shifting into crazed sitcom gear  the lark stops solid  sadistic stiller fare one of those cruel yet very funny crowd pleasers it was a well acted  likable and benignly amusing film ben stiller is simply fantastic  and this deniro kid could be big someday a non stop riot headed up by the first rate pairing of ben stiller and robert deniro a hilarious hodgepodge of the in laws and annie hall  in which de niro gives his best comic performance to date a straightforward romantic comedy that doesn t take a lot of chances  but still manages to deliver the goods stiller  who is shaping up to be one of the most adept comic performers of our time  does a terrific job of building sympathy for the hapless outsider a five star hoot the sight gags and verbal repartee hinge upon uninspired  lowest common denominator hijinks meet the parents generates most of its laughs in the give and take between stiller and de niro    highly amusing   at times leaves most of the men in the audience throwing their heads back and realizing exactly how realistic the situation at hand is a brilliant comedy in which we laugh that we do not cry    although we do wince  as every expectation the main character has of things turning out okay crumbles and his face gets ever the redder deliciously funny and warmly poignant  it s a treat to meet the parents ben stiller  an excellent comic actor  does some of his best work here  matched up with one of the all time greats  robert de niro none of the jokes are forced  which makes meet the parents a singular achievement even with stiller and de niro  meet the parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it s available on video  roach  does know how to stage discrete comic moments  taking mildly humorous nightmares and turning them into nicely wrought miniatures meet the parents builds brilliantly on interlocking comic situations with current comedy obsessed with oh so clever ironic gestures and tricksy pastiche  meet the parents  dedication to consistent  straightforward belly laughs is totally refreshing the jokes work  because they are so relentless and absurd meet the parents gets its best moments in the friction between de niro and stiller  their screen personas    the intimidator and the hapless smart guy    are a perfect mismatch  and the spark between them ignite plenty of laughs stiller is brilliant most of the humor here is pretty clever meet the parents doesn t sparkle like vincente minnelli s father of the bride  but with bubbly adult comedies at such a premium  it goes down like a flute of champagne  leaving an aftertaste of giggles there is a sub category of comedy     in which we laugh at the hideously humiliating experiences of some poor sap  if this is your kind of humor  than this is your kind of movie funny bits abound  overstuffed to the point of tearing at the seams  the film might have benefited from a bit more cutting  a string of non stop humor flat out hilarious deniro is the real pleasure to watch if de niro s mafia comedy analyze this went for cheap laughs  meet the parents develops real depth an unfathomably awful film that will undoubtedly be a smash hit meet the parents might not be sophisticated comedy  but it s certainly enjoyable though meet the parents features a capable supporting cast  the laughs come almost exclusively from the tussle between stiller and de niro  and both deliver i haven t laughed this hard since the trailer for billy elliot very fun and very entertaining an entertaining comic nightmare  but like most bad dreams  it disappears once the lights come up in many ways reminiscent of there s something about mary with all due respect to giggles  though  you would do better to rent raging bull an adult oriented comedy that  while hardly reserved  rests its very funny foundation on well conceived characterization  lively dialogue and good acting with near swiss precision  director producer jay roach     and his writers make sure familiarity breeds hilarity passable movie entertainment  but like most future in laws leaves a feeling of something still desired de niro delivers this is one hell of a funny movie  folks whenever the movie is about to go wrong  something happens to set it right    usually instigated by the coldly mean de niro or the hot  nervous stiller wonderfully funny meet the parents is much too herky jerky to be completely successful  and it follows each laugh out loud scene with one that is completely    or is at least a bit    cringe worthy i literally found myself gasping for breath during meet the parents  most comic moments  wishing i could rewind the film i had a good time at meet the parents  even though the ratio of clinkers to yucks is disproportionately high the film is uproarious without ever becoming nasty or mean spirited high concept that aims for the middle and meets its mark emphatically and satisfyingly i can t remember when i last laughed so hard during a film  deniro and stiller are a perfect match and i walked out of the theater wanting to see more of these characters quite simply  this focker has us laughing out loud frequently and abundantly robert de niro and ben stiller give the comedy of disaster a nice little workout more often than not  the movie s tension gets in the way of its giggles  falling back on its stars  comedy instincts and over extended running gags the real comic bite comes from the combustible energy between the two lead actors a very funny movie that is able to combine a great premise with ideal actors  laugh out scenes with a sentimental touch and over the top sequences with a believable story line a crisply paced romp featuring pitch perfect performances by adversarial leads robert de niro and ben stiller while it s a truism that all comedy has an element of sadism  it doesn t necessarily follow that all sadism is funny a comedy that has likeable  human characters as well as consistent laughs watching ben get the girl or be seriously injured trying always has its dry  keening pleasures it s warm and humorous and avoids being mean spirited  which alone makes it special plays like a thirty minute sitcom that overstays its welcome for more than an hour this fall s pleasant surprise jay roach  best known for the broad farce of the austin powers films  shows an unexpected flair for directing character comedy with meet the parents  mainstream hollywood reclaims one of its former strengths  it proves that it still knows how to provide audiences with a good time it never quite gets going great fun i didn t laugh so often as many of the people sitting around me at meet the parents  but i laughed enough to think  yep  not bad once again  roach smokes  meet the parents is an extremely pleasant surprise  a high concept romantic comedy that actually works the gross out factor is surprisingly low  and the combination of stiller and de niro is inspired  no father could be more formidable  no prospective son in law better equipped to squirm roach     knows to play to the movie s twin strengths  stiller and de niro de niro  once again proving that he understands comedy as well as urban psychoses possibly the most amusing mainstream live action comedy since there s something about mary unlike most family squabbles  you ll find this one an amusing diversion it s funny  really funny never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffs even better than there s something about mary a very funny movie there s hardly anything surprising about meet the parents  except that it s much funnier than you might expect meet the parents has all the elements of either a bedroom farce or a hardy boys mystery  turns out it s the former  and a mighty funny one at that you couldn t do much better than to pit de niro at his most humorlessly imposing against ben stiller at his most anxiously eager to please a refreshing change from the current trend of gross and grosser humor it never runs out of steam or ways of inflicting more ignominy on stiller meet the parents is a one     well  maybe two     joke idea that starts out goofy and fun  but soon runs out of verbal or visual ammunition this isn t ernst lubitsch or anything  but the movie is consistently funny without the calculated gross out moments that have been dominating mainstream comedy in recent years if you can just accept the fact that real human behavior has been thrown out the window like the baby in andy warhol s bad  then you ll have a really good time watching stiller and de niro square off within its formulaic confines  the humor works uncommonly well from time to time if ever there was a movie that felt like it was built backward  it s meet the parents a clever situation comedy that delivers quite a few laughs you feel you ve seen it all before  there s something about mary did it funnier  and the heartbreak kid did it wiser  but when stiller is let loose  you never feel that charles grodin did it drier uneven in tone  often trite and certainly neither de niro nor stiller s finest  meet the parents is nevertheless a funny and sometimes substantial movie see it with someone you love    and maybe with his or her parents it s the prom night scene from there s something about mary stretched out over an entire movie   just not as funny has all the elements for a memorable farce and succeeds more often than not a good spirited comedy meet the parents is hysterical don t go to this movie if you ve recently had hernia surgery  because the expression  bust a gut laughing  might go beyond metaphor in your case a comedy that works for the most part while in other sections has the audience waiting for a tv laugh track that doesn t come a hilarious comedy about the ridiculous lenghts a young man goes to in order to prove himself to his girlfriend s family stiller and de niro play off well against each other  and neither goes too far off the deep end it s laugh out loud funny follows a rather predictable  well worn path  but the sheer joy of performing on the actors  parts sells the film as a whole while it doesn t quite live up to its potential  it s still a heck of a lot funnier than what usually passes for comedy in these days that the film works in spite of the people behind the camera says a lot for the people in front of the camera there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy  certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written nannannannannannannanstreamlining larsson s clunky storytelling  zaillan injects a welcome streak of humour into events  giving craig   and the rest of the superb cast   a chance to be both funny and icily ominous a mesmerizing thriller anchored by a brilliant  revelatory performance by rooney mara when you watch the film  you ll understand immediately why people are obsessed with its story  fincher s movie  far truer to the novel than the swedish version  will be a treat for fans of larsson s series filmmaker david fincher is extremely conscious of the details he needs to exhibit to keep each isolated moment at a highly concentrated level overall  fincher s version is a chilly crime procedural  worth a watch but not world burning in any way all in all  the girl with the dragon tattoo is a good film and worth a visit  but do yourself a real favor and watch the original swedish version before  after or instead of this one larsson was a natural heir to mankell s style  but unlike his progenitor s work  both the book and film versions of the girl with the dragon tattoo lack wallander s good heart overall the movie does take allegiances with both the book and original movie  but it comes into its own to unravel a truly alluring story deep down  the girl with the dragon tattoo is sheer pulp an elegant balance between light and dark  the girl with the dragon tattoo benefits from fincher s ascetic treatment  and will silence any of the naysayers who felt the whole american version was little more than a money grab i can t help but puzzle over the new lisbeth and what  exactly  this film is lacking that doesn t make it fincher level great steve zaillian s script trims some the novel s fat  keeping the film a lean  mean and frightening beast whilst fincher doesn t exactly blow the original out of the water  he does add enough to make the project feel less like an unnecessary retread than it otherwise may have fincher takes repeated stabs at creating depth but seldom draws blood in attempting to flesh out characters that just aren t that interesting  david fincher s hollywood take on the stieg larsson bestseller is a sleek yet somehow soulless adaptation a compelling ride for die hard fans of the book series  dramatic thriller enthusiasts  as well as anyone who enjoys fincher s darker works while this film is a brilliant  dispassionate rival to the also brilliant swedish original  the films that could really use the fincher treatment are the two sequels fincher s the girl with the dragon tattoo manages to build on the original film without copying it  reinventing it or ignoring it feels surprisingly tame thanks to weakened characters and story changes that rob the mystery of much needed suspense the girl with the dragon tattoo can t quite transcend its junk foundation or   the familiar beats of the other adaptation a very moody  well made retelling of stieg larsson s book  but the film also lacks much purpose and sometimes focuses on the grim with an exploitative eye it s ultimately david fincher s perfectionist talent for creating a gripping aesthetic that raises this film above your average james patterson adaptation was it really worth the effort  for all fincher s famously fanatical control  he can t dispel the stench of half baked cheese that hangs over the source material i may be one of the few who prefers the original swedish tv version  but fincher does a nice job of staying faithful to the larsson novel and infusing it with his own sense of style if you enjoy a good mystery that s as grimy as a stomped on cigarette on the pavement then this film will have you hooked  fans of the books should be pleased it s an effective  if unfathomable  entry in the fincher canon i could not take my eyes off the film and never once wanted to exit the theatre  all of which are attributes i don t want to diminish or dispute in any way whatsoever the girl with the dragon tattoo  will leave its mark on you  dark  brutal and intriguing  this version is as troubling and memorable as its swedish counterpart  its disturbing tone begins in the opening credits and continues to the last frame david fincher never lets his movie devolve into a petty revenge fantasy  the filmmaker clearly got the novel and  consequently  gets the most out of the novel  girl with the dragon tattoo is just what the fans were demanding this stylish film soars  it s a remake worth seeingwhat fincher brings to the table is a particular talent for atmospheric  highly stylized mystery  what he can t really fix is the fact that the source material is  structurally  a mess this is still a slick  gripping thriller and fincher s stylish fingerprints can be seen all the way through fincher takes time to build the mystery slowly  showing the numbing amounts of research as well as details like freezing cold cabins and bad vending machine coffee  fincher s film is dark and twisted  bleak and brutal  everything the book s fans would want this is a finely honed genre thriller  but it also continues fincher s preoccupation with the persistence of age old urges in the modern world i liked it a lot fincher has delivered a visually striking  well acted  at times stomach churning thriller  but i still can t help but wish that he had taken a curve ball and continued exploring new territory rather than taking a big swing at an easy toss    an entertaining yet somewhat disappointing effort from fincher as he proved last year  david fincher can make the inherently uncinematic into thrilling cinema  fincher is the right director to make a movie where two people rifle through endless amounts of paperwork and old photos suspenseful a waste of a great director s time it is extraordinarily bleak  i mean  it s not requiem for a dream bleak  but it s on up there no one could fail to enjoy this movie  but it s the product of an art and an industry that went in different directions with the coming of sound  and popular english speaking audiences never became accustomed to reading subtitles there s nothing wrong with david fincher s remake  was it strictly necessary  that s debatable fincher s chilly  precision filmmaking knows how to tease  while still looking head on into the abyss a tense  unsettling plunge into a dark  toxic world where the bleak scandinavian setting isn t the only thing cold  cruel and unforgiving shockingly sexual  brilliantly acted  and overall strangely appealinga very impressive bit of storytelling and style that only steps wrongly in its final third everything else we re meant to care about is an afterthought compared to the sketch of a relationship at the fringe of the film which somehow benefits from not being at the center mara s performance stands on its own and likely gives birth to a new star for fincher purists  the girl with the dragon tattoo is lumpier in plot fluidity than his other  sleeker work  but his call sign is still very much present    the logic of a hollywood adaptation  for the benefit of a largely untapped domestic market  is clear  not least for the film s corporate sponsors  step forward mcdonalds and apple  two brave companies who ve tethered their brands to incest and murder vengeance is the ace card in this rough game of acquiring justice in a cloaked system with degenerates at every turn  and  it s a heavyweight component of the trilogy s impact no matter the medium used for its telling the girl with the dragon tattoo is everything you would expect from fincher s version of the book and that is the good and the bad  slick and entertaining throughout  there is absolutely nothing in it which surprises the bottom line is that if you were too lazy to read the subtitles in the original  you won t miss blomqvist s lack of swedish intellect this time handles the material competently  but not exceptionally a hypnotic cocktail of haunting visuals  strong performances and mesmerizing score  take the best bits of this captivating new work and cut them into the negligible flaws of the original film and you d have a perfect story the remake everyone s been talking about doesn t disappoint the ultimate poseur movie     a cinematic  temporary tattoo  a way of feeling underground without ever committing to anything real entertaining if blatantly sexual and sado masochistic  inducing thrills and chills fincher s twilight like hollywood heroine is shy and moody  not the venal  alternate lifestyle lesbian punk hacker from the beloved book  anybody else think mara s sex scenes with craig were done by a body double  h ow else are you going to tap into that lucrative market consisting of folks who read the books but are too lazy to read subtitles just as i couldn t stop turning the pages of larsson s novel  i couldn t take my eyes off fincher s movie  unable to make sense of larsson s already confused source material  fincher s film soon lapses into hypocrisy     grim but striking     still  fincher s remake is not up to the swedish adaptation  which was creepier and more exhilarating  especially as the old school new school investigatory methods kicked in  the movie feels like a cartoon  brilliantly achieved but utterly shallow charismatically played by rooney mara in david fincher s coolly executed  moody rendition of stieg larsson s book  this tattooed girl really does kick a hornet s nest  while it isn t clear if another version of the girl with the dragon tattoo is necessary  fincher couldn t make it boring with all this lurid material    but in any language with anyone at the helm  lisbeth is still a killer fortunately the book is virtually foolproof if you leave it to speak for itself  as  fincher  has done  thereby delivering a decent movie fincher s version oozes style  delivering an eye catching cinematic experience  while editing of the action is snappy if you re about to enter the world of the girl with the dragon tattoo for the first time  this is a terrific place to start can t think of too many times a hollywood version is so much superior to a european original rooney mara isn t quite as in your face as noomi rapace was playing lisbeth in the swedish films  yet she is both tough and sensitive   the master of the thriller genre  alfred hitchcock  knew that even the nastiest stories need light as well as shade  fincher s too busy darkening his garish source material to care unmissable it s certainly worth seeing if you missed the original  if you saw it  however  there s no way of unseeing it  and nothing in the new one to top it fincher s dragon tattoo rockets through the freezing northern european landscape like the most powerful car on the market fincher delivers a seedily compulsive glimpse into a cold  brutal universe seething with twisted passions  even if the story is little more than a slick  sick potboiler we know what will happen and it s still riveting i ve read the books and seen the better swedish version and still found this interesting and tense  despite the fact that the sex and violence are considerably toned down from the original reminds us why murder mysteries and investigative procedurals    useful parables about the certainty of death that have pretty much migrated to television    can be especially compelling in a darkened theater elegantly  confidently made  though it s so similar to the swedish movie it does seem kind of beside the point  an astonishing blend of dark allure and damaged brilliance  mara is compulsively watchable as lisbeth salander  while craig effectively embodies quiet integrity as the humiliated reporter fleeing the limelight while sharpening his investigatory skills what transfixes here isn t the labyrinthine plotting    we re almost overly familiar with that by now    but mara s lisbeth  surely one of the most incendiary antiheroines in all of cinemafincher s dragon tattoo is a faithful adaptation that brings the dazzle but shortchanges on the daring    it s gloriously rendered but too impersonal to leave a mark fincher has succeeded admirably  his girl with the dragon tattoo improves on both the book and the first movie director david fincher has crafted a disturbing dazzler of a thriller  embellished by sharp acting  extremely well made  ably acted  beautifully shot and has a plot full of hairpin turns and twists  it is an entirely engaging and occasionally gripping film  it is also completely unnecessary fincher is perfectly suited to the material  with its voluminous clues to be organized and parsed  its emotional austerity  and its serial murder  rape  and sundry sick plot twists fans of the original will like this version  but many will ultimately see director david fincher s film as more cookie cutter than classic  larsson himself would probably have loved this classier interpretation of his rather pulpy narrative suitably stylish remake from director david fincher  which succeeds thanks to a strong script  striking photography and superb performances from craig and mara fincher maintains a steady tension throughout  he also adds his own tweaks to the twists at the end location is fincher s strongest quality  and every log cabin  train station and archival vault here feels lived in  bone chillingly cold and full of surprises it s a rough haul at times  but expertly executed and entirely worthy of the anticipation leading up to its release rooney s lisbeth takes matters large and small into her own hands with a ferocious self sufficiency that leaves the audience gasping with both horror and a provocative delight not entirely undiluted with envy  likable  no  but impossible to easily dismisswhat he has delivered is adequate  but it doesn t have any flavor   and of all the things fincher is   bland  is not usually one of them david fincher s the girl with the dragon tattoo is a tense thriller that unfolds with all the twists and turns one could hope to have highly satisfying and smart thriller  which should quiet all the naysayers who might have thought this much anticipated zeitgeist remake project wholly unnecessary mara s efficient  straightforward physicality and her watchful but implacable expression are just right for the character who is about to kick the hornet s nest  even though the film boasts a list talent both in front of and behind the camera  at heart this  dragon tattoo  is pulp that s just as nasty and visceral   and entertaining   as its predecessors  immaculate style  questionable substance utterly engaging  a transporting bit of cinema that immerses viewers    uncomfortably at times    in a riveting detective story hollywood managed to not only not screw this one up  but actually made it one of the best movies of the year yet another faithful adaptation   those fortunate enough to be making salander s acquaintance for the first time will want to hold on david fincher s adaptation of the international best seller is a triumph of craftsmanship over material practically screams out that it wants to be cool  and succeeds most of the time  probably the best possible movie version of the girl with the dragon tattoo the title sequence alone is the single coolest thing you will see at the movies all year the american version of the girl with the dragon tattoo is well made  well cast  tense and exciting  i just wish i hadn t seen it all before dragon tattoo offers a handsome package built on rickety foundations  hoping to pass inspection on good looks alone the land of the midnight sun has never looked darker the problem is that even fincher can t renew the impact of larsson s original twists  unless you have an aversion to long books or subtitlesrooney  noomi i love both  dragon tattoo  girls an altogether leaner  meaner  more high powered  stylish  and deftly directed affair  though similarly hampered by a too long narrative fuse even fincher s elegantly gruesome style can t turn this swedish noir into the meditation on evil and corruption that it fancies itself to be unfortunately  fincher doesn t add much to niels arden oplev s swedish version  more googling and plot compressing montages and an altered but still convoluted ending a dark thriller that mines the meanings of family skeletons  power  corruption  sex  and misogyny i can tell you that as a virgin to the story  this version of girl with the dragon tattoo completely drew me into larsson s beautifully constructed  terrifying world provides all the jolts and forward motion that any good airport novel gives you  but it s the film equivalent of the book that kept you awake from chicago to baltimore  only you don t feel bad about leaving it on the seat next to you after you land when it comes down to it  this is rooney mara s movie  and i don t care if the second and third stories are any good as long as they are full of lisbeth salander this is what a movie adaptation should be  a film whose base narrative has its roots in the source material but whose soul can be identified through the images that unfold on screen i wanted more pizzazz and deeper  more nuanced characterizations from fincher and co   but for those who have no context regarding pervious larsson presentations this story driven procedural may be well be good enough surprisingly sanitized version of the swedish blockbuster has little resonance in this americanized form  stick with with swedish version   both book and film i don t think i ve seen an actor do more with deadpan expressions than mara does in this movie  her face doesn t move but  whether she s tasing a man or standing in front of a mirror watching a cigarette dangle from her mouth  we respond to her mara s lisbeth can be brashly young and impossibly smart  it s a performance that should well serve the upcoming sequels mara s bristling  unbridled performance gives the film the ballast it needs to pull off that curious  undeniably engrossing  balancing act the swedish version was sloppier and trashier  which suited the material  if that movie was more lurid  it also packed more genuine emotion it s stylish  if not exactly subtle  and daringly brutal for a hollywood movie  it s also so uneven and overlong that it may leave non fans wondering what all the fuss has been about the girl with the dragon tattoo is that rare hard r rated studio film that expertly weaves story and character development into the lascivious subject matter a satisfying thriller and welcome counter programming for the christmas season this is some pretty raw stuff to gift wrap under the christmas tree this holiday movie season  but it is also a great story for awards season  when adults can finally see movies for adults this dragon flies  but it never really breathes fire the kick in this material  especially in this new version which plays down mikael s surliness  is lisbeth  a pixieish polysexual outlier who seems equipped with her own portable storm cloud she s fascinating and tough     wish the film was a bit more like her  it s a warm dragon  rather than a fiery one the fincher version doesn t actively negate the presence of the earlier one   it doesn t have to   but its confidence and bravado are like a strong blast of sunlight with the ability to fade the memory of whatever came before the stellar  english language take on  the girl with the dragon tattoo  burrows so deeply into the heads of its characters that even when they re just thinking  it s deeply thrilling seeing fincher s version is like getting a christmas gift of a book you already have while it feels churlish to complain about a genre piece that s been executed with such precise craft  i have to confess that  in both versions  i ve found dragon tattoo s plot profoundly boring the dynamic between craig and mara in the girl with the dragon tattoo is so sensational  it instantly propels the movie beyond glossy  high toned pulp into something far more affecting this is an ingenious and engrossing work of pop cinema  that said  when it was over i felt a wave of ennui wash over me upon reflecting that we ve got two more of these to go the new  tattoo  is buoyed by fincher s peerless craftsmanship  never has a director been better suited to photographing winter scenes near the arctic circle a solidly crafted  creepily suspenseful thriller a visually impressive  well acted adaptation of the book  with significant differences in tone from the swedish film even those who know the torturous story by heart will be impressed by the intense focus  attention to detail and fidelity to the original material that director david fincher brings this jagged little tale fincher s electrifying storytelling makes the most of unsettling visuals  large casts  complex plots and sharp dialogue this film s cold  almost robotic conception of salander as a twitchy  anorexic waif feels more like a stunt than a complete character  and so the best part of the reason we care enough to endure all that mayhem has gone away once the hype dies  this movie will be best enjoyed as a drinking game  down a shot of absolut every time craig whips his glasses on or off and you ll be blitzed by the halfway point the film hits a nice groove in the interplay between craig and mara  together and apart  and fincher displays his usual mastery at explicating the finer points of an investigation in the incendiary performance by rooney mara  one of the year s best  you have all the incentive you need to drag out the dragon tattoo gun yet again this is never the kind of movie where they re going to fall in love  that she even smiles is a breakthrough larsson has whipped up something unique   agatha christie with techno goths   yet this is unremarkable  if anything  the mixing of elements feels clumsy this studio version is  oddly enough  far less commercial and only about a quarter as lushly mysterious as the superior overseas original  exquisitely crafted  curiously uninvolving fincher has made a movie that is not only wholly redundant in light of the original but also one that is worse than its already problematic predecessor an incredibly well executed thriller that transcends its admittedly pulpy and occasionally ridiculous source material with an extraordinary degree of technical skildaniel craig and rooney mara are fine in the leads  but when it comes to the actual plot  one does get the feeling that it didn t need to be told again  newcomers to the story may disagree a rarity in that it is an improvement over the swedish language original  this intricately woven  edge of your seat whodunit is as graphic and grisly as it is cerebral and mind bending  projects and directors are rarely better matched than the girl with the dragon tattoo and david fincher dragon tattoo  knows precisely how to achieve its look  rhythm  sound and spirit  it s extremely well made by a genuine and reliable talent  but i thought he was done with this sort of thing not too surprisingly  fincher doesn t bring his auteur a game here  though his crafty b game is better than most with great pizzazz  fincher s creative team s original style wrings suspense from the aspects that are a pastiche of other thrillers fincher pushes the tale of serial killing to the blackest depths of noir depravity there s powerful craft here  and larsson s story has more than proven its ability to grip mr  fincher s impressive skill is evident  even as his ambitions seem to be checked by the limitations of the source material and the imperatives of commercial entertainment justifies its existence by improving on niels arden oplev s serviceable but unspectacular swedish predecessor  though it can t overcome the flaws of the original book i m not sure i ve seen a more superfluous film that fincher s pointless second take on a story that was served supremely well onscreen so recently   mara s performance has a ferocity that will linger in your mind long after the two or three endings have faded throbs as a tale of good people wanting to right wrongs with the truth if possible  and violence if necessary i m not impugning fincher s intentions  i m just saying that  as good as his film may be  it s redundant and unnecessary  a tough  post punk tintin meets klute for the occupy wall street set  this kinetic  hard edged thriller is the perfect festive comedown for fincher fans and dysfunctional families everywhere  fincher  never abandons his meticulousness    it s what allows him to position you in the exact right spot to deliver the blow  despite the riveting lisbeth reinvention and fincher s visual prowess  source material problems remain in the form of creepy sexual politics and patchwork storytelling by focusing on the strongest part of the best selling novels  david fincher and steve zallian have delivered a stylish  mesmerizing thriller  david fincher s first rate direction effortlessly wipes the floor with the soporific swedish counterpart  in the end  though  even fincher can t froth up some of the novel s more procedural killer of the week fancies in less experienced hands  this would surely have wound up as lurid  trashy pulp  yet fincher plays it straight and keeps it serious ultimately it s mara who has to pull it off and deliver lisbeth s unique brand of cunning and power fueled by revenge  she s a knockout hypnotic at times  masterfully evoking locations and blurred headspace through precise imagery    pure silver screen math  fincher respects the clue gobbling tonality of the story  but he also keeps his directorial fingerprint fresh a mesmerizing movie that veers towards an unbearably tense climax  the girl with the dragon tattoo benefits from invigorating direction and superb acting that allows the old fashioned mystery to unravel in a hugely satisfying and captivating way every decision made here  from how the novel was refined to the controversial casting of rooney mara to one of the best technical teams of the year was the right one david fincher s american version of the girl with the dragon tattoo is a powerhouse of a picture  and  in an incredible feat  rooney mara wrests the role away from the unforgettable noomi rapace in the swedish version    mara and fincher make it her own the great screenwriter steven zaillian s elaborate  convoluted script  so muddled that even after it s over you still don t know what it s all about  is a drawback    but the movie is a master class in sinister style  tense and deeply uncomfortable  video  david fincher can do a great re make  now  let s hope he never does one again  though fincher hits all the right emotional beats and does all the memorable set pieces  his exquisite craft can t distract from a number of troubling questions at the story s core crisp  stylish and well acted english language adaptation  rooney mara rocks this role fans of the book and film should rest easy at how this  dragon tattoo  is still inherently a swedish tale   set and partly shot in sweden   and fincher doesn t flinch from the sexual violence at their core fincher fires on all cylinders to save this story from itself  exhibiting the propulsive energy of fight club and the storytelling mastery of zodiac and the social network  fincher  has made the girl with the dragon tattoo into an electrifying movie by turning the audience into addicts of the forbidden  looking for the sick and twisted things we can t see it s easy to see why david fincher wanted to make it  but hard to shake the feeling that perhaps he shouldn t have bothered craig is an anchor of cool rationality and judiciousness around which mara revolves like a demon changed ending aside  fincher s take is as faithful as it is fearless  and mara rocks yep  that s  the girl with the dragon tattoo fincher synthesizes the best of both of his two previous serial killer movies  but combines them with a maturity that shouldn t be mistaken for boredom with the material  david fincher s much anticipated return to serial killer territory is a fastidiously grim pulp entertainment that plays like a first class train ride through progressively bleaker circles of hell fine american version of the literary sensation delivers everything except that something extra this darker  slicker and more humane re telling of swedish crime thriller the girl with the dragon tattoo improves upon previous adaptations  thanks to david fincher s vast skills as a master of dark suspense  monstrously skillful and powerfully engrossing  this is a taut thriller that sadly overstays its welcome with an extended finale that isn t nearly as satisfying turns out  fincher was right all along  rooney mara is a perfect salander  her performance  combined with the reznor ross score  makes this a perfect adaptation of stieg larsson s entertaining novel  a must see     a good enough thriller with fine production values  but it s not top notch fincher  where it should have shrieked and howled it only occasionally rattles the windows subpar material gets a tonal and aesthetic   and  by extension  thematic   boost from directorial virtuosity in david fincher s american remake you ll be happier with the film if you don t expect fidelity to source material  but that doesn t mean you ll hate it if you loved niels arden oplev s movie as played by mara  lisbeth is the ultimate badass  a formidable force of hyperintellect and raging sexuality      if you love these books  then consider this a christmas present a bracing and completely absorbing thriller the most handsome funeral procession ever mounted  which is  in the end  better than feeling like you re the corpse lying inside the coffin this is a bleak but mesmerizing piece of filmmaking  it offers a glancing  chilled view of a world in which brief moments of loyalty flicker between repeated acts of betrayal hollywood s motivation for trying to cash in on a hot title is clear  it s not so easy to divine  david  fincher s reasons for signing on schwarzenegger is never going to make the de niros and hoffmans of this world lose a night s sleep  but he has acquired a new confidence as an actor under verhoeven s guidance total recall is slick  sly and subversive  and if some of the special effects have aged somewhat  that only adds to the charm all told  total recall is a powerful brew of mordant humor  keen wit  refreshing originality and graphic violence as quaid  schwarzenegger continues to stretch beyond his reach as an actor  relying on physical prowess to keep him in character total recall went through four directors before verhoeven finally took it on  and four writers worked on the script  it s no wonder the finished film emerges without a unifying style  or a single performance worth mentioning if the movie sometimes seems overwhelmed by its budget and its legendary third act problems  it s still entertainingly raw and brutal  full of whiplash pace and juicy exaggeration if total recall isn t as much fun as i d hoped  it s not as dreary as i d feared  i wouldn t call it totally awesome  but it s far from being a total loss the movie is a cartoon  though a mammothly enjoyable one this rip roaring slice of sci fi excess remains arnold schwarzenegger s most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit  the terminator arnold schwarzenegger brings an effective blend of machismo and innocence to his role  too bad director paul verhoeven lets brainless violence and tricky special effects swamp the cleverness of the tale itself total recall begins to self destruct not long after schwarzenegger arrives on mars  and the story degenerates into a violent  stunningly foul mouthed enterprise if you don t ask too many questions  or just accept that it s all a dream so logic and science don t matter  then this is an enjoyable romp paul verhoeven s version of the original story packs a real sense of intellect and brilliant ambiguity beneath the seemingly surface science fiction action tale   a wickedly violent  action packed old school piece of warped  twist filled sci fi and schwarzenegger cheese  you ll wish you had three hands to hold this one total recall s caricaturing of schwarzenegger  its flip ribbing at his stocks of action hero cache  signal the deep  almost atomic level at which its satire functions  when the leader of the rebels turns out to be baby herman from who framed roger rabbit  it s clear that the satirical bull s eyes verhoeven nailed in robocop have here been turned into a more benign state of rib nudging verhoeven s version of philip dick s story is vigorous  exciting  and inventive sci fi thriller  combining pulp savviness  ultra graphic violence  and oscar winning special effects it s still a guilty pleasure   though the guilt quotient is a bit higher   and that s down to the still extraordinary presence of the massively gym built arnold   still a ripsnorting yarn with lashings of sex and violence that hasn t aged a day overall  the movie s imaginative effects and ideas win the day an absolutely superb sci fi film and a true modern cornerstone of the genre not seen since the deeper though less entertaining blade runner nearly ten years previous total recall is too much    but it s too much of a good thing total recall is fine entertainment  complete with breathtaking action sequences and special effects that impress even in these computer generated times the fierce and unrelenting pace  accompanied by a tongue in cheek strain of humor in the roughhouse screenplay  keeps the film moving like a juggernaut ugly  stupid  loud  offensive  and pointlessly violent a worthy entry in the dystopian cycle launched by blade runner  this seems less derivative than most of its predecessors yet equally accomplished in its straight ahead storytelling  with plenty of provocative satiric undertones and scenic details say what you will about verhoeven s penchant for extravagant theatrics  when he s not yanking the arms off people or putting bullets in their forehead  he tells a good story the future doesn t come any better    people are allowed to change their mindsoh for the days when verhoeven was still in holland mediocre sci fi  gained a cult following  for some unknown reason melding the ever more workable schwarzenegger mystique with a better than average science fiction premise  the director paul verhoeven has come up with a vigorous  superviolent interplanetary thriller that packs in wallops with metronomic regularity while it may seem dated today  the film showcases sharon stone  evil wife to schwarzenegger  you may want to take notice of how precious air is after seeing it this is a very interesting film and is also successful as a headlong roller coaster ride of a pure action film this futuristic science fiction is based on a philip k  dick short story  and features award winning special effects a cheerfully reprehensible bloodfest  spiced up by verhoeven s imaginative mayhem mindless  harmless popcorn flick  emphasis on the mindless mind bending psychodrama watching it now especially  it seems even more ahead of its time with it s altered reality storyline ridiculous  but also plenty of funperhaps it goes without saying that total recall is no the terminator  but let the records show arnold schwarzenegger is a fool to think he ll make it as the johnny carson of action films worryingly satisfying in a purely gruesome  beat em up kinda way neither arnold schwarzenegger nor paul verhoeven have stretched their talents here there may be people who overlook the arnold schwarzenegger performance in total recall who think he isn t really acting  but the performance is one of the reasons the movie works so well a gratuitous explosion of vainglory and guts  the movie is all firecrackers and giblets and broken glass  the overall effect is like wading through hospital waste schwarzenegger has enough inherent charm and likeability that he s better off when he just lets the story pull him along  as he does here until director paul verhoeven allows the violence to reach the berserk level  arnold schwarzenegger and a spectacular special effects team seem on their way to a futuristic classic verhoeven keeps the whole thing chugging along neatly with a huge dollop of ultra violence and gore  schwarzenegger is at his best ever it should please pretty much anyone who likes science fiction films  it should have a broad range of appeal on many levels  a  well paced  entertaining and thought provoking piece of science fiction cinema  a truly superb  yet disregarded gem of that particular genre nannannannannannannanthere s just a gripping story and a tremendously talented cast  craig takes bond seriously  and he s a pleasure to watch the film makes bond feel relevant and new without forgetting what made those old bond films work it doesn t celebrate the glamorous lifestyle of a dashing spy so much as it makes you worry about him and his ma am bond can be forever reinvented  reinterpreted  updated  and as skyfall is showing  he s more popular than ever the theme of skyfall is that the world must remain safe for white englishmen to run around shooting people who aren t white and english what ultimately hobbles skyfall is its dramatic imbalance at both macro and micro levels this is a gorgeous film to look at  and a highly entertaining one to watch a stirring addition to the james bond franchise britain is quite diverse right now  feel free to reflect that anytime  mr  bond james bond has been relegated to cinematic stupidity before  but demoting the character to this degree of slightness is even more deflating skyfall gets off to a fast start  i can t recall when i ve enjoyed a pre title sequence more  it achieves an effective balance between the ever escalating action sequences that each successive bond picture apparently demands  fresh use of charismatic talent  and nods to the legacyskyfall elevates the bond genre to a new level of a list refinement  but it s a game changing movie in more ways than one mendes and deakins have  created the most beautifully deep focus context for bond yet  pushing and pulling him into landscapes    that each promise the physically compromised spy nothing less than the most cinematically gorgeous sort of doom urbane yet never too serious  and beautifully shot by roger deakins  this all seems a good fit for director sam mendes  who s made his career imposing a sort of british pretense on american movies a bond film should feature a menacing villain who s also just a touch daffy  javier bardem has more fun than anybody else onscreen as a rogue agent with a mommy complex and a come hither leer everything is heavy and dark  but bond plus terrorists is damn entertaining it stands up with the finest work that deakins has ever done  which pretty much means that it s as gorgeous as film gets skyfall acts as though every new james bond adventure needs to earn our belief that he still matters  and that a secret agent with a soul can be just as compelling as an exploding pen it seems engineered to please fans old and new  and tells a clever    but not too clever    story with wry humor  well conceived action sequences and depth and meaning for the character it s certainly smarter than the last few bonds that have zipped in and out of the viewer s mind  the impact of this espionage adventure lasts after it has ended if casino royale changed the dynamics of bond  skyfall s cemented them locationwise  there is stunning photography of shanghai and the wilds of scotland by veteran roger deakins this is the true reboot of the franchise  the film in which  three movies into his tenure  daniel craig becomes the best james bond there ever was expertly shot by the unlikely genius roger deakins    who does spectacular work in the film s shanghai chapter    skyfall is one of those movie movies that manages to impress you with its heft most bond films have flaws but few bond films end up as enjoyable as this make no mistake about it  bond is back on top form  and won t be hanging up his tuxedo yet skyfall is the kind of film that makes it easy to love bond the way you probably did as a kid it s never dull  occasionally surprising and unafraid to delve into bond s life more than any film since on her majesty s secret service  unfortunately  all of that comes at the price of gaping plot holes and staggering lapses in logic skyfall is not simply one of the very best bond films  it s one of the year s best movies  period from the very first shot of skyfall  it s clear that this isn t just another james bond movie skyfall is the smartest bond film for many years  and though aficionados will enjoy the many nods to past films  this is a film that sets out a future path for bond you leave the theatre thinking less of the spectacular action and instead ponder the complex heart and soul that make james bond such an indelible and truly iconic figure  this spectacularly entertaining epic takes several risks and yet  nevertheless  pays off splendidly skyfall is indeed the best bond film ever  and maybe even better than that as the james bond film franchise continues to get a vigorous shaking  consider this critic sufficiently stirred at times skyfall is simply sensational during it all  bond and m indulge in enough soul searching conversations to create a real personal drama  and that alone might make this a different and  in some ways  better bond film if a bond movie is essentially a string of sequences  skyfall s contributions delight this latest installment  which firmly cements daniel craig as one of the best bonds ever  feels more serious  less gimmicky  more geared towards mature adults all we can reasonably be sure of what they ve been telling us since from russia with love  james bond will return  he s welcome back any time some bond films show their age  not skyfall  it s super sky high entertainment and brimming with excitement craig has relaxed into bond without losing any steeliness as an attempt to fill in bond as a character  rather than just make the same film over  mendes has succeeded  i think one of the year s most crackling adventure films  one of bond s most satisfying outings  and proof that you can indeed teach an old horndog new tricks in a late year picture that ordinary moviegoers really cared about  with good reason  judi dench s m rivaled daniel craig s james bond in screen time and easily outdid him in complexity of motive in sam mendes s first bond movie  dazzlingly photographed by roger deakins  the sequences shot in wintry london and scotland stand out the franchise s signature elaborate action sequences are fewer and shorter  making for a more intimate  personal story director sam mendes can t decide if he s shooting a chilly noir or a roger moore camp classic visual elements draw from a theatrical vocabulary  such as a besorrowed m overlooking gray london at a window slashed with billions of cold tears  match cut to wounded bond cascading over a waterfall like a spent package it s not just a terrific bond movie  it s a terrific movie  period  mendes has embraced the general super ness of bond and taken his inspiration from the best superhero flick of recent years  the dark knight one of the better bonds  but it isn t as good as daniel craig s first outing solicits swoons like the best bonds ever did  even if bond s dangerously close to decommission a very british bond  and also a very personal one  sam mendes revitalizes the james bond franchise with a slick and action packed entry  daniel craig proves yet again why he s the best bond yet bond traditions haven t just been updated    they ve been intelligently modified and rethought  giving us the franchise s inherent pleasures in a new package skyfall proves that a long standing series can deliver the expected fundamentals while keeping the new films fresh and unpredictable it s been a long time since i enjoyed a bond movie so much it s a pity fleming never lived to see craig s hyper masculine yet vulnerable bond  he s well on his way to being the best of them all skyfall epitomizes what a bond movie should be  and its director  for once  justifiably deserves much of the credit james bond looks broken and weary  an embodiment of a traditional model of international spydom  the one premised on national borders  white western wealthy entitlements  and excessive consumptions of alcohol  cars  and women i have no compulsion whatsoever in declaring skyfall  in terms of cinematography  the best looking bond film ever     action movies simply don t look like this   but     this is no ordinary action movie sentimental touches underscore the fun and frivolity of bond s past while relishing the brutal landscape of the modern day super spy sam mendes has done a magnificent job  creating both a relevant and timeless entry into the bond canon  while deftly adding homages to the series  past    tough and grim but still spry     feels like something of a rearguard action in the case of the british empire sometimes the old ways are the best  this is a theme and repeated line running throughout the new james bond film skyfall and never has it been more true not the best bond movie ever but a very good one  a little darker but still unsettled as to what type overall it wants to be too often this martini is sloppy  not smooth skyfall is not  of course    darker   or more serious than previous bond films  but it s more knowing about its own conventions fabulous entertainment breathes fresh life into the genre a lot of critics are claiming this to be the best bond film ever made  they may well be right to some degree  it s certainly the most poignant which  in what is ostensibly an action film  is a feather in mendes  cap to be sure  suffers from unconvincing plotting  and a third act so bad it brings the roof of the whole endeavour caving ineven die hard sean connery fans will have to admit there s another actor who can portray james bond when they see  skyfall  mendes does a superb job maintaining tension   and releasing it from time to time so we can take a breath  have a laugh  sit back from the edge of our seat   as he shows how seriously the james bond character can be taken  without breaking itskyfall is inconsistent  displaying bond at its blandest and bond at its best best   bond   ever sweeping action  solid characters  spectacular scenery  a bountiful sense of cleverness  and a pitch perfect tone of self reference to the long line of bond pop culture mythology  mendes and co  has an astutely cunning way to keep our blood pumping every minute of the latest and  arguably  best time we ve had with the enduring bond in years better than the average bond  but not the greatest a crackerjack bond film that cannily mixes the harder  more severe edges of the previous craig films with a sly sense of humorthe latest james bond adventure proves  at least in my opinion  that craig has grasped the role better than any of his predecessors  including sean connery skyfall succeeds in providing epic escapism with just the right balance of action  art house aesthetics and melodrama  i had more fun with it than i didn t  which is more than i can say about a lot of these big budget event movies  quantum of solace   was a dour  dire letdown  this picture s a substantial bounce back  and easily the best craig bond picture  emotional depth and all bardem s silva and the spectacular image making breathe new life into the old firm  bond age has rarely been so much fun this is a strong  fast  and sexy action story that gives us something different from the bond films we have seen before while  the film  gets more emotional and resonant as it goes on  it also gets much slower and narrower in scope traveling the world  solving a mystery  hunting people down  killing some of those people   everything that you want james bond to do  then it takes an interesting turn skyfall might stand as the lone example of a satisfying  standalone narrative blending with all those tried and true bond tropes  adele tune aside  mendes makes nary a misstep    just as marc forster went off the rails in quantum of solace during that silly horse race juxtaposition  so too does mendes go overboard with the deconstruction dysfunction  nothing like a good villiani wanted to like skyfall more than i did  which is funny because after the opening sequence  i felt sure i would love it in more ways than one  bond is back this is one of the better bond films in the franchise a key aspect of any movie is how quickly it can reel you in  in the case of skyfall  this box is ticked in the opening few minutes never a better villain than bardem  blonde and mincing with a scathingly brilliant intellect at the service of a twisted  raging mother complex  and there has not been a better mother complex in film since psychoskyfall returns bond to solid groundit s an old fashioned bond movie  or at least promises the next one will be  and that s good news for many a bloated  tedious  uninspired  sluggish and vapid bore that can only be enjoyed by very shallow  unctuous philistines who pays the price for skyfall  bond fans do  of course  but so does daniel craig  he s not going to be around forever   not in this shape  anyway     the best looking bond movie ever made  roger deakins  cinematography is full of striking silhouettes  some stark and simple as woodcuts  others multi layered and illusory tough and taciturn  craig has re energized the franchise after the shaky brosnan years  definitely demonstrating that the series has once again earned its license to thrill skyfall may not be another casino royale  but it ranks higher than almost anything else the franchise has had to offer for over a decade  what mendes delivers is a mixed blessing  a bond film so self serious it condescends to the frivolities it pretends to honor skyfall is a great movie  it s a welcome sight to see it bring the franchise into modern filmmaking an espionage thriller mixed with a revenge story wrapped in a character study about the world s favorite secret agent old and new  skyfall follows the well worn patterns of its predecessorsdoes bond still have it the franchise has refashioned itself by never once forgetting its glorious history  including a certain  goldfinger  car among the most ambitious imaginings of bond to date  dark  supple  and punctuated with moments of unanticipated visual brilliance     a combination of the old and the new  the predictable and the completely unexpected now with skyfall the sweet spot is back  the movie unspools as a thrilling action flick packed with witty little touches that bond fans will recognize as big  fat valentines to the franchise s past is skyfall the best bond film yet  no  is it a smart and engaging bond film  absolutely skyfall returns to basics  the plot and economical but riveting action sequences are secondary to the film s cinematography  direction  acting and writing mendes  approach to action is classical and elegant   no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here   but what makes the movie special is the attention he pays his actors  bond returns for more racy  action packed thrills the opening sequence is very bond esque  but the film itself is way too long  and actually tedious halfway through  while it is a typically ambitious james bond venture  the movie is far too long  ninety five minutes would have been fine  but for my money  there isn t anything else bond can do to thrill movie audiences  it is time to retire a sly  deconstructionist approach to bond combined with a climactic sequence that is hands down the best  most gorgeously shot  and most breathtakingly thrilling in the franchise s history make this one of the most satisfying and well made entries when the credits declare  as they traditionally do  that  james bond will return   you ll be eager for that return to come as soon as possible skyfall is visually impressive from beginning to end  offers what feels like the closing of one exciting bond chapter and the opening of another  and features some of the most blood pumping action sequences of the daniel craig bond films skyfall  is thrilling  it s funny  it s moving and it s the one thing that james bond movies never  ever used to be   surprising  so skyfall may not be the film you are expecting from the franchise but it s a film that will prove more satisfying with each viewing daring to broach the subject of how dated the characters and the series are  daniel craig  judi dench and director sam mendes make one of the best bond s of all  if this proves to be a transitional film  let it be as an introduction to an agent who comes back with his sense of humor intact  this sensitive new bond world is really not enough quibble here and there over a sequence or a subplot that occasionally drifts off course from skyfall s narrowly focused story  but this is a film that roars with enthusiasm  guts  and a sense of freedom from genre conventions the whole franchise has been given a new shot of vitality and vigor its canny blend of ingredients is sure to entertain any audience but i think bond enthusiasts will relish it most  as it draws on our familiarity with the series  many touchstones one of the best bond movie ever  this thriller offers up great action sequences and a smart dialogue  this is a movie that raises the question of bond s origins in a way we ve never seen  yes  skyfall really is as great as you ve been hearing the last scenes reshuffle the deck with a tipped cap to tradition and a clear eye on the future  they suggest bond has learned all he must to persevere  perhaps he can go forth defined less by those he s lost and have a little fun in doing so in the span of three films craig has made the character his ownit s a fine action film  i just wish i could say it was more fun skyfall  is a different kind of bond movie  one that works just fine on its own terms  but a steady diet of this might kill the franchise  one  skyfall  is enough great heroes are often enhanced by the villains they face  and such is the situation here  to really work  bond needs great bad guys  silva is bad at its best    because of all the mindless action  it s ok as an entertainment even though it s much darker and devoid of the bon mots that highlighted most bond films skyfall leaves you wondering whether this incarnation of the character has anywhere left to go  it s the portrait of a spy at the end of his rope by an actor who seems close to his the movie s smartest suit is emotional intelligence  skyfall keeps us caring  intensely  for a hero who  by any rational measure  is a vestige of a vanished era this is the movie in which the newest bond finally eases into the part of the bon vivant for queen and country horndog who likes his martinis shaken and not stirred the director  sam mendes  has taken a pop concept and solemnized it with freud  which is not  perhaps  the best way of turning bond into grownup entertainment craig has settled into a well suited  grim reaper role  even when james flirts and trysts  his creased face suggests an unmovable weight this is it    this is james bond in all of his glory    in what easily ranks up there with the best bond films of them all there s a gritty  real world feel to skyfall that makes good use of craig s down to earthiness one of the best bond pictures ever   a satisfying blend of the old and the new skyfall is a rollicking good bond and daniel craig s best craig s working class  grim bond is compelling  and  skyfall  tries to give  in its third act  some insight into how he got that way after all the hopes that i had for this film being the return to greatness for the franchise  i am sad to report that bond has once again misfired this is a smashing entertainment  but also one that feels over engineered and constrained by its origins while  skyfall  obviously has a great fondness for the past  it s not trapped there  it also anticipates bond s future  in this immensely satisfying movie  so do we a disappointing james bond thriller despite a lack of complexity   skyfall  is a respectable chapter in the bond saga skyfall  may be the most intimate bond film yet the new bond thrills but falls short of greatness what propels this grisly chapter is the characters  keen sense of agency noted killjoy sam mendes might seem like a counterintuitive addition to the series  but it turns out he s aces with action staging and set pieces soaked in local flavor the filmmakers expertly balance historical homages and modern action craig s most effective bond movie yet fueled as much by daniel craig s vulnerable portrayal of bond as its crisp action sequences  mendes offers a rock solid entry in the long running franchise this is bond like you ve never seen him and a dynamite daniel craig  never better in the role  nails bond s ferocity and feeling  skyfall is smashing  just smashing skyfall is as satisfying as a great martini bond  james bond is back daniel craig s greatest bond adventure yet    a shining example of what can be achieved when you combine blockbuster filmmaking with prestige talent with spectacular action sequences  a rock solid star and a ration of cheese that s good english cheddar   skyfall  is a gift from above it s a modern twist on a classic series and just when you might be wondering about yet another iconic bond element   bingo  the filmmakers deliver with an ending that leaves you wanting more sam mendes adds freshness in this smart  character driven film  as middle aged bond thrives in today s terror ridden world  still loaded with action  the best bond in years  james bond goes home in every sense in this ravishingly entertaining entry in the series  five decades later  it all of a sudden feels fresh  fun  and utterly engaging  as much as casino royale felt like a game changer six years ago  skyfall moves the ball further down the field  it is both grander and grimmer  a clear and unequivocal improvement over the reprehensible quantum of solace   gets bond back to the basics  bullets  babes  big time bad guys and bawdy humor from the first smoky notes of a theme song sung by adele  it s clear that  skyfall  will be both classic and of the moment it s a terrific movie that will work just as well for bond fans and bond newbies skyfall doesn t forget it has to be an exciting spy film above all  but from its first scene  it ratchets up the drama in ways that have little to do with action this is a full blooded  joyous  intelligent celebration of a beloved cultural icon  with daniel craig taking full possession of a role he previously played unconvincingly playful   the most conspicuously repeated word is  game   the most dangerous of which bond typically is  pursues  or plays skyfall is an awesome james bond movie until it gets tired of all that  goes a little crazy and turns into a not so awesome home alone movie  this is perhaps the most visually stunning bond movie ever made  too self serious for its own good and attempts at giving it a lighter edge fall flat  but there is the suggestion at the end that this new  remodeled bond is still only getting started the movie makes a claim that can t be matched by many bond films  it s actually about something skyfall s fatal misstep is its slavish hewing to event movie trends in  skyfall   mendes has given us a thrilling new chapter in a franchise that by all rights should have been gasping for air   which really makes him the hero of this saga  mendes  and screenwriters neal purvis  robert wade and john logan have managed what feels like the best possible thing that could have happened to bond  they ve made him fun again we get the gadgets  the nods to previous bond films  the martinis and all but  skyfall  succeeds by not resting on its veritable history but by adding more depth to the celebrated franchise skyfall is easily one of the best films in the series    a cracking thriller molded to a shrewd study of bond and his domain the best of craig s adventures  a superbly mounted  clear headed adventure with enough delicious oddity and exhilaration to help forget there ever was a quantum of solace mendes distills the bond ethos in a single sequence  it s sex and death as irresistible surface and sheen skyfall stands out by bringing bond into a real world milieu  for many reasons  things aren t so comfortable and secure anymore whether mr  mendes is deploying an explosion or a delectable detail  he retains a crucially human scale and intimacy  largely by foregrounding the performers more than anything  skyfall is about the bond girls  they ve come a long way  baby  fully formed  strong thinking  and smart  pivotal characters  skyfall focuses firmly on m  and rookie eve some of it is terrific  and some of it is spectacular take the plunge  bond is back  and so is high octane entertainment i m happy to report that bond is back  and he s bad  and that s good the stripped down  slightly grittier feel of the movie carries us along   and  perhaps  even announces a direction for the series that s both new to young fans and as old as  from russia with love with stunning cinematography from roger deakins  a stirring music score by thomas newman and another charismatic villain from bardem  skyfall ranks as one of the best bonds yet outlandishly ambitious  this sure footed re boot isn t just among the best of the bond series  but among the best movies of the year the best bond movie in decades bardem s silva is a throwback to a more traditional bond villain  with equal parts creepy sensuality  intelligence  and psychopathy  and a touch of physical deformity for good measure this is a brilliant reboot of the canon  mixing a sense of melancholy  the shock of changing times and the darkness of loss with thrillingly staged chase and fight scenes and clever references to all that has come before skyfall has the feel of both a ceremonial commemoration and a franchise rebooting celebration    skyfall can take its place alongside from russia with love  goldfinger  and on her majesty s secret service as the best bond can offer mendes and deakins are so busy trying to be visionary that they don t notice that characters are wandering too far from their roots  and half the time you can t see what s going on these are truly tedious stakes for an action movie  the franchise isn t worried about world safety  it s fretting over whether to start wearing depends this is bond as interpreted by the british director sam mendes and shot by the renowned cinematographer roger deakins  and one of the first things that strike you is how sumptuous it looks casino royale remains the best of the recent bonds  with skyfall just a notch below it a super suave but softer bond  with craig barely wrinkling his gorgeous suits  bardem  as a dandyish villain  works up a good  greasy sweat skyfall  is so good you almost forget it is a james bond movie with the onset of the sublime skyfall  daniel craig officially wrests the title of  best bond ever  from connery  the british bulldog delivers a brilliant  bulldozing performance in a cinematic spectacular more streamlined than one of his tom ford suits a series that gloried in wit  irony and sex has been reduced to a generic spy thriller the emphasis here is on the human factor   this is a movie that s as much about what happens between the action as the action itself skyfall represents the new standard in one of cinema s longest running franchises  it is a deeply personal  exquisitely shot film that had me mesmerized from the opening scene parental figures and familial legacy are central to the importance and impact of sam mendes  story and ian fleming s stylish protagonist becomes a more real but no less exciting figure because of it aptly demonstrates you can have a blockbuster of thematic depth and emotional significance that is still loads of fun better brace yourself for the best bond episode in ages  thanks to daniel craig s coming of age to make the role his own skyfall has everything you love about bond from yesteryear  and infuses the modern elements that resuscitated the character a new bond film  we are assured in the closing credits  is on its way    skyfall provides reasons to look forward to more thrilling  sexy  and beautifully photographed conveys the melancholy of loss  mortality  and future shock anxiety  while at the same time leaving us plenty of space to enjoy one of the most complexly unhinged villains in bond history not only one of the best james bond movies in the five decade history of the beloved character but it s one of the best action movies of the last decade  the best bond film since i don t know what     never less than gripping few things get better with age  among the things that do  a good scotch and  in his latest incarnation  bond    james bond craig manages to get out of the shadow of connery skyfall abounds with bum notes and unfortunate compromises  but mendes has found many fresh things to do with this dusty old machine skyfall doesn t have the layers it needs to strut so casually for so long  bond s latest is a remarkable high watermark for the series  at once solemn and deeply funny  sexy and sad  self conscious without all the rib bruising elbowing bond really is back mendes wants to combine a bourne like lack of quips and frippery with christopher nolan ish solemnity and gigantism    skyfall is a brilliant bond mendes and his team have done an extremely canny job of combining old school bond with new innovations  showing respect for the series  heritage while also delivering some audacious surprises     director sam mendes manages to pay sophisticated  sincere homage to the conventions that define the bond series while remembering that one of the things that makes the series such an enduring presence is fun it s exhilarating  in a violent sort of way  it s witty  and it s completely engaging  one hell of an action movie  but yes  its goals are high enough  and perhaps even misguided enough  that meeting them may create some potential problems for the franchise squint at skyfall and you ll swear you re watching bruce wayneevery time a bond fan extols the virtues of the bond films i wish i could see what they saw  i finally have  and i saw it in skyfall overall  skyfall is an accomplished action movie which allows bond a little more psychological complexity and stronger emotional beats  while skyfall might explore the past  its real success is in looking to the future  the movie promises that james bond will return  and  as a result  the whole franchise feels re energized  relevant and ready for action enthralling  explosive and often very funny  skyfall doesn t just exceed expectations but shatters them nothing can beat a landmark  classic james bond picture  they don t come around all that often  the real question is not if  but when  you should see this film  and the answer would be as soon as physically possible   before somebody spoils the twist   it won t diminish sam mendes  extraordinary achievement to say that those wanting a bond film by way of christopher nolan shan t be disappointed  the pleasure is all ours  james the daniel craig era comes of age with a ballsy bond that takes brave chances and bold risks  guess what  turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks for all the pre release chatter of skyfall being  bond with a capital b   steeped in  a magical goldfinger feel   it s a film that fights surprisingly shy of the franchise s time honoured rites by keeping the plot relatively simple  mendes has given himself room to expand the characters  lend them a certain depth and just have a bit of fun a bond movie that boldly struts forward while looking back over its shoulder to the past mendes s film certainly stands out  and there s a sense that things may be slightly different from now on  this is no reboot  more a recalibration of the format  or perhaps even  as bond himself deftly puts it   a resurrection  it s premium bond if not a full blown triumph  this is certainly one of the best bonds in recent memory the new outlook  fresh cast and leaner chassis suggest that the franchise can really kick on from here  but it s hard not to feel that skyfall itself is something of a missed opportunity  better luck next time  james  again it s outlandish fun  dramatic and exciting  too   pure entertainment with a capital e pointedly eschews the spy gadgetry of earlier bond films to focus on human circuitry skyfall could be the most enjoyable bond yet  one thing s for certain  bond has never scrubbed up better  tom ford now exists to make daniel craig suits the bond movie every james bond fan  new or old  will want to see skyfall is still a vast improvement on quantum of solace  but it s no casino royale skyfall isn t just a great bond film  it s the character s resurrection feels more seriously connected to real world concerns than any previous entry  despite the usual outlandish action scenes  glittering settings and larger than life characters thrilling opening sequence with implausible feats of derringdo  check  scenery chewing psychopathic villain  check works terrifically well up to a point skyfall shakes together familiar elements of the ian fleming canon   the cars  the guns  the exotic locales with the dames to match   into a blistering comic book escapade that the old bond  and one suspects fleming too  would find altogether alien undoubtedly daniel craig s best outing  this is a new kind of bond film    has half the racing scenes  twice the plot and none of the vin diesel loads up on colors  cars and characters to distract from what s missing under the creative hood  yet this spirited sequel is fun as it rarely takes itself too seriously death by sequel  extremely violent sequel the philosophy here is when you can t make high art  make high trash    ultimately doesn t fare as well as its mediocre predecessor   i d go so far as to say that if you really liked this film  you have a career working in fast food to look forward to  get it  fast food     it provides enough sexy rides  blacktop fury  screeching hairpin turns and crashes to keep the celluloid humming    this is not a movie about people  it s about cars going very  very fast it s all curiously rote  though  the cars go really fast  and then  for a change  they go really  really fast just because you give an old car a new paint job doesn t mean it runs better whatever charms the first one had  the sequel badly misses the diesel injection the film relies on kinetic energy as its entertainment hook  there is plenty of action  no doubt  but hardly any of it inventive the movie is not going to bring many new fans to the following  but hey    it gots colour  speed and sparks its engines without attitude approach isn t just boring  it establishes singleton as the anti walter hill if you feel the need for speed in john singleton s sluggish sequel to the fast and the furious then remember  just say no if the souped up  day glo cars could have driven themselves  the movie could easily have done without the actors singleton s movie is as ingenious as a cop in a car chase movie not a good movie or a consistently solid action flick  but it is a big step up  i guess that s not much of a compliment considering what it is an improvement over  but take it for what it s worth     the quintessence of the mainstream summer sequel  loud  slick  preposterous and thoroughly disposable  where any potentially damaging sugar of invention is quickly  safely flushed out of its engine so the machinery of manipulation and the law of dimina genuine guilty pleasure director john singleton once promised greatness with boyz n the hood  here he s going through the paces with a story that was old by the second season of miami vice walker and tyrese go for a no frills style  giving the antiheroic protagonists solid emotional underpinnings before all the fancy driving gets started a feature length demolition derby custom made for members of madd   moviegoers with attention deficit disorder like smokey and the bandit for a younger  more fly  urban generation about as anachronistic and generic as an action sequel could be worth seeing only if you ve seen all the better movies now in release a summer movie that offers sporadic thrills and spills with nothing but dead air surrounding them it s about as lightweight as a cars and crime action movie should be it makes you wonder if this trip was really necessary singleton s  baby boy  discovery  tyrese  steps on the gas and leaves former star diesel in the dust where s roger corman when you need him a disappointing step downward     betraying what simple vision the original film had it s a terrible movie  stuck in plot idiocies and big  noisy set pieces like a tire mired in mud never title a movie the same way a junior high girl signs her yearbook a fun enough ambiguously gay carsploitation flick even though it s instantly forgettable this john singleton directed sequel provides a breezy enough joyride but it lacks the unassuming freshness of the economy priced original just another retread how could we possibly reconnect with the primal urges of speed demon street racers  without vin s din  the answer  in two words  vroom  vroom superficial  you betcha  but eye candy  attitude and humor abound in what amounts to a glorified miami vice episode complete with an undercover lawman who lives aboard a boat nothing says summer film fun like explosions  guns and cartwheeling cars    and that s all here it s fun  that s all the pic is closer to the playstation experience of gran turismo than to a movie  this is not to say that it isn t fun  only to say that it is more about sensation than sense it s not every movie that would announce its shortcomings right in its title we expect pamela anderson and her vip crew to come traipsing out in their high heels and cheap props  it s a shame they don t    the film would be significantly improved without diesel  there s not much gas  at least not from the nonvehicular elements a film for people who like really loud car sounds  who get breathless when tires squeal and clutches pop  who dream of a special button near the steering wheel that takes your lemon  yellow skyline from super fast to super super fast still as high octane the second time around  even if it s firing on a few different cylinders singleton has a great visual sense  but he seems to be overthinking the action  and the result is an almost studious approach that tames the wildness of his stunts what s not to like about a movie where the actors are as model perfect as the cars essentially a series of street races even if you resist recklessness  these car catharses surge with noise  energy and adrenaline a mediocre film that could have been much worse a chaotic blur of a movie with only one discernible objective  to rev the idling engines of a mostly youthful audience even more of a joy ride than the original has its fair share of adrenaline  but the plot is shot through with more holes than christina aguilera s favorite awards outfit it s pure formula from start to finish  but that was obviously the goal from start to finish it doesn t have a brain in its head  but it s made with skill and style and  boy  is it fast and furious       pretty enjoyable if you look at it as the b movie it really ought to be  rather than the e ticket major studio release it actually is director john singleton seems to have finally found his niche  meaningless movies full of girls in tiny outfits and boys in tiny cars this is better    though less culturally interesting    than the movie that inspired it energetic if empty sequel very  very cool and very  very dumb it s ridiculous and knows it  it s the dukes of hazzard for the rave glowstick generation a crude  sloppy  four wheeled extravaganza  the best thing about this sequel is that it s not quite as bad as its ridiculous title indicates it s far too lazy to explore any new levels of stupidity  it s happy to simply loll around on the surface  recapturing already charted levels of stupidity you would think the producers would have hired a director who could put together an exciting action sequence and not the guy who made a hash of shaft for those who were less than impressed with the fast and the furious  the sequel offers up some kinetics much more in keeping with the franchise title the movie delivers what it should    cheap thrills    and serves them up with skill and economy the ride looks tricked out  but it sure is clunky under the hood for the dvd special edition  they might consider removing everything but the races and chases  including its smokey and the bandit scramble  fast forwarding may be just too much effort about as anachronistic and generic as an action sequel could be plays like an unusually bad  overblown episode of miami vice  and has virtually none of the pleasures of the original    doomed to the dreaded obscurity of films so bad  they don t even get made fun of on saturday night live it s as much of a guilty pleasure as the loud  adrenaline fueled original    maybe more so because it yields even lower expectations charged with exhilarating car racing sequences  this movie nails the car culture scene and packages it into an entertaining summer movie cars and consumerism action flick has john singleton behind the wheel but no diesel in the tank  making for a lackluster blockbuster sequel when you long for the fantasy of what hal needham could have brought to the material  you get the picture what paul walker needed was a stunt double  to stand in for him the entire movie it s unapologetic hackwork aimed at guys who never forgave mom for throwing out their hot wheels set instead of the multi everything family that races  parties and thieves together  singleton unleashes spasms of sadism and innumerable leering shots of girls gone wild  albeit    alas    not behind the wheel splashy  shallow entertainment that delivers most of what its audience expects the film has enough wild driving to satisfy any french connection fan or bullitt buff  but there s precious little for anyone else to enjoy many too many close ups of feet slamming down on pedals  hands shifting gears  and eyes narrowing meaningfully in the rear view mirror  i am the one who is furious at having to sit through this dumb movie nothing more than a drive in movie with a bigger than usual budget     the plot is custom made for long breaks at the concession counter  and the dialogue is anything but unleaded this shaggy dog sequel is ultimately satisfying for the most low tech of reasons  the competitive bond between the two central characters unless you re a car nut or big fan of camp  steer clear the cars are a rockin  and even the friggin  movie screen felt like it was shaking as the cars flew by a satisfying adrenaline rush  it is a mindless bit of escapism that speaks to the inner teenage rebel in us all strong off the starting line  it stalls before reaching the second reel due to a distinct lack of  diesel  power this unabashedly meaningless affair wholeheartedly subscribes to the more is better recipe for cinematic second installments when the ride looks and feels as smooth as this  it s practically irrelevant to complain about any lack of so called substance an example of what can happen when the lowest common denominator meets a director in sulky decline sometimes you ll laugh with the film  sometimes at it  and sometimes you ll be fumbling for the seatbelt nannannannannannannannannannannannannannannanin the end  our arrogant hero is humbled and must face the fact that he has cut himself off from real feeling  the same with our heroine  meeting each other has rendered all their tactics useless  and they stumble blind and grateful into each others arms under  whelming  and predictable cookie cutter romantic comedy fluff   will smith charms again  best for teens and up in a movie where the film s trailer has spoiled all its best scenes  and the onscreen chemistry between our primary lovebirds is a failed experiment  it s refreshing that  hitch  still provides that rare buoyant romantic lift that the genre promises does everyone fall in love after the third date  in his world  they do it s a fantasy that will fill box office coffers  but it makes for a movie that s a little too innocuous for its own good full review in greekfans of movies like the wedding planner and you ve got mail looking for a charming date movie with lots of laughs will fall in love with hitch does a fine job of staying away from an overage of boredom and sentimentality while providing a good mix of laughter along the way for what it is  hitch gets the job done smith s knockout comic performance  with its perfect pitches and pauses  ultimately saves the day harmless fun for the dating crowd sometimes cotton candy tastes really yummy  pop songs are fun for the ears  and movies like hitch can make for a breezy good time james comes crashing nervously into the movie like a fat guy who went through the wrong door and ended up on the fashion show catwalk  he s perfect will smith may be on the poster  and he may be the catalyst  but kevin james is the star and heart and soul of this movie all that s left is smith s considerable charm and james s appealing goofiness   and they re not enough sure  it has its precious moments    but hitch has the smarts to defuse them with large doses of slapstick  wit  or outright silliness the film is largely well designed fantasy that is fun and entertaining those who have seen enough of these films   and who know all their tricks   will likely recognize that hitch is nothing special works as a capsule    a snapshot    of what american metropolitan dating has become  a game of social defense hitch will make dorky  husky guys like kevin james and myself feel some hope that we too can date women who look like modelswith it s share of jerry maguire moments mixed with real romance corn  hitch is well worth the date  enjoyable romantic comedy that is sharply written and frequently laugh out loud funny  thanks to a hilarious performance by supporting actor kevin james james is a gleeful crackup opposite smith hitch isn t a memorable date merely cute when it could be affecting  pleasant when it could be relevant reminds us  sweetly  charmingly  and humorously  what will smith used to be like before he became an overnight action sensation while the last act of the film is kind of forced  most of it is just perfect    good date film        laugh yourself silly as will smith and kevin james make up the screen s most unlikely comic duo since schwarzenegger and devito in  twins  say what you  will   but mr  smith is one entertaining guywhat this comedy lacks in cleverness or originality it more than makes up for with charm i didn t expect much from hitch and  not surprisingly  i didn t get much    but i was entranced by the film nonetheless  from a historical perspective dating is difficult  relationships can be tough   hitch  wants to be the band aid that heals the wound romantic comedy is to cinema what hot dogs are to cuisine   the question is only whether it s been prepared decently  and this one has hitch claims to spit on the importance of coded language in relationships  but these are only nice asides  the film is too comfortable with the rom com statusquo agreeable if not exactly good     while both of these performers look great together  they really don t seem to belong together only has one thing going for it and that s will smith  but that s enough kevin james is the film s greatest asset by far a half hearted attempt at a valentine s day date movie  blind dates are one thing  but dumb and blind movies are another smith and mendes  unfortunately  fizzle rather than spark  a near fatal flaw in a romance that depends on its leads  chemistry to succeed hitch falls predictably in place  but it throws surprises out along the way and has surprising substance hitch wastes both will smith and kevin james with yet another convoluted romantic fablewill smith began his acting career as a prince  and he remains one of the most engaging  adorable actors on the planet smith has another hit  james beats pal ray romano to movie stardom  and acting lessons pay off for a supermodel  with involving performance by will smith and eva mendes this valentine romancer is certainly worth seeing  andy tennant may be the best marketing guru in hollywood  it s too bad he s directing hitchwill smith and kevin james keep the whole thing going thanks to the chemistry of their oddball pairingit won t change your life  but it will keep you happily entertained for a couple hours for a fairly typical romantic comedy  hitch is a mildly entertaining diversion that ultimately becomes engulfed in its formulaic trappings to play off of the heavy d aaron hall classic  now that smith has found a love story  what is hollywood gonna do with him  i look forward to finding out hitch falls into that weird gray area of movies i sort of liked  but sort of didn t i did enjoy the buddy dynamic between smith and james  who puts kind of a cocky spin on the clumsy fat guy cliches  and there were about a half dozen jokes that had me laughing out loud hitch has us from hello hitch doesn t impress with its sophomoric observations on sexual politics this lighter than air souffle offers little beyond will smith s currently palatable magnetism looks like another love tko it runs out of gas about halfway through and becomes just another sitcom with silly sight gags replacing the clever dialogue although somewhat predictable  labored and gimmicky  tennant s narrative is given a boisterous boost by its charismatic leading rogue in will smith a smart romantic comedy and a fabulous showcase for its leads and new york city setting smith is the stale prince of charming grins and adorable asides  it s astounding that this is his first real romantic comedy  because it feels like he s been doing this shtick for years having conquered independence day  will smith has set his sights on valentine s day hitch is light and funny for audiences in an undemanding mood hitch isn t the  cure for the common man   as its tagline suggests  but it s definitely the cure for the common smith and james make such an inspired comedic team     that the movie s conventional romances can t possibly match the spark these two generate this is as formulaic a comedy as humanly possible  smith s charm and his collaberation with james produce enough laughs to save it from terminal derivativity    several stories form a funny tapestry that is well woven by helmer andy tennant a likable love story that keeps you engaged even when it s tearing a few dog eared pages out of the romantic comedy playbook smith and mendes are terrific together  he brings her game up so high you d think she has had as many good parts as smith smith  of course  is so cool he can afford to pretend to be uncool  but what really works for him here is the interplay with james  whose inner wild man dance moves alone are worth the price of admission in my view  smith would do well to tweak his career a bit  how nice if he d find a small  serious movie that tests his acting chops  can the action heroes  scrap the charm manages time and again to deliver familiar notes that it then jazzes up smith has more comic charisma with james than mendes  not that there s anything wrong with that here s hoping this first romantic comedy won t be his last  or the best will smith has always had an easy time grabbing the spotlight virtually hitch free  making it a true cinema valentine you can almost see the filmmakers flailing their arms  desperately manufacturing contrivance upon contrivance to separate and reunite the movie s unlikely pair more like a skit that doesn t know when to pack it in will smith proves that if he ever wants to stop fighting screen robots  aliens or drug dealers  he is more than able to fill the rom com leading man shoes this is the sort of role smith carries off effortlessly  a decent  level headed all american guy who s more sensitive than his imposing physique might suggest it s amiable enough  but it s likely that even the easiest to please of viewers won t be overly impressed lame mistaken identity subplots are a staple of romantic comedy  but this one is intrusive and clunky by any standard the streamlined plot is nothing new  but the physical comedy and trademark smith glibness work their charm it s a good script  packed with knowing zingers about the game of love if the muddy romantic comedy hitch gives the hope of a smith freed from computerized trickery and ludicrous shoot outs  it s still not the ideal vehicle for its star s talents it is smarter than your average rom com and boasts some genuine pathos towards the end  the movie certainly has enough commendable qualities to earn referrals from dating gurus most of the credit goes to smith  who is wonderfully at ease in everything he does and here he effortlessly carries the movie even though a little less hitch might have been a better thing  the fresh prince keeps the proceedings from becoming too stale faint praise it may be  but those looking for a cute date movie this weekend could do far worse  as could smith  for that matter there are enough laughs  winning performances  attractive people and appealing romance to make hitch an amusing option for the valentine season smith  with one tweak or twinkle too much  could become too smug  too princely  but is almost totally appealing director andy tennant and screenwriter kevin bisch establish a breezy tone and offer up a new york that exists only in the movies  in the best  most escapist sense a rare studio product that earns the goodwill it smugly demands when it s funny  it s truly funny and the featured couples all have an easy and believable chemistry forget about the predictable twists  hitch works best when it s a buddy comedy  with smith and james having a blast as smooth yoda and jiggly jedi from the very opening  when hitch begins explaining to the camera that love sometimes needs an outside assist to get started  he owns the audience to enjoy this film  it helps to check your brain at the box office in the end  the two halves of the movie feel as if they are forced together  leaving messes that tennant and screenwriter kevin bisch never really clean up it s puzzling that smith has taken this long to try a romantic comedy marvelous will smith and his mostly watchable supporting cast soldier on bravely  but they re marching straight into quicksand the premise is intriguing  and for a time it seems that the date doctor may indeed know things about women that most men in the movies are not allowed to know  but the third act goes on autopilot just when the doctor should be in all of the funniest bits from  hitch  are in the trailer  what s left is a sweet  down to earth romantic comedy with a really likable cast this is surprisingly funny   it has a great opening and closing montage  both quickly establish the story and mood of the movie    will smith swept us all off our feet every so often you simply want a movie set in movie land  featuring attractive people saying things that  if not witty  at least don t need a laugh track to prop them up  and you want it to play fair within the context of its tiny universe a sweet  slick  streamlined yet  ultimately  forgettable ploy in the game of love   a klutzy  long winded  far fetched and not all that funny affair that somehow flashes an unobjectionable charm when expectations are kept low the magnetic chemistry of the actors     elevates the story s familiar rhythms above leagues of imitators     adds up to far more than the formula typically allows like eager kids on their first date  this romantic comedy stumbles and fumbles at times but its heart is definitely in the right place  sometimes that s just enough  writer  bisch    has a fairly dim view of humanity    as easily manipulated automatons   the date doctor operates like an overly eager comic intern  that s the only real glitch in hitch  hitch skates by on appeal and indefatigability of effort a romantic comedy that s easy to fall in love with    a facile  undemanding romantic comedy elevated from formula dreck by the considerable charisma of will smithwill smith s charisma helps make this sweet  slight romantic comedy about a modern cupid a light and disposable pleasure will smith is a remarkable talent  his reactive comic timing a thing of beauty hitch will make a great date movie if alex hitchens were a green thumb  he d probably be called alex gardner  if he were a cook  he d probably be alex o spatchula   but that s how romantic comedies work it s just too bad that smith wanted to play it so safe and so easy when hitch could ve benefited from a stronger vision and much bigger laughs a standard issue rom com in almost every respect  but the irresistible charm of its lead pushes it over the top screenwriter kevin bisch emphasizes tired jokes and stock situations over anything resembling reality  something that s exacerbated by a seriously overlong running time knows its formula well enough to run its finger along the grooves quick and smooth smith carries it off with his effortless charm and confidence  whether he s chatting up a woman  conspiring with the audience  or instructing a client  and director andy tennant gives it a light gloss and an easy lilt the film moves in fits and starts  and is way too long  but it may prove memorable  if only for the sweet  marvelously inventive performance of kevin james a pleasant date movie with several laughs and a couple of smiles  smith is a gifted comic actor  and seeing him in a lighthearted comedy  his first romantic lead  is a pure pleasure how reassuring to realize that happy surprises are still possible  hitch is one of the happiest not so much movie as antidote    to the cynicism that s rampant in most hollywood romantic comedies too many false endings and time issues aside  hitch is difficult to discount when it handles the rom com formula better than most of its insufferably dumbed down ilk an average romantic comedy  starring will smith and eva mendes  that is as soft and sweet as a marshmallow  and about as interesting you know what s being fed to you and yet you slurp it down just the same smith and sexy mendes spar nicely  but they don t spark  in movies  that s the kiss of death the sour subplot  in which sara s dark side mistakes hitch for a cad  staggers to a gummy resolution  throwing a wet blanket reminder that romantic comedy    indeed  romance itself    isn t what it used to be for women  it purveys the dream that men really  really care about what they think  for men  it holds out the fantasy that babes are attracted to geeky men who really  really care about what they think  what s not to like hitch suffers from a good joke deficit that even smith s charm has trouble balancing andy tennant  will smith and kevin james have managed to deliver a decent comedy out of a one note idea james and smith are terrific together the romantic comedy genre needs infusion of new blood  but this film is utterly predictable  by the number  thoigh will smith has charm  it s an equal opportunity fizzle a little like being on a blind date  bits of it are charming  much of it is awkward and several sequences plod along with the self consciousness of a first date stop and start conversation will smith finally makes the leap into romantic comedies with the delightful if somewhat predictable hitch  will  baby  what took you so long a pleasant enough meringue of a romantic comedy  light  sweet  and essentially insubstantialsmith charms his way through piled on platitudes and social faux pas  with his groove intact forget will smith and eva mendes  you ll hope for a hook up on future films between smith and the very funny kevin james  their chemistry saves an otherwise mediocre movie men may be from mars  and women from venus  but hitch hails from the planet getmesome a bright and sharp witted    if predictable    romantic comedy a warm and witty comedy that unfortunately runs itself into the ground during its final act it makes nerds and studs alike so noble that it turns the chase into a neutered game it is a romantic comedy  released for valentine s weekend no less  that is willing to look at the darker underside of datingthe makers of hitch   a film that overstays its welcome by a good half hour   seem to be the only filmmakers in hollywood to not know how to put together a fast happy endingby the time smith offers up his unnecessary race against the clock mea culpa  hitch s cupid s arrow has already veered way off course good performances pump up the fun in this lively romantic comedy the real chemistry isn t between smith and mendes  it s between smith and james like a big box of valentine s chocolates that turn out to be a mite stale when you bite into them everything about hitch seems off this is a very entertaining picture will smith is pure delight  as if we didn t know an urban fantasy  with florid observations about life and love   sometimes  competent direction and a brace of star power are enough the kind of romantic comedy that even the most unromantic lout in your life will enjoy hitch is infinitely preferable to rooting for jennifer lopez to find love with her feather duster again or watching meg ryan pretend not to age nannannannannannannannanthe level of detail is awe inspiring  and originality and charm oozes from every pixel rango is quite beautiful in its harsh  perverse way rango is a new stoner cult classic in the making the weirdness of the film is fascinating  but there s just so damn much of it delivers the western genre goods along with generous laughs and some impressive animation  and some brazenly warped sensibilities amusing in small doses  marketed to kids and not really for kids  an undeserving oscar winner meditations on identity make rango unique  and somewhat special  in the current animated film landscape if the writers had dared to step a little outside the borders of the western formula or if they d even just shaken up the old formula a bit  this really could have been something special  but sadly  it just ends up being pretty standard depp isn t as annoying in this as he has been elsewhere packed with in jokes  great characters and an offbeat anti hero  rango is the perfect shake up the animated genre needed at long last  a spaghetti western for the kiddie set    and one that doesn t sell older viewers short oddball existential western animation an animated walk on the dry sideunfocused and absolutely scattered       the best non pixar animated movie in recent memory    set in a surreally off kilter version of the wild west populated entirely by animals  computer animated western rango is both a witty spoof and loving homage to the genre kudos to the director for making it as oddball as it could get away with     this southwestern goof is really for really big kids with a love of movies  a sense of whimsy and a soft spot for the hideously gorgeous creatures of the desert  it s one of those movies that will reveal more and more to youngsters as they rewatch it in years to come    and that s the best kind of film for good or for bad  this is not your run of the mill animated feature rango is disney by way of hunter s  thompson  chinatown recast with a lizard  blazing saddles with existential angst  sergio leone s spaghetti westerns romanticallyspoofed  rango is both weird and wonderful inevitably  as seems to be the law with any modern animation  there s an intertextual dimension to the proceedings this chameleon stands out rango is as gloriously cinematic as it is witty and ironic ok  kids  who s ready for an animated version of  fear and loathing in las vegas  sergio leone meets chuck jonesa third act cameo sets a high water mark of awesome  especially for fans of deadwood if ever there was an animated film made for film critics  rango is it the kind of computer animation that lingers so exquisitely on the little things  the romance is sweetly underplayed and coen like moments of hyper erudition and eccentric  grizzled characters make for a rollicking escapade a smart  satirical  and expertly animated adventure aimed at adults and children alike    reminds one of how special animation can be brilliantly bonkers  this animated western weirdo should scare little kids while dazzling adults with its inspired approach to demented homage inventive visuals and lively voice cast lift this finely animated film above the fray  so it s a shame that the story feels both random and predictable any serious  dark minded child who s up on high noon  the good  the bad and the ugly  chinatown  fear and loathing in las vegas and the writings of carlos castaneda will really find their precociousness rewarded  rango  is one of the best works of literature i ve enjoyed for many years   rango  is one of the best family films i ve seen in years   rango  is one of the best westerns i ve ever seen going in  i was expecting much more standard children s fare  not an existential undertaking with shout outs to everything from chinatown to don quixote  just when you thought you d seen everything  here comes chinatown  the animated version it would be unfair  and inaccurate  to call rango a one joke movie  there may be two or three  i didn t count  the first laugh comes with the appearance of a    rango is a precision built  artistically rich and intelligently entertaining movie that deserves to become a hit and a classic rango  has everything going for it    strong characters  complex plotting  and a knowledge of the genre it parodies without excluding newcomers to it  it s smart without being alienating and exciting without being mindless  channeling spaghetti westerns  cervantes  castaneda  and a dash of chinatown as refracted through the visual sensibilities of dali  it is a fiendishly clever concretion of high  and low brow in a story that is both vision quest and farcequick witted animated western spoof gets plenty mileage out of good writing  a grand sense of fun  and the voice of johnny depp rango a dynamic tribute to a lost genre sergio leone meets  the shakiest gun in the west  in this odd movie about a chameleon who    credit the filmmakers for their cleverness    doesn t blend in a welcome change from formula as it travels on tangents that vary from the crazed to the surrealthere is never a doubt rango will succeed by film s end  but the movie does have its charms  boasts a richer  stranger cinematic flavor than anything in verbinski s pirates of the caribbean moviesthough young children may enjoy it  the film is built for viewers of any age with a taste for joyful anarchy what it loses in coherence and dexterity it gains in pure sensationalism  whether it be visual  verbal  or narrativewhat a joy to see an original vision constructed with so much passion and smarts if the art of the mashup is what passes for originality these days  then rango is a creative tour de force  existential  inventive and irreverentfull review at movies for the massesthe stunning overall look    which tips its ten gallon hat at western classicists like john ford and sergio leone while winking slyly at salvador dali    qualifies as a work of art in its own right the film unspools as an admittedly bizarre blending of an animated adventure film for kids and a meta comedy about a character who must morph from being a fictitious hero to being a real one not often does one see an animated family film where someone talks about experiencing a  paradigm shift  or says   i think your metaphor broke my spleen   very funny  packed with solid action  animated with a remarkable degree of care and creativity  and delivered with a breathless sense of energy there s absolutely no arguing that it comes from the same mentality of test marketing and formula and commercial calculation as most american animation does right now even if the story about a dust bowl town s diminished water supply isn t quite thrilling enough  the film makes up for it with wacked out dream sequences and a general oddball tonein the end  rango  despite its many pleasures  is a bit too smart for its own good it s very  very interesting but it s sort of like you ve got to have that magic combination  you ve got to have looks and heart with its many allusions to other films like chinatown  the three amigos and any number of spaghetti westerns  rango seems to have pulled off the pixar trick of entertaining both young and old rango is an impressive and wonderfully strange film there are some great sight gags and the script has some good lines  but there aren t enough of them   and the plot is rather slight and predictable the western isn t dead  it s just become more animated    literally fantastical tale of the reptile that conquered the wild west rango is like chinatown meets a fistful of dollars meets a geico commercial  and it s totally awesome this one is for johnny depp devotees only  the animation is good but the overall effect of the movie is dull it doesn t know what kind of a film it is closer to a comedy for adults than a kids  flick  this ground breaking and simply unmissable animation bursts with creativity  humour and clever references minutes into the audaciously animated rango  i wondered whether someone had slipped peyote into my soft drink    this movie is obviously not right in the head  and i love it i just don t know if we ll see a film as smart or fun or overwhelmingly rich as rango for the rest of the year  while the pace of the film is slow  the colorful characters  witty dialog  movie references and beautiful artwork make this a pony ride worth taking the movie basically adheres to the conventions of the genre as well as the western spoofs made popular by comedians such as bob hope  abbott and costello  and mel brooks in  blazing saddles gore verbinski s sophisticated  extremely amusing cgi animated movie  a cartoon for adults as opposed to an adult cartoon   who else but johnny depp would gore verbinski want to voice the character of rango  given how they worked together to create jack sparrow  a pirate in the caribbean     rango  let s face it  is another colourful character  there s a lot to like about rango  the colourful  kooky chameleon looking for enlightenment in this unique and imaginative animation that takes the form of a western  and embraces a zoo of weird and wonderful charactersthis is a smart  hip comedy that works for adults and youngsters alike these strange looking characters are hard to love  they didn t generate the excitement and enthusiasm that i was hoping for the film reunites director gore verbinski with star johnny depp  and just as with their pirates of the caribbean collaboration it begins very promisingly before descending into a chaotic mess there s more visual wit in gore verbinski s rango than the last two pixar films combined there are a couple of frightening sequences with a rattlesnake and a hawk that may scare small children  but all ends well  rango will rope you in a work that in its finest moments comes across as a coen brothers film with anthropomorphic animals instead of flesh and blood humans admirably ambitious animated ode to spaghetti westerns featuring a johnny depp voiced lizard as the unlikely hero    whole heartedly casts its lot with the grown ups in the audience  paying homage to sergio leone  carlos castaneda  hunter s  thompson  and roman polanski s chinatown     so  let s dispel the illusion that this movie is for kids it s almost like sergio leone was adapting a kenneth grahame story with all of these crazy characters running around and hans zimmer s perfect spaghetti western score   rango  is a treat for everyone who enjoys animation  rango  is a delight from start to finish  both visually and in its creative writing adults and slightly older children should have a great time the funny and powerfully weird rango is probably the closest i ve seen a big budget  computer animated feature get to the comic vibe of my favorite chuck jones cartoons a cgi western comedy populated by desert critters  rango gives the film year a belated jump start with a passel of movie wise fun and a knockout animation style all in all  rango is a freaky and fun ride  with some tasty philosophical asides and references for the grownups to chew on  with his first animated feature  pirates of the caribbean director gore verbinski shows ambitions considerably beyond producing the usual standard of most children s fare  to put it plainly  rango is one weird movie yes   there are  enough nods to other sources to make rango a bobblehead  but the movie  and much of john logan s writing  is still pretty durn clever the best of rango is a lot like the best of the first pirates movie    crazily funny and rambunctious what elevates it above a cheeky romp is the skilled cgi work  not only the wealth of tactile detail lavished on the parched townsfolk but also the painterly  sand swept vistas they call home amusing and thrilling albeit slightly overlong with dazzling visuals and clever nods to classic westerns  he is  sinking deeper into the guacamole of his own deception   says the owl who leads a mexican mariachi band that serves as the story s greek chorus   a description that shows you just how willfully weird are the goings on  the humor is dry  dusty and packed with animated caricatures of legendary movie characters  guns and deep thoughts make this best for older kids some good bits about the nature of heroism  but not enough to elevate rango to the ranks of pixar  still  when viewed as a silly comedy adventure  it s enjoyable a defiantly weird and unexpectedly charming effort that could easily feel at home at both matinees and on the midnight movie circuit a delightfully strange  if somewhat inconsistent  animated western no tightly plotted pixar masterpiece  rango is its own insane expression  a nervy bundle of outrageous daring  jangled and tangled to a free wheeling fare thee well  green hasn t been this much fun since early shrek parents will be nudging aside their children to check out the thoroughly mature western known as rangowhether your a fan of film  a fan of animation or just a fan of having fun in the theater rango is a delight across the board a damn fine western  an entertaining throwback to classic b pictures that pays clever tribute to its predecessors clear proof that a great director can work in any genre and medium and produce great results the only thing more astonishing than its subversive sense of humor and general anarchy is the fact that a studio is putting it in wide release this is one of those movies where the grandiose vision is there  but it never gels rango is clever and entertaining  not for the very young perhaps  but ideal for teens and adults    viewers will eventually find themselves growing tired of the movie s meandering structure and unusually deliberate pace   as animation  this is top class  and a mile away from the orthodox  some of the detail is terrific  and the screenplay is sharply intelligent the strangeness is off the scale in a kooky concoction that might have been hatched at the bottom of a bong  then again  what do you expect with johnny involved an ultra quirky animated western with a vocal tour de force by johnny depp that s quite unlike anything i ve ever seen a sun baked symphony of rust and dust  rango has a spiky  unsentimental appeal  sending out slightly risque jokes to parents while staying safely out of the danger zone for kids nothing about this witty  inventive film obeys the rules what it borrows and what it builds combine to feel original and strange frantically and refreshingly fun one of my favorites of this young year and among the most unique features i ve seen from an american animation house in recent memory wry  genial  and not at all interested in jumping on the bandwagon of flash in the pan pop cultural hipness   rango  holds an eclectic eye for finding beauty in the unusual from start to finish this is a wonderful and immensely creative animated film about a loser who arises to the challenges faced in a town without water  there are hundreds of clever details and imaginative flourishes to make it worthy of being put into the same category as the films to which it so charmingly pays tribute  it is depp  however  who really nails this thing by simply blending in with all the other voice talent and characters and not reverting to the oversized captain jack sparrow swagger a possible cult hit  it s too self indulgent to find a mass audience verbinski has made an animated feature unlike any other on the current mainstream landscape  for a big budget animated picture  rango sure is an odd little varmint for a movie about finding one s identity  rango spends an awful lot of time searching for one of its own the film itself is a magically strange hybrid  a spoofy computer animated western acted out by anthropomorphic desert creatures it is not self conscious knowingness that drives rango but rather a quirky and sincere enthusiasm for all the strange stuff that has piled up in the filmmakers  heads over the years every other week  it seems there is some new creation full of fantastically realized creatures engaging in eye tricking action  the ironic effect of this    is a so what else you got state of jaded exhaustion  and then along comes rango i ve made a good case for seeing  rango   and why not  an eye feast is still a feast in this lean multiplex season its strong suit is visual panache  it s too bad that consistent comedy and emotional resonance get lost amid the dust and cacti say what you will about  rango   the computer animated western riding hard on johnny depp doing the voice of a lizard   just don t call it business as usual  it s verbinski s trust in the audience to get his jokes and pop culture references that makes  rango  such an engaging ride the film features some of the most astounding computer animation ever  and  thanks to a slew of terrific voice actors who are obviously having a great time  the film is wildly  weirdly amusing sharp edged  surreal  and often astonishing in its giddy creativity it s an exuberant  audacious love letter to spaghetti westerns  masquerading as a kiddie cartoon  and it delivers deliciously on both levels what makes this unhinged  wildly self conscious comedy adventure more than a two hour gimmick is an inspired vocal performance by verbinski s  pirates of the caribbean  star  johnny depp you know those animated films that have bits that the parents will enjoy  rango is mostly those bits verbinski s scored an offbeat oddity  a classic western with surreal elements and references to films from  chinatown  to  star wars    if only he d known when enough is enough   it doesn t always work  but it does set itself resolutely apart from the pack  and if you look closely  you can spot the occasional moment of genius rango   is a highly watchable but somewhat frustrating mix of sloppy plotting  rascally attitude  and big action ignoring the weak storyline entirely  rango is a joyously weird experience  far more concerned with texture and flavor than with elaborate narrative consistently plays like an adult movie in uncomfortably fitting family friendly clothes rango is the revitalising injection of new blood that animated cinema didn t know it needed absolutely wonderfulit loosens the shackles of a post pixar post blue sky animation landscape  where family entertainment must either be an emotional roller coaster or mindless slapstick an animated picture that can bear comparison to pixar s best   in attitude and style it s distinctive and witty  walking a fine line between respectful homage and spoof doesn t build to anything substantial  instead dragging along interminably while its sense of humor succumbs to heat exhaustion   a gorgeous picture  but its soullessness wears down the viewing experience a neon colored  sun baked fantasia that s part western spoof and part surrealist jag through the desert with johnny depp as our theatrically unhinged  reptilian tour guide  rango is anything but your standard kiddie animated flick well  visually rango looks excellent  then characters start talking it s all technically brilliant  but maybe lacking a little in charm and true wit rango never shuts up  but he never has anything funny or touching or clever to say i m honestly not sure whether or not it s a good movie  but it doesn t leave you much time to ponder that question it coasts on strangeness only so long before the novelty wears off it s a droll and invigorating alternative to the disney and dreamworks models  at the same time  you wish that verbinski had a tighter grip on his storyline rango turns out to be a master of adaptability and good will in the end  in fact  an educating and entertaining little ambassador for all with an addictive personality this digimated all animal western borders on the inspired neither rango the mash up movie nor rango the lizard is particularly lovable  but there s no denying the intrigue in its combination of the good  the bad  and the ugly toplined by johnny depp  who s in great form  rango is a thematically witty  visually striking animated western  a movie that could be enjoyed by younger and mature viewers in different ways there are some wonderful things in  rango   the dialogue is witty  the animation is dizzying and the action is stunningly choreographed not many animated escapades aim to please such a broad audience  even the poo jokes are sophisticated visually inventive and enjoyably quirky   it s refreshing to see an animated movie that doesn t look as though the idea for the happy meal came first while depp turns his bug eyed reptile into a charismatic character  the plot gets lost in a maze of tangents and the story has too many tasteless jokes    like a prostate gag    that are not kid friendly perhaps a new classification has been born  the  spaghettios western an animated homage to western movies from classic to revisionist  old fashioned to postmodern  rango plumbs existential depths and hits movie lover highs  w hat a  coen brothers   animated flick might look like and sound like  if they got an assist from terry giliam  this is a deeply weird and deeply demented movie  and thrillingly so visually  so stunning and clever that you can almost forgive that  really  it s not very funny  incredibly artful   but its grasp of the art of comedy is unfortunately slight the most satisfying non pixar animated movie to emerge in some time so weird i can t believe they got to make this movie a terrific saturday matinee for pretty much anyone a rollicking  surreal  and existential kids  western that worships at the altars of sergio leone  hunter s  thompson  and chinatown  rango drowns under the weight of discordant objectives and influences rango is the most beautiful animated film since the golden age of hand drawn cartoons  shame that the movie has no heart beneath all that beauty  though rango feels unhinged at its best moments  like anything might happen  and it s liberating to see such talented people running so absolutely off the rails johnny depp isn t the sort of star to blend in  so it s saying something that his turn as the world s most conspicuous chameleon in rango is so full bodied  you forget the actor and focus on the character madly clever animated sagebrush saga has style and wit to burn    a fleet  quirky  computer animated feature that i found ingenious  charming and almost entirely engaging state of the art animation collides with postmodern pastiche on a busy road along which wayside legend will always count for more than supposed progress western myths infuse with the story of a lizard facing an existential crisis  his name  rango it s ultimately a pastiche by numbers and doesn t live up to its full potential  but as a visual treat and one of depp s better vehicles of recent years  it delivers the basic goods spoofs such kiddie favourites as fear and loathing in las vegas  the mystical writings of carlos castaneda  and sergio leone s dollars trilogy nannannanthe strengths are amazing  and it s pretty impressive how thoroughly and successfully the movie rewrote the vocabulary of action cinema second in trilogy is a smooth but violent thriller more than adequately serves as a no nonsense escapist action thriller as bourne seeks to uncover his past and bury those who would cross him  director paul greengrass masterfully blends sight  sound and silence to do much more than entertain  this film leaves a deep psychological imprint while not as engaging as  the bourne identity   the sequel fills a void in the undernourished spy movie genre  what more could you ask for in a sequel a huge leap of faith is required to connect  and many plot details appear to have not been properly thought through it is a spy film for adults and it avoids over the top pyrotechnics and jokey one liners  and instead delivers a mature  intelligent thriller by the end of the film  we ve more or less given up trying to figure out how the characters are making their deductions  we just have to take it on faith that somehow everyone knows to go to a specific address in moscow a thriller with a brain  a grown up film for grown upsflashes of color and streaks of movement can make for a striking picture  but only if you can see what s taking place  not to mention if you care about who is in jeopardy where it could have descended into a revenge drama  it settles for justice instead    and not the kind that puts down one s enemies  but the kind that calls for confession  even reconciliation  director  greengrass proves himself equally adept at action  building on the edginess of doug liman s original with a feverish handheld camera and frenetic editing supremacy is  minor quibbles aside  a worthy successor to the bourne identity stylish  full throttle  nobody s pretending this is art summer movie fun at times  it s a bit too much like watching the zapruder film  but    it keeps the audience sharp by forcing them to search for clues and stay focused on the action the bourne supremacy offers both brains and brawn  but without the ability to enjoy any of the action  the film falls to mediocre levels yet another of the all reason defying examples of sequels that are as good as if not better than their earlier films improves on the original by leaps and bounds tries to top the original by offering two car chases  but they both chop space into blurry  discontinuous fragments   as with the car chases  so with the bourne supremacy the bourne supremacy shows how a spy film should really be done i m here to tell you that it didn t disappoint damon makes bourne a consistent  driven  intelligent  and yet vulnerable hero  it s too bad academy voters will fail to notice his fantastic performance a first rate thriller that plays out with the pluck and style of the best james bond films like the first film  supremacy belongs to damon  and he doesn t disappoint    maintaining a level of intensity that would impress even the coldest of trained killers to read review visit www emanuellevy comwith a rash of movies about resentful operatives or foot soldiers who can t tell whom to fear more  the enemy or their own leaders  they may be telling us somethingbrainy  intelligent  emotional filmmaking that just happens to be in the thriller genre this might work on video while imbibing illegal drugs  however  as it stands   don t bother a roller coaster ride of unglamorous sophistication and artful escapes a steady  engrossing thriller matt damon s jason bourne brings new meaning to the word  spy   a fine example of a sequel to surpass the original matt damon again pulls off a great mix of inscrutability and vulnerability the bourne supremacy is something of a double rarity  an exciting  intelligent hollywood thriller and a worthy sequel to boot bourne himself hovers above mere physical threats  draining this action movie of any urgency exciting  emotionally layered and brimming with invention you can t put a price on a film maker who still believes stunts should be shot in the street and not the editing suitea brisk  engrossing and intelligent thriller the bourne supremacy is a sharp  intelligent thriller that expertly mixes international espionage with a revenge story delivers as long as quibblers needing story  character and credibility can set aside their priorities if you enjoyed the  bourne identity  you ll enjoy the  bourne supremacy  as much   just don t expect much more than that conveys a real sense of danger  both emotional and physicalsuch an exhilarating thriller     don t be surprised if you leave the movie sweaty and exhausted from the workout  of its kind  the bourne supremacy is incredibly skilled    much more exciting than its predecessor the picture fires on all pistons hand paul greengrass his walking papers     and tell him to take his hand held camera with him the acting was astounding  the plot was superb and the direction nailed it falls flat on its counter intelligent face   if i wanted to watch an olympic steeplechase  i d wait for the athens games does what it promises    gives great tense drama and action  however  jerky camera work is somewhat annoying the movie culminates with a sloppily edited car chase that goes on for so long that i had to be reminded  was matt damon playing jason bourne or sheriff buford t  justice another of those incoherent robert ludlum spy thrillers with more logistics than logic a cinematic page turner the bourne supremacy offers cool thrills and explosive action not a perfect film  but it provides enough excitement and intrigue to keep the popcorn crowds well entertained and glued to their seats for future bourne adventures in a summer drenched in cgi effect extravaganzas  it s easy to forgive the bourne supremacy its occasional transparent plot device this is a complex  grown up thriller that s rich in its gritty detail and nearly flawless in its stuntwork if the fugitive starred an invincible super spy and was shot with a broken steadicam   you d have this half decent  hyperactively edited  arms length chase thriller  the pacing is lively  yet still easy to followfans of the original film will certainly be pleased with this sequel the car chase near the end of the film is one of most exciting shots ever i was riveted by  the  exhausting hand to hand combat and adrenaline pumping car chases   dizzying editing and camera work will bother some  and the sheer complexity of the telling will confuse more people a convoluted concoction of shaky hand held camera shots and stomach churning edits meant to simulate the feeling you d get if you were tossed over niagara falls in a barrel frantic and fresh   the bourne supremacy  is a chic spy thriller that s even better than the original the old school cold war spy thriller is bourne again much like bourne  the film is a lean  mean  killing machine  and the action  near constant  is frightfully good a smart thriller for a smart audience the bourne supremacy is an exceptional thriller that is a sequel to a good one    power runs through every frame  making the smallness of the world itself seem scary i felt like i was jason bourne watching the movie  because i was one step ahead of it the entire way through   but even when bourne is not at his best  he s still impressive damon  who carries a certain blankness and anger with him  is right at home playing people who don t quite fit in and are tying desperately to find where they belong rank s  as a solid sequel  one that plays to the original s strengths as a sleek  brainy alternative to cartoonish james bond bloat to its credit  supremacy passes on the glib vigilante scenario and aspires  fitfully  to something more ambitious and ambiguous  something involving conscience  responsibility  and humility exhausting but thrilling at the same time  the movie is utterly synthetic good enough to make one have faith in certain things again  like spy movies  sequels and the charismatically low key  quietly lethal movie star charisma of matt damon a tour de force of thriller filmmaking almost everything that made the bourne identity refreshing    the wit  the irony  the suspense  the novelty of its premise    is gone greengrass gives the new film edginess and energy  though his almost constant use of jittery hand held cameras might exhaust some viewers one of the busiest car chase  car crash movies ever bourne s amnesia gimmick is a tired one  but there is a future in spy movies with this sort of blend of action and cynicism solid summer entertainment while the movie has a higher iq than the average summer action blitz  it underperforms as a thrill dispenser matt damon and paul greengrass have created a fiery  quick witted film that presents compelling evidence that the action suspense genre has been  bourne again eye rattling visual chaos that many moviegoers will want to rate x  for excedrin the movie is mostly a series of frenetic clashes  dubious near misses and car chases  it lacks the human interest and snowy splendor of the first movie the movie skillfully delivers a series of fights  stalkings  plottings and chases  punctuated by a little brooding an entertaining spy thriller thankfully free of the campy  tongue in cheek excesses of the recent james bond films the screenplay by tony gilroy     cuts ludlum s convolutions down to size  improves his leaden dialogue vastly and distills the action of the book to its essence a rare breed of action flick    one that doesn t take human life for granted this new bourne adventure  adapted from robert ludlum s book  is somewhat too long and burdened with one too many exhaustingly chaotic car chases  but it s still almost as intelligent  exciting and fun as its predecessor just as thrilling  edgy and entertaining as the first installment a terse  tight  impressively smart package a solid cloak and dagger actioner by treating the subject matter with the same kind of raw emotional intensity as his recent fact based drama  director greengrass literally puts us in the driver s seat matt damon   yeah  he s still a badass by the end i felt someone had put my brain in a blender while damon doesn t have the benefit of surprising anyone with its sequel   the bourne supremacy   it proves just as enjoyable as its predecessor the plot is a solid one  there are several twists and  although the final villains are known early in the film  it keeps you guessing as to how the end will play out  helping the plot is a strong cast that gives great performances the bourne supremacy not only lives up to the promises of the novel by robert ludlum  but in many ways manages to improve on the first film as a video game that propels the viewer through the course  supremacy is supremely successful  i m not sure that s enough for a movie narrative instead of setting aside creativity to kneel before the movie machine conformitybot  greengrass jumped out from a dark corner and knocked the  bot out with a bag of nickels not a greatly different recipe from that of the first picture  but the results aren t as tasty this time around   jason should not have been re bourne the bourne supremacy is a summer action film    yet it impresses with its intelligence and its willingness to buck convention the bourne supremacy    shares the attributes of its star  matt damon  solid  down to earth  good looking but not too flashy  and often capable of surprising you director paul greengrass actually has a better sense of pacing than his predecessor  doug liman a sequel that actually trumps the original    establishes a tense atmosphere almost immediately    and barely lets up for the next two hours james bond only does things you could never do  but bourne does things you could never even think of spy movies just got thrilling again gripping film a refreshing alternative to the hypertrophied spy thrillers in which exaggerated action sequences  over the top super villainy and high tech gadgetry trump character and plot a dandy paranoid thriller that begins confusingly but gets swifter and leaner as it goes an enjoyable enough night at the movies  though it s not as well crafted as its predecessor with its foot pressed to the floor from beginning to end  bourne is a non stop gas if you ve forgotten the kick you get from watching a globe trotting  butt kicking  whiplash paced action movie done with humor  style and smarts  take a ride with the bourne supremacy falls short of its predecessor in almost every area  except perhaps acting the bourne supremacy is essentially a string of how  will he get  out this one set pieces  but they have been cooked up with nerve frying elan by british director greengrass a classy if over caffeinated sequel a worthy successor to the smash original better than average summer fare brilliantly paced and cut a spy thriller for espionage fans who feel that james bond has gone soft in the head an excellent follow up that confirms bourne as a first class movie franchise the bourne supremacy is a dynamite sequel that begs for at least one more outing with this spy who refuses to come in from the cold more action filled and tense than the bourne identity don t let this slip by you as thrillers go  supremacy is indeed supreme moviegoers who complain about what a shaky camera does to their innards should pack antacids for this one supremacy is briskly paced and the screenwriting is fairly clever and crafty and salvages the film as a whole a smart and jittery sequel this admirable franchise should change your idea of what makes a good thriller a sequel that reaches a higher plateau than its predecessor a disappointment from the director of bloody sunday almost as good as its predecessor the movie pulses forward relentlessly  and the tension never slackens it s good enough to make a third bourne movie a welcome possibility somebody needs to tell filmmakers that holding a camera by hand and shaking it around is not artistic  it looks like the bourne witch project from top to bottom  from the action parts to the talky bits  the bourne supremacy is a movie that absolutely flies by with nary an unnecessary breath spy sequel has serious kick thanks to tony gilroy s black coffee script and paul greengrass s two fisted direction a kind of rehash of the fast parts in the first movie  it s not totally satisfying  but it s fun while it lasts top drawer genre filmmaking    an intense  intelligent  exciting  impeccable spy thriller     delivers the expected adrenaline driven thrills with a fresh eye and a refreshing attitude   despite the high speed car chases and the gleaming high tech weaponry   the bourne supremacy  is empty of any lasting impressions a sequel that  whatever its actual motivation  doesn t feel like a studio mandated cash grab  but an organic continuation of the original  both in content and style basically you have the fugitive with cia agents moving through an entire plot that could be written on a napkin  but it moves like a thunderbolt riding a cheetah the bourne supremacy  is an exciting  finely crafted action thriller with the accent on  thrill the bourne supremacy fizzles with its reliance upon a plethora of chase sequences to compensate for its failure to create an engrossing protagonist matt damon is re bourne as a compelling action figurebourne supremacy s tag line   they should have left him alone  is so completely apropos for this particularly puzzling sequel  f antastic  a whiz bang follow up that far surpasses the original as it breathlessly zigs and zags all over the globe the familiar character driven story is yet another fast paced  high stakes  globe trotting adventure with shaky hand held camerawork and quick cut editing a welcome throwback to blood soaked espionage thrillers  the bourne supremacy is a gritty sequel that hasn t lost its popular appeal only the car chase  the best in years  is not confusing the bourne supremacy ups the ante and the story zooms to a whole new level while still keeping the paranoia and the spy vs spy feel of the first film if damon played harrison ford s deckard character in the first film  in the second he s rutger hauer s roy batty greengrass knew not to screw up a good thing it has an enviable level of clarity and plausibility while dynamically satisfying the conventions and requirements of the thriller the most fun you ll have in theaters this summerthe way the film has been made  nothing that happens seems inevitable    which is to say  anything seems possible  there s a word for that sensation  it s called excitement so oppressively identified with its predecessor s look  sound  and design that doug liman warrants a co director credit a breathless sequel with tense intellectual punch  smart  seat gripping action  and a hero who is utterly compelling  almost without saying a word have you noticed that the older he gets  the more matt damon resembles ray liotta   it s essential preparation for my remake of operation dumbo drop   notes matt this dark  daring sequel is bourne s journey to acknowledge the blood on his hands and atone for sins of his half remembered past  it s a tougher  more complicated movie  a cut above your average fantasy world espionage thriller the film s goals are in the right place  character development and character growth a cold  calculating virtual redux of the bourne identity that leaves a bitter aftertaste in its wake  audiences have seen this all before  many times over once again  damon scores in the title role by never courting audience sympathy and playing his all american good looks against the hard shell brutality of the character every time you feel like you re finally grabbing hold of something involving  the picture once again spins frustratingly out of reach most of supremacy is an overedited headache that hardly makes up in frayed nerves what the visuals lack in clarity     one of the best thrillers in recent years nannancheck your brain at the door from the opening  adrenalin pumping prison bus escape to a heart pounding car theft aboard a fast moving train  fast five throws it down from the jump each movie has two very good action scenes  usually at either end  but then about an hour and a half of the most asinine tough guy nonsense between them    achieves the sort of zen chaos that defines the die hard filmshard core fans of the series with enjoy it but others should steer away from this over the top action flick has really transformed this series from camp action cinema to exciting heist cinema fast five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting  the film is full of clean  well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit  making the film s running time breeze by like a shot of nitro to the franchise and shows there s plenty left in the tank manages to be more fun than any movie with its outrageous carbon footprint has any right to be the series has found new traction in the heist format    resulting in a fun and immensely entertaining ride one film was enough  two was plenty  but five is just absurd  undoubtedly  there will be several people who will flock to this film just because it has cars zooming back and forth  so at least some people will be pleased with it the jauntier vibe makes for easier viewing between the big high speed car set pieces  which are every bit as big  loud  and crazily over the top preposterous as one would expect and hope it s about cars  girls and fighting and doesn t pretend to be anything else  for sheer gall alone   fast five  provides much entertainment  just not much intellect fast five is grindingly mechanical    and not just because of all the emphasis on car repairs and retooling forget physics  it s just a fun blast of action movie ingenuity  as is the film as a whole  it s not like i m asking for the road warrior    just some basic coverage and a less than total reliance on camera movement to generate excitement director justin lin has a spooky  second sense for staging bombastic action sequences  even if he breaks every law in physics to make them work it s trying so hard to pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease  but that s also why it s entertainingnostalgic for older team films  and a world in which people interacted face to face   a frustratingly protracted piece of work that should have been so much better   fifth time s the charm a loud  full throttled  bombastic heist flick with no apologies for its obsessions with speed  violence  intensity cars zoom  guns blaze  and the quips fly with wild abandon  but the biggest achievement to be found here is the pairing of vin diesel and dwayne johnson  about effing time   johnson s  skin looks as though it s been slathered in butter  his enjoyment is infectious and keeps the movie speeding along though the smash bang chases make for dumb fun  it all mostly cruises in a noisy neutral  and with his film clocking in at over two hours  director justin lin might have raised his own speed limit cutting right to the chase  fast five is sure to make a furious run at the box office while this is the best in the franchise since the first film  i still don t like it because watching vin diesel in anything makes me want to punch myself in the face   and that s just not healthy  occasionally  though not frequently enough  something awesome happens even with the over the top acting of dwayne johnson and mind numbing action sequences the film is actually watchable  maybe being pretty darn dumb is part of its charm this movie is so drenched with testosterone  it belongs on major league baseball s banned substances list all that distinguishes fast five from this year s crop of crappy action films is a modicum of craft  cleverness and restraint people die  cars collide  things get blown sky high  but none of it feels at all suspenseful  lin is much better at comedy relief  which includes a sexy con by gadot  who beats the all hands drug czar at his own game sequel number four proves this franchise isn t getting older   it s getting better vin diesel and dwayne  the rock  johnson square off in a movie at last  it s a cosmic event  like some freak planetary collision a screeching  testosterone propelled fifth installment for this durable  high octane franchise for those of us who thought diesel and dwayne  the rock  johnson were  separated at birth   these two have a best of the baldies throwdown that rocks our action loving world fast five  is easily one of the best in the series  fast cars  romance  family ties and a heist comparable to that of  oceans eleven  so long as they re driving it s fine  but whenever they stop to open their mouths  it grinds to a halt another dazzling display of stunt driving and death defying car chases involving souped up  stolen automobiles  don t leave your brain at the door like other critics are suggesting  just hide it behind a beer helmet and gleefully guzzle teh stoopid away a dumb  ridiculous movie filled with enough tough guy stares and male posturing to last you the entire summer  but it s also high on extreme stunts and crazy car crashes  carried off with minimal aid from cgi  which is actually very refreshing it s big  loud  dumb  over the top and mostly substanceless  but it works  perhaps better than ever before  one those exceptional sequels  even better than the original film   the fast and the furious  stating that fast five is the best of the fast and the furious series is perhaps like claiming that the big mac is the best hamburger served at mcdonald s  it s not so much a declaration of excellence as an example of damning with faint praise one of the better entries in the series  that s not to say it isn t big and dumb  only that its big dumbness is executed with some degree of competence    opens with a bang and picks up speed from there   spectacular cinematography   loaded to the gills with high octane music  wow  the only way this film could be more ludicrous is if they actually cast ludacris in it  oh wait   all together now     if you loved the first four furious films there s no reason on earth why you won t dig fast fivethat force of chaotic and unsatisfiable desire that freud called the id is much closer to the surface in a movie like  fast five  than ever before in action cinema history  and part of lin s peculiar genius is that he barely tries to conceal it the film s plot rarely makes sense and the script is lackluster  but who cares when each chase is composed of the right amount of speed and clarity  lin never puts his foot on the break until the last possible second the action in this movie is the key to what makes it fun  who cares about the plot  character  story or even physics at this point  if it looks cool on screen  it works the calendar may say that summer is a few months away  but the escapist entertainment that the season is known for starts today with the release of this rocking thrill ride  one of the most purely enjoyable movies in a long time the chemistry of the core cast   steered by vin diesel and paul walker   keeps this outing from running on fumes the whole thing progresses to one of the looniest heists of all time  the result is the most exciting  visually jazzy  and absurd entry in the series as always  the action combines buff bods  sculpted sheet metal  testosterone  guns  bone crushing throwdowns  tattoos  revving engines and a  transformers  like delight in having as many things as possible smash into each othersure  the plot  dialogue and acting are as silly as usual  but buoyed by a sparkling rio setting and an awesomely staged third act action setpiece  fast five is the series  best outing since the original  this is what a summer movie should be   knowingly silly  fun  light  thrilling  packed with real stunts and not so subtle gayness originality isn t fast five s goal so much as distillation  lin s aim is to make the ultimate version of a fast and the furious film and the third time appears to be the charm for him as director  fast five is the best of the series it s still a  check your brains at the door  action entry  but as a thrill ride it  sets the high bar for the summer s releases fast five s final chase sequence involving a stolen vault is  hands down  the best action sequence of the entire franchise watching fast five is like being savagely beaten for two hours and ten minutes by the staff at advance auto parts there s check your brains at the door and then there s brain dead  fast five  the improbable fourth sequel to the fast and the furious  falls somewhere between the two  making sure the audience knows that the writers   get it   with a little humor and some crazy action makes the silliness easy to forgive and fun to watch finally  the rock has come back to the action genre you can t say fast five delivers the goods  but it delivers what it s supposed to with a bit better plot and character familiarity  fast five is more fun than the original and now ranks   at least in this critic s opinion   as the best of the bunch always preposterous though never actually silly  knowingly funny without ever being self conscious  fast five is a passable action flick that will more than entertain its core audience fifth entry in the series could be the best  with a muy macho cast and delirious action sequences delivering exactly what fans want bold and beautiful in its hard charging simplicity a paean to reckless driving and fuel inefficency  this fifth film in the franchise is the most spectacular and elaborate yet  bringing new meaning to the term  muscle car  by pitting series regular vin diesel against dwayne  the rock  johnson the supreme idiocy on display really wouldn t matter if the film just bothered to acknowledge it a balls to the wall action film  and never for a second does it deviate doesn t make much sense  but its action worksfast five  is the perfect definition of a guilty pleasure movie  in this film  what stunt drivers and stunt people do with their machines and bodies defy the laws of physics  nature and reason embarrassingly fun  the sort of speedy  senseless  violence crammed action flick that virtually defines the summer season  with superheroes who aren t gods or crusaders in tights but guys in t shirts and jeans who can drive cars really fast even with wooden acting and dreadful dialogue  the action packed charms of fast five cannot be denied i can forgive a lot if you make me leave the theater thinking  that    was    awesome with its sweat glistening off tanned muscles mannerism and hard nosed bare knuckle bravado  fast five is the perfect cure for a spring season filled with failed attempts at recapturing past glories if there were any more testosterone here  jose canseco could have boiled down the screen and injected it if hollywood can make the rest of the summer as brainlessly fun as this then maybe people will start going back to the multiplex if you re in the mood for the cinematic equivalent of sugar and trans fats  the film delivers with one physics defying set piece after another all i can say is that i am now dreading part six and looking to part seven with something resembling vague optimism  especially if all involved can use the time to steal a better and tighter plot along the way the more outrageous it becomes the more impossible the film is to criticize there s good stuff  but it s the weakest of the  fast  films something like ocean s eleven and its various numerations  except with muscle cars and knuckleheads and without the laughs if you re in the mood for the cinematic equivalent of sugar and trans fats  the film delivers with one physics defying set piece after another treats interpersonal bonds as a concept that it knows about but can t quite come to grips with  considering all the horsepower and crashes upon which it would rather focus a slam bang start to the summer  sure  it s supposed to just be a silly popcorn movie  but treating these cardboard cutouts as people to admire and care about is dishonest and contemptible  that the movie sucks besides is the final insult the film gets much better in its second half when it becomes an  ocean s eleven  type adventure featuring many faces that will instantly be familiar to  fast furious  fans  gets lots of mileage from a combination of high spirits  scorn for the laws of physics  readily renewable energy and an emphasis on family values    not those of the nuclear family  but of hell raising  drag racing outlaws   ignoring the rules of physics doesn t make a movie more entertaining  it merely makes the writing easier  if a screenplay can cheat at any time  it encourages sloppy authorship it s when the action slows down that you can feel the brain cells dying the series takes the curious  surprising and rather brave route of ditching the street racing shenanigans that defined the series in favor of a more standard action oriented plot  it s an interesting approach  but the series  shallowness remainsa movie with exploding toilets  cars that move sideways and a big chase sequence with walker and brewster fleeing favela goons by crashing through the tin roofs of shanty town shacks who knew the fourth sequel to the fast and the furious would not only refuel a flagging franchise  but lead the pack as the best of the bunch who knew that the best place to put vin diesel would be between the rock and a hard place  the spot has never been tighter  or righter  and the testosterone never higher than in the hot jacking action of  fast five as a moviegoer  there are times when you want  say   jane eyre   and then there are times when a movie about really large men who drive cars really fast is just the thing   fast five  is that latter movie  and then some all the characters from the prior four fast and furious films are rounded up to do their own grease monkey version of  ocean s eleven  by chris morgan s enjoyably ludicrous script  which  by right s  should have been called  toretto s ten   the ensemble cast creates a really fun atmosphere by embracing the blatant ridiculousness of the films  and isn t that what enjoying a big  dumb action movie is all about like a proper action sequel  it s bigger  louder  and sillier than its predecessors  but it s more streamlined  too  smartly dumping the tired underground racing angle in favor of a crisp  hugely satisfying ocean s eleven style heist movie  beyond implausible  but it works as a live action cartoon fast five   is  so far  the most honest hollywood movie of the year  it s also the most fun  fast five  will push all your action buttons  and some you haven t thought of  so what if you hate yourself in the morning it took ten years  but here  finally  is a worthwhile sequel to the fast and the furioushere s a popcorn flick strong enough for a man and gentle enough for a woman a giant overdose of testosterone mixed with soap opera for muscleheads and gearheads between this and last year s overlooked  faster   it s great to see the rock re embracing the action genre  and when his clobbering match with diesel finally happens  it s as outlandishly room wrecking as i d hoped defying laws of physics  laws of acting  and the law of diminishing returns  fast five delivers a ridiculously fun mix of motorized macho mayhem and multicultural bonding we will race cars  we will crash cars  and at some point  a large breasted woman in a low cut blouse will lean over an engine block in a free for all like this  where the laws of gravity and dictates of narrative logic are left to eat dust  it doesn t matter when anything takes place or why fast five  represents yankee ingenuity of the brutally stupid kind fast five is among the best fourth sequels ever   not exactly high praise but more than i expected to dish out patently absurd and yet wildly entertaining  a marked improvement over its excessively dour predecessor it isn t quite summer movie season yet  but fast five is already peeling down to its proverbial  sweat sodden muscle shirt in preparation  it s ready for anything the biggest  best and most furious fast of them all  the  fifth lap of the brainlessly macho series should please fans   while making everybody else wonder why these movies are sheer silliness  improbable roadway mayhem interspersed with obligatory fistfights and gunplay  all coated with a noxious layer of adolescent macho posturing well  it s a more fun trip to rio than rio  as the reckless flailing of a lot of meatheads  fast five is essentially a food fight with sloppy joes while dopey as ever  the fun factor has increased exponentially now that certain plot elements and subculture porn has been ditched to roughhouse in rio with a band of crooks who ve blossomed into a family now this is how you make a summer movie i wish i could say that fast five was the fastest  most furious movie of the series  and that there wouldn t be a faster  more furious movie all year  i have to be honest though  fast five just wasn t fast enough for me  and it s hardly furious at all heads into the garage for almost the entirety of its sluggish middle section  which turns into a second rate ocean s eleven style heist movie this episode has the highest velocity and lowest iq yet  see it on the biggest  loudest  dumbest screen you can find the film is basically ocean s fourteen starring a multiculti version of the cast of jersey shore pretty cars  prettier women  insanely absurd action that truly thrills even as it shatters all physical laws  and enough testosterone fueled violence to satisfy the most rabid wwe smackdown crowd if you liked any of the previous movies  you should be even more thrilled by what they ve done this time around with a lot more at play here in terms of storytelling for seeing gigantic men beat the hell out of one another and for leering at sexed up hotties zipping around on scooters you ll be hard pressed to find any film that s its equal   until fast six inspired action choreography  macho mentality  aggressive stunt work and nimble editing rule  despite a few sluggish moments  it had me and it left me all revved up as confident and charismatic as its lead characters and every bit as fun to be around    a film that s custom built to combine the swift horsepower of characters we like with the stylish chrome of fresh changes is a welcome pleasure  far less interested in vehicular craziness than the wisecracking repartee of its supporting specialists such was my  exfivement   i couldn t remember the last time i was on the edge of my seat during an action sequence like this fast paced and visually breathtaking showing improvement as action director  justin lin has made an unpretentious thrill ride of a movie  one of the few hollywood pics whose characters reflect america s multi racial composition when it s exciting  it is really exciting as usual  the film thrives on excess summer roars to a start with fast five which features some of the most spectacular action sequences seen on the screen in years it s not the sign of a particularly good film when the entire cast could be replaced by belligerent three year olds and you could expect most of the line readings to remain exactly the same fast five maintains the winning formula and underlines the sad fact that stars vin diesel and paul walker still have nothing better to do where there s demand  there s supply  and this franchise will shoot up the box office chart because it s undemanding and fiercely electrifying entertainment at the very least  petrol headed punters won t be left fuming by what whizzes past in a blur here with belief soundly suspended and your senses of sight and sound reeling under full frontal assault  this hybrid of action  chase movie sets the bar low   and clears it with ease starts well with dippily exciting action and daft dialogue  but outstays its welcome as it devolves into a deeply daft ocean s eleven riff the fast and furious roadshow isn t slowing down a bit in fast five  by most measures the best of the bunch  combining fresh casting choices  interesting rio locales and literally smashing bookended action sequences the on going storyline is now running on fumes  but when director justin lin cuts to the chase there s enough left in the tank for some spectacular vehicular mayhem there s something deeply unpleasant about this latest flick that prevented me from enjoying all the stuff blowing up real good    imagine robin hood nuking nottingham castle after tweaking the sheriff   somehow  lim manages to keep you pinned to the passenger seat for over two gas guzzling hours   with no perceptible drop in testosterone levels it s possibly the most brainless film of the year  until the third transformers film surfaces  that is fantastic fun this palpable nonsense  which has a plot that defies all but hollywood s logic  is so smartly produced and directed that even its inordinate length doesn t matter all that much the stony performances don t really matter  and neither does the blunt dialog  but it s still great fun make no mistake  this is no masterpiece of the dramatic arts but it is probably the best since the original  lean  spectacular  funny and slightly less risible than its predecessors attempts to add emotional depth are misguided  but this is an entertaining popcorn flick a huge letdown overlong but slick  this still gets away with simplistic dialogue and characters  perhaps because it doesn t take itself too seriously five films in and the fast and the furious franchise finally gets itself into gear with the wonderfully over the top fast five utterly preposterous  but this car crazy franchise is armor plated you d think the fast and the furious franchise would ve run out of gas by now  think again seriously fast driving  jaw dropping action  some unexpected twists and an audacious central heist with an extraordinary climactic sequenceslow and spurious nannannanit s a smart film and pure coen  it has a point  though some may contest it  but it s not a must see film for everyone so if you are a coen fan  don t take your grandmother  she will say it sucks  the coen brothers are back with a triumphant return to form no country for old men is a great return to form for the coens  even if you ve never been a big fan of theirs  it s a film you should see if you like a good thriller the film clearly and finally represents the mainstream success that has long eluded the coens  longtime fans  fear not  this is no sell out  there is still plenty of what the coens do best the coens have returned    full of talent   full review in spanish no country for old men is imbued with a dry  minimalist  almost crude style and forms a dark and violent universe that reveals the horror and moral rot rooted in american society   full review in spanish  the lack of respect for the body  the sheer bloody aftermath depresses me  yes  they may handle the killing with verve and ironic tension  but this is a coen brothers film too far     a perfect match of story and storyteller there s no denying the movie and this character s power to shake you  the implacable chigurh dominates the proceedings like no other coen villain before him one of the most thoughtful and startling snapshots of the human condition of the last ten years played by spanish actor javier bardem  chigurh is the most original bogeyman to bloody up the screen in a while the last word on the modern day western used to be peckinpah s  no country for old men is peckinpah gone post peckinpah from brutal start to ironic finish the movie s tension is constant i can t help feeling the film is ultimately hollow an exasperating and self defeating experience  rather like listening to a nymphomaniac extol the virtues of celibacy as much as the film is about bardem s even keeled determination    it s also about tommy lee jones  brilliantly characterized texas sheriff  who  faced with a trail of blood like he s never seen  wonders if he s still a match for a changing world  no country for old men is an action film both measured and grave  opening as a jim thompson esque crime saga set on the texan sands  but as it moves along the film acquires an allegorical depth this magnificent film represents the best work the coen brothers have done since fargo  like that classic this is a cold blooded thriller with a darkly humorous edge  no country for old men is a thoroughly compelling exercise in the cinema of suspense that proves the power of the old school thriller remains undiminished it s not a film that asks to be either liked or disliked  it just is  branding itself on to you like a heated iron don t be put off with all of the mentions of violence  yes  bloodletting is at the core of the movie  and the ending is as downbeat as the opening scenes  but  gosh  you know you have been to see a great film it s an instant classic  as thrilling as it is quiet and hypnotic  and all the more powerful for anchoring a story with essentially three characters  none of whom share the frame together  being  how they are  one small step behind the other seventy minutes into the film  there s a rude burst of mariachi music as the hero awakes    that wouldn t be worth noting  except that we suddenly realize that for the first tense  suspense filled hour of the film there has been no music at all there are constant twists and turns  eventually straining credulity  but there s also    and typically for the coens    a salutary quorum of absurdist dialogue  black humour and wryly memorable exchanges the suspense is killer  hitchcock would be sick with jealousy no country for old men is wide and dusty and terribly bleak  it s beautifully photographed and assembled  with great performances from its lead players and a number of welcome appearances by actors we haven t seen enough of lately javier bardem makes for a terrifying villain  he looks physically corrupt but seems every bit as relentless as the terminator  he s also believably  psychotically human the coens imbue this simple tale with their trademark quirkiness and wry humour i have never been so frustrated with a movie as i was with no country for old men  i hope i never am again death always gets the last laugh    and what makes the coens so remarkable is how they dare to cackle at the punch lines morose vagueness will get no country for old men called a classic  instead of what it is  an often effective but pompous grindhouser  its pretensions are so big  you couldn t fit them in texas i love this film only the coen brothers could make a film so impressively brutal and yet so understated as this  it helps that the set up is so fiendishly simple  blood simple  you might say so  yes  you should probably see no country for old men  even if it does bow out with a baffling little coda featuring an old timer s meditation on the fact that he s estranged from his father haunting  hard  bitten and absurdly involving spanish actor javier bardem should leave audiences gasping with his stone cold performance in the blood spattered saga no country for old men the movie rarely loses its grip and is a remarkable accomplishment the coen brothers  no country for old men is a rare example of a too faithful adaptation of a novel  one that stubbornly refuses to explore and expound upon what the text readily provides the cinematic american west is vast enough for us to fill with our imaginations  taking a simple shadow play and transforming it into an eternal campfire tale no country for old men is a great texas film  it is great unequivocally  but lone star pride is a rare opportunity in hollywood cormac mccarthy s amazing novel was blessed with a usually impossible faithful adaption that translated the power of the words and weaved them into cinema films this good come along once  maybe twice in a lifetime there s nothing extraordinary about no country for old men    except  of course  the spectacle of two great directors in total command of their craft a mostly absorbing tale of the hunter being subverted into the hunted  no country for old men deserves to be lauded for its gripping  relentless thrills rather than its flawed denouement this film truly belongs to javier bardem no country is a pitch perfect thriller that delivers the pleasurable fear and suspense expected of the genre even as it sends its conventions to the shredder mccarthy s bloody and beautiful novel comes to life under the coen s able touch the decade s most overrated movieonce you open pandora s box  there s simply no stopping the beasts that pour out what starts off as the best charles bronson movie not to star charles bronson ends up as a literary adaptation of a novel that thinks it means something or other no country for old men is the brothers at their most polished  austere  and humorless when you see no country for old men  leave your preconceptions at home  but bring your alfred hitchcock lenses  they re useful  no country for old men is a dazzling time bomb of a movie  it is an engrossing  brutal  nerve wracking moral talethe plot is adapted from cormac mccarthy s novel but seems ready made for the coens  putting them back on familiar stomping grounds  the hellish texas they showed us in their debut film  blood simple for a film that traffics in implacable malice  this movie remains remarkably grounded in the everyday ultimately  no country for old men is a very strong film that s just a couple of bad decisions away from being a masterpiece this is some of brolin s best work to date  though the film still belongs to bardem and jones  whose low key mannerisms are well suited to the coens  sensibilities mccarthy s ferocious tale gives the coens room to unleash their cinematic gifts  but keeps them from wandering too far afield and losing themselves in the marshes of technical prowess or easy irony although  no country for old men  is an exciting film  wise screen violence needs more emotional depth below surface technique not since fargo have the coen brothers made such a perfect movie why  joel and ethan  why did you have to ruin an almost flawless film with a terrible last scene i was a little worried when i went to see  no country for old men  because many people have been labeling it a masterpiece  but for once all the hype is warranted no country for old men is the kind of film that will only cement the opinion you already have about its uniquely eccentric makers  approach the ticket booth accordingly retains the coen brothers  trademark quirkiness  and it certainly goes all out  but it s also subtle in ways we haven t seen before the most fascinating element of the film is its formal linking of its multiple  no nonsense protagonists   blu ray review thank goodness that experiment in appeasing the commercial suit types is over and the quirky brothers are back to form with no country for old men  a dark and violent exploration of nature s hunt and the relevance of time the problem comes when we realize it s a tommy lee jones film and the title is more than just a random coincidence  it s a really good film that was almost great    the coens sabotage their wonderfully understated style in no country with the trivial substance of their narrative this is the coens  masterful return to blood simple territory  the biggest thing you ll notice is the quiet  whether it s the lack of a soundtrack or a lack of dialogue  the silence often makes the tension unbearable what is perhaps most amazing is that a film this terrifying  violent and relentlessly nihilistic should also be this enthralling javier bardem s chigurh is the embodiment of sheriff bell s exasperation    a mythological  grim reaper like figure whose existence makes order and civility implausible chockful of suspense the coens stir up more panic by quietly flicking off a light switch than michael bay did with a fleet of decepticons it s jones who carries the film s meaning  and does so effortlessly  he    and the coens    have never been better good fortune found is always promising before bad fortune comes looking for it i m a big fan of the coens  but  i ve got to say  i m not much appreciating this picture sure to wow the critics  but no movie for the masses virtuoso  a film of pin sharp principles  cross hair precision and suffocating tension  this coens stunner hits like a cattle gun between the eyes is it a masterpiece  not even close watching this film has something of the elemental thrill of watching a cloud shadow spread with miraculous speed over a vast  empty landscape  it has a chilly  portentous intuition of what america is with its sly wit  dark intelligence and tense action sequences this film re establishes the coens as two of american cinema s most talented directors  it s also the best adaptation of mccarthy s work to date and an unmissable crime movie the coen brothers have once again placed themselves at the very forefront of american cinema a masterly tale of the good  the deranged and the doomed that inflects the raw violence of the west with a wry acknowledgement of the demise of codes of honour  this is frighteningly intelligent and imaginative violent  poetic  gripping  thrilling and blackly funny  that ll be the coens doing what they do best then  now with added humanity terrifically acted  superbly written and masterfully directed by the coen brothers  this is an incredibly suspenseful thriller that looks set for oscar glory come february it is a bloody and grisly film at times  but this is one of those few times where the violence and gore are not just necessary but essential  on first viewing its simply thrilling  on subsequent viewing i get the feeling this will only grow in estimation creepy time down south the coens have given us a film so unlike anything they ve made before  and in doing so  they ve given us a work of complete  devastating brilliance while watching it  i kept thinking i have finally seen it   the clear best film of the year  then the film gets to a critical point and literally stops wildly overpraised  but a solid return to form for the coen bros no country is not a film for weak  unsteady hearts i think this just might be  the coens   best film so far  with some qualifications an utterly enormous piece of filmmaking   this anti western set in the dusty southwest is pretty good for the first two acts  but burns out well before the end no country for old men is the most brutal cinematic experience of the year  as well as one the best  it s nothing shy of an unforgettable masterpiece it s the unexpected nature of the characters and what happens to them that makes this return to form from the coen brothers both intriguing and satisfying a film whose long  twisted narrative roads  rather than converging on some obvious  hackneyed point of closure  instead open out to infinite horizons examines a soulless america that can t live with or without violence how much does chance play in our clashes with evil  if that s too philosophical for you  then  pardner  you d best turn to entertainment other than  no country for old men   arguably the best yet from the coen brothers  adult  sophisticated  and often ambballoons don t blow into funny shapes  and its narrative direction isn t fairly self explanatory  yet to watch it is to gaze at the chilling  pitch black flipside of  raising arizona   and be haunted by penetrating  unflinching stares it gives back the duo may have created their most accomplished and compelling movie to date no country for old men is a modern american masterpiece  a film of unbridled power and purpose another fascinating and unpredictable character driven movie from the coen brothers i treasure movies such as this   movies that put you in a location  allow you to soak up the details  and constantly take you places you don t anticipate going  no country for old men is a masterpiece joel and ethan coen have a great catalog of films behind them  but they paint their masterpiece with no country for old men imagine  if you will  that you are on an amazing vacation  one for the ages  then  on the last day   you are mugged  no matter what transpired before  the trip is tainted an extremely tense exercise it s the kind of movie that cries out for a second look  because it s easy to admire  hard to actually like and harder still to penetratea brutal and violent film that breaks some of the rules that we expect from crime thrillers  no country is gripping  but it goes for the gut instead of the head javier bardem steals the show as perhaps the most unnerving screen villain of the year  a monster who ups the ante in terms of tension by holding a cattle gun to his victims  heads while flipping a coin to determine who lives and who dies this is the blackest film noir in years  and a great american movie a nail biting masterpiece of suspense  operating on a philosophical level that is as sophisticated as it is compellingalmost the best movie of the year javier bardem s sadistic fiend has got to be the most ghoulish homicidal maniac around since jack the ripper it proves  the coens  can hold an audience in thrall with the simplest of cinema s elements  a memorable image    a thoughtful  mature and earnestly meant work about the essential problem of being human   the suspicion that this is all there is  and that all our noble ideas about honor and decency  about right and wrong  matter not at all to darkening sky andthe film is a slow burn  not building  not petering out  just becoming gradually more nerve wracking as each plot point makes itself known  astounding sound design by craig berkey no country for old men isn t the first great movie certain to have its ending criticized even by many who enjoyed the rest of the picture and boy howdy  does that dialogue howl like a basset hound pup who s just been yanked from his momma with  no country for old men   the brothers coen return to texas    and to form the coens load the film with realistic touches that add grit and meaning to the almost mythical plot joel and ethan coen  working from a novel by cormac mccarthy  have made one of the darkest and best movies of the year with no country for old men the coens may have made their ultimate statement  you may not agree with their pessimism  but they so effectively tell their story that you cannot help but be swept up in their vision not satisfied with just being one of the best thrillers i ve ever seen   no country of old men  goes beyond that in its third act to becoming a haunting and unforgettable american classic bardem  as the man with the odd  long  bowl cut pageboy hair and a powerful air compressor that a lesser murderer might give a cute nickname to  is the single most chilling human being to inhabit a movie about death in texas since leatherface this stark and grimly violent tale of humankind s insignificance in the presence of a force it is helpless to control or predict is a morality tale of existential proportions    and with contemporary implications with its dizzying alternations of comedy and horror  the film is unmistakably a coen brothers movie    albeit a much better one than they ve made in a while holds up against the coens  earlier genre masterpieces like miller s crossing and fargo i would have preferred a bit more resolution  but it s hard to fault the filmmakers for sticking to their filmic styleno country for old men isn t quite a masterpiece  it s simply an exercise in fine craftsmanship  whose craftsmen suit each other superbly don t believe the hype  the most unsatisfying conclusion to a film since the final episode of  the sopranos   and that which led up to it wasn t so great either people are calling it the best film of the year  and if it isn t  it s darn close let me just say up front what a pleasure it is to watch a well crafted film in which not a word or a gesture is wasted a world of bad men that s easy to get trapped in and impossible to escape fromno country for old men looks into the unfathomable depths of evil and poses existential questions about human destiny  meanwhile  it takes your breath away this is as good a chase thriller as you could want a rare instance of great american filmmakers taking on a great american book  and winning joel and ethan coen have directed their best film since fargo more than a decade ago this isn t just another notch on the coen brothers  amazing career of exquisitely crafted crime dramas  it s an instant american classic  and the first truly must see awards contender of the year there are still a lot of good movies slated for november and december  but it s hard to imagine anything topping the coen brothers  chiller thriller no country for old men murder for its own sake wears quickly on me and i found myself wanting to flee the theater  and the sooner the better what makes the movie a masterpiece  however  is not the coens  supreme command of their craft in these scenes  but their willingness to embrace the resigned worldview of mccarthy s novel  it  just might be the coen brothers  singular mythic masterwork a cold  rough look at the dissolution of just about everything  it will bother you afterward  it should bardem is nothing less than the best movie villain since anthony hopkins slipped out of hannibal lecter s manacles  scary smart and horrifyingly appealing  and brolin is nothing short of a revelation this movie is that stunning the desert is as cold and bleak as mccarthy s view of humanity  so the laughs may not dare even leave your throat the storytelling is fluid  especially when directors joel and ethan coen start eliding some of the murders and ask us to imagine them for ourselves the mood is darker and quieter than the coens usually present  though some of the dialogue has a deadpan humor working from a cormac mccarthy novel that has the heedless  headlong force of an action movie screenplay  joel and ethan coen have improved upon the original by giving it a visual lyricism to match mccarthy s verbal barrage filmmakers joel and ethan coen build and sustain tension so masterfully throughout this adaptation of cormac mccarthy s novel that even trouble that s been telegraphed still shocks when it arrives a muscular  exact and thrillingly cool movie the coen brothers  best movie  hands down  is a chase film in which all the characters scatter their essences as they run shockingly effective and incomprehensibly great  no country for old men proves that the coen brothers are america s reigning motion picture gods it s as close to a perfect film as i ve seen all year  ingeniously crafted  thematically consistent  and haunting in its implications this is intense  provocative filmmaking on every level that is sure to be one of the best american films of the year     strong  evocative storytelling pared to the bone and braced with a sensibility perfectly matched to the material  n o coen human low pressure system yet has been anything like the nightmare of centered psychosis that is javier bardem s anton chigurh the story is vintage mccarthy in its sense of place and its poetic voice  and it is vintage coens for some of those same traits  and its cruel  graphic violence this coen brothers adaptation of the cormac mccarthy novel may be their darkest film yet  it s also one of their best it s been six years and two movies since the coen brothers directed a feature that didn t embarrass the memory of everything else they ve ever made  but  with no country for old men  the writing directing duo are back to old form call it terrifying  stunningly bleak  humane  epic  intimate  darkly funny  deadly serious  or what have you  whatever laudatory adjectives you throw its way are going to stick the film leaves you to figure whether such perception is real  anton is random  or carla jean sees something about the  country  the men cannot the coens return to form  creating their most idiosyncratic characters since steve buscemi s carl showalter faced down the wood chipper in fargo let s just say it s all amazing  no country for old men is exactly the kind of challenge film buffs will love if you re sick of the by the numbers  multiplex drivel the hype was right  no country for old men is basically flawless the coens are wintry and dead calm ironists  and their movie is finally less an assault on our sensibilities than a subtle    and possibly permanent    insinuation into our consciousnesses if nothing else  no country should win an award for best use of an oxygen tank if you re not looking for a  fargo  level masterpiece but just for a badass modern western  it delivers plenty on that level tommy lee jones combines forces with the coen brothers in the unforgiving winds of the west texas prairie  javier barden s psycho killer and the coens  creepy direction and screenwriting pops out the grittiest film of the year the coens return to their darker  earlier days and brolin and bardem deliver terrific performances after two artistic flops  it appeared that filmmakers joel and ethan coen had taken a fall  not so  they re back with their twelfth and perhaps greatest film the coen brothers make the same old story exciting again by telling the entire story in action  nobody explains their plans  they just see what they have to do and do it  it s all clear  and it s never slow a great american film  a dark and sometimes bleakly comic vision of our violent culture no country for old men may just be the year s best picture this country is for anyone who loves movies the coen brothers  screenplay is faithful to mccarthy without being obsequious  in filming it  they play it straight  and the touches of signature humor that are there don t seem like flashes of style  but organic and right no country for old men is based on a novel by cormac mccarthy  but it shows all the coen strengths  one is a genuine interest in the way people work deeper  funnier and even stranger than fargo no country for old men is the first movie i ve seen in a very long while that deserves to be called a masterpiece  it s such a stunning achievement in storytelling the film is as lean and mean as a barbed wire necktie  darkly funny and much deeper than the average crime thriller it s grim  unforgiving and probably unforgettable    in some ways you ll want to remember  and in others you may wish you couldn t both perplexing and engrossing as it explores humanity s animal instincts  this being mccarthy and the coens  nothing is spelled out  the seeds are there and they will flourish in a fertile mind there isn t a performance in this film that isn t exquisitely in key or a frame in this film that doesn t feel right  at times  the movie deliberately leaves us grasping to understand what we ve seen the coens are geniuses at creating tension through editing  no country has craft and atmosphere aplenty as pure craftsmanship  no country for old men is as good as we ve ever gotten from joel and ethan coen with stunning landscapes around the tex mex border shot by roger deakins and the elements of pursuit and retribution  the saga draws from the western tradition in which the characters become dwarfed by nature the coens understand the stark immediacy of this tale  and they visualize it with brilliantly judged details an intense  nihilistic thriller as well as a model of implacable storytelling  this is a film you can t stop watching even though you very much wish you could the coen brothers   shape the parched  timeless tex mex borderland into a character itself  a place where good and evil alike swelter under the sun  and the prairie wind whistles by uncaring most audiences will look at the film and see only the simple plot of a fugitive and his two pursuers  but is there more being said and more being asked within the wide open spaces of no country for old men  indisputably it s almost too good to be true that the coen brothers have adapted mccarthy s novel and brought it to the screen  though it is their bleakest work to date indeed  within the framework of this film it truly is no country for old men  and as that harsh realization presents itself the only emotion left is a form of quietly overpowering devastation the tension of being around a psycho killer like anton keeps you on the edge of your seat  with the much needed relief coming in the brand of humor that only the coen brothers can deliver in almost seven years as a critic  i have never said this within a review  and here it is  this film is a masterpiece no country for old men is as good a film as the coen brothers  joel and ethan  have ever made  and they made fargo an eerily quiet  bracingly bloody  and expertly laid out adaptation of the cormac mccarthy novel the simple saga of two tough hombres  a bag of money and everybody unlucky enough to get in their way blossoms into something far more delicate  contemplative and almost mythical brutal and intense  it s an enigmatic  metaphysical mindgame it s a localized scenario  but what the movie skillfully does is increase its philosophical scale ever so slowly the coens have left all their tricks and ironic jokery behind and the resulting film feels deeper and more personally felt than anything they have done before the coens have found the perfect source material to continue their dominance of the crime genre while making a second viewing an absolute must to appreciate all the voices involved the neo western byproduct of a deranged and adrift zeitgeistthis is the best film the coen brothers have done since their glory days of fargo and the big lebowski  maybe the best they ve done  period cormac mccarthy s book about a man who finds a case full of money at the scene of a drug deal gone very  very wrong is ideally suited for the coen brother s understated talk and striking visuals    an elegy for an american way of life that may make liberals side with the old el paso sheriff who bemoans today s youth with their drugs and green hair  it s a texan lament not heard since the last picture show the coen brothers  once again  prove they are an american asset to film for formalists    those moviegoers sent into raptures by tight editing  nimble camera work and faultless sound design    no country for old men is pure heaven it thunders with the mordant wit  blood soaked pessimism  and human folly that mark their unique auteurial stamp the result  while it may be their most ambitious and successful film in years  remains just a coen brothers movie  a curio to collect rather than an experience to remember bardem s unnerving performance is the one that will stay with you a whip smart  fingernail chewing creation that crackles with tension and is pocked with thrilling incarnations of evil  it makes the standard issue nightmare seem like a tropical vacation this acerbic  darkly poetic coen brothers  take on the cormac mccarthy novel is calculated to give you the willies no country for old men bears mccarthy s unmistakable stamp  and the equally unmistakable mark of filmmakers joel and ethan coen  making a strong return after a few years off like the best of alfred hitchcock  it s easy to imagine the movie casting its sinister spell on audiences for years to come i just don t like it very much     edge of the seat suspenseful so ferociously acted and executed that it practically takes a bite out of you  you won t believe how great it is long the merry pranksters of the cinema  the coens have given irony a vacation it s their best work in a while and it s probably going to end up being the year s best movie this measured yet excitingly tense  violent yet maturely sorrowful thriller marks the first time the filmmakers have faithfully adapted somebody else s work to their own specifications and considerable strengths the ending is so lame it made me feverish  then i remembered the perfection that came before it  and concluded that this is  without question  the best movie ever made by the eccentric coen brothers this is the coen brothers  leanest and least affected film since blood simple bleak but beautiful  and with characteristic coen shafts of gallows humor    about as perfect as a film can get   a shocking and mesmerizing experience the coens know how a thing or two about pacing  and it s relentless here  the story is full of unexpected twists and switchbacks  and opportunities for the audience to gear down and take a breath are few and far between this film is an evil delight  adapted from cormack mccarthy s book  it s filled with suspense  pitch black humor and one of the most memorable villains in recent cinema while no country for old men is compelling from beginning to end  the film lacks soul a return to glory for the coen brothers  a revisiting of the formula that worked so well for them in fargo  but with a darker  more cynical twist if i want wry lawmen and smart  calculating fugitives  i ll get them from elmore leonard  and  if i want leonard  i ll take him neat  rather than slow filtered  drop by drop  through a layer of faulkner  then laced with the book of jeremiah here s the gist  it s a near masterpiece the coens squeeze us without mercy in a vise of tension and suspense  but only to force us to look into an abyss of our own making like the crying game  pulp fiction and other films that shift paradigms in mid stream  there s more happening than meets the eye    stark and spare  it s often a gasp inducing  armrest clutching experience audience members who found previous coen brothers  works too precious can rejoice in this  their best film  close to an american masterwork a dust bowl pulp fiction  the movie is bloody  suspenseful  unnerving and  not incidentally  hilarious  the best coen bros  drama  without the twitchy mannerisms of fargo a cormac mccarthy horror mystery with all its ingenuity and without hollywood compromise  happily for literature  the movie retains the fright and power of the novel with its shock ending i may be clearly in the minority on this movie  it will almost certainly be number one on my list of movies that other people liked and i didn t the film is powerhouse genre  touching in its strange  graceful arc towards total resignation  and tinged  as the best and purest of all american genre films are   the coens  first film since their leaden remake of the ladykillers is an exceptional return to their blood simple roots  offering up a crime saga in which money is almost as irresistible as bad choices are inevitable against the whisper of wind and buzz of flies  the coens manage to find tension in the subtlest of movements and cut the dialogue through with humour as arid as the landscape jones graces the film like an elder statesman a quirky and bloody meditation on the rising tide of violence in america by the coen brothers feels less like a breathing  thinking movie than an exercise  that may be partly because it s an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who s usually spoken of in hushed  respectful  hat in hand tones the most searing film i ve seen this year in adapting this most un coen like material  the brothers have come up with a winner  an action film with a serious philosophical undertone the coen brothers have gotten their mojo back with the help of cormac mccarthy this is one of  the coens   best films  yet  its indelible images resonating long after the final credits roll it could serve as a model of prose to film adaptation  choosing exactly the right moments and movements for the picture  and leaving alone others that are better suited to literature no country for old men is a strong addition to the coen bros  shelf and will certainly please fans of crime stories while exciting action aficionados  and both groups will chuckle more than once it s the coen s masterpiece a terrific return to form on a par with fargo and other coen classics this is a film that pulls no punches   it s brutal  violent and at times perverse  it is almost sadistic in how it removes all sense of catharsis from the audience  yet does so with such grace and efficiency that you re constantly shaking your head in amawritten almost exclusively in taut dialogue  the book already reads like a screenplay  and the coen brothers have taken full advantage a stark modern day western featuring javier bardem as the creepiest movie psycho this side of anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs the most ambitious and impressive coen film in at least a decade  featuring the flat  sun blasted landscapes of west texas and an eerily memorable performance by javier bardem no country delivers  with suspense scenes as taut as they are acutely observed in a sense  the film is a lament for old certainties which are cruelly swept aside  perhaps purged would be more accurate  by bardem s extraordinary monster there is a positively chilling performance from javier bardem as an embodiment of human evil to match dennis hopper s memorable turn in blue velvet a brilliant example of how plot devices as simple as murder and money can be used to explore larger sweeping themes of mortality  morality and more    while still delivering rousing  intelligent pure entertainment the coens  typically superior filmmaking sustains the electrifying mood for most of the picture  but they are undone by being too faithful to the source novel by cormac mccarthy a scorching blast of tense genre filmmaking shot through with rich veins of melancholy  down home philosophy and dark  dark humor brilliant from first frame to last  this faithful adaptation of mccarthy s novel is the coen brothers best film to date  a masterpiece that s mesmerizing as a thriller and meditation on the nature of violence in america bateman  whose name is usually mud when it comes to appearing in good movies  brings out the best in smith the actor and the action becomes surprisingly fresh and funny   at first  hancock is great fun  quirky and hilarious    smith especially proves every minute why he s become the best in hollywood  then the movie takes an odd turn and goes into a whole other story  with different    and deeper  i guess    meanings     the tape is an excellent way to have fun  without question   full review in spanish hancock is funny and pretty fresh but finally gives up on idiosyncrasy  leaving you nothing much to discover and if you re still not willing to forgive hancock  and least there is the scene where he shoves a guy s head up another guy s butt hancock is what happens when you have talented people working on quality material  it s really a no brainer that it works so well  kicks into tired oh it sucks to have superpowers territory and opens up a can of racial issues it has no intention of investigatingi have no problem signing on to recommend this  get it  signing on   john hancock    nevermind a few actors such as clint eastwood  marry substance and popularity  but very few  most actors  egos lead them to slum in the box office  i m reminded of this often when a major  talented actor opts for popularity instead of substance when the latter beck   an engaging and thoroughly innovative spin on the superhero genre   this is a different take on the superhero genre with an interesting  offbeat twist a fun  fairly crisp opening hour gives way to a muddled  entirely unsatisfying ending the trouble with hancock is that its wry  reflexive commentary on the pressure of being will smith gets lost in the more typical reflexivity of the big budget hollywood fiasco the strain of messianism in will smith movies is becoming ever more pronounced it becomes an entirely different film  one not really premised on the bad superhero comedy idea  and the film is then oddly without a sense of humour  and its vague interest in satire vanishes completely a relatively satisfying ending that leaves just enough of an opening to warrant a sequel if the box office receipts are right train wrecks are intrinsically spectacular  and will smith s new movie offers a doozy  two of them  in fact smith and bateman are great  and the first half of the movie is terrific  the second half   well  you ll either go with it or you won t will smith  fourth of july  superhero  it all seems to add up to a great combination  but they only made half a film while the film never quite reaches an alan moore level deconstruction of the superhero mythos  it has a fun time offering up all the joy of a big budget action movie without taking things too seriously the most adult of the new wave of superhero dramas has plenty of funny  even tender moments until it veers in a different  messy direction an hour in it s let down by a disappointingly uneven plot  painfully underwritten characters and dodgy effects it s definitely a mish mash  but really good performances squeezing every bit of originality out of its concept  hancock fails on so many levels that it s surprising the film isn t a bigger success with audiences less like a complete movie  hancock plays out more like the first two episodes of a television series shown back to back most of hancock s faults can be forgiven because will smith creates a quintessentially american hero  flawed  frayed  but always sacrificing for the sake of others hancock suggests the colin powell  pottery barn  argument  but before it gets really interesting  veers wildly off course hancock is a movie that tosses the genre cookie cutter under the bus hancock isn t by any means a dead loss  but it could have been a lot better it s a pointless  plodding and just plain ugly effort which fails on just about every level the phony mythos turns into equally spurious pathos that plays like bathos because not one iota of the sentiment or sympathy has been earned smith s invincibilty at the box office may come down  for this film is a mess  not even his charm and personality can save this train wreck there are more problems afoot than just its misleading rating  beginning with the story itself the structure of hancock is a bold risk that supplies more storytelling ambition than your more typical summer popcorn blockbuster hancock tries to reinvent the superhero movie   until it loses interest in its own story after a frenetic and funny first half   hancock  falls apart  devolving into a sentimentalized and scattershot piece short on integrity and sense it feels like a couple of reels are missing    devoting an enjoyable first hour to our dirtbag crusader s unlikable antiheroics  before jumping to the conclusion without benefit of a second act it s certainly the most complexly ornery superhero flick we re likely to get this summer the special effects feel rather synthetic for a big time summer blockbuster  when the smoke finally clears hancock emerges as just another routine riff on the superhero genrean interesting idea  but it falls a bit short of being a compelling story while by no means a perfect film  i still found a lot to enjoy here  there have been at least two dozen superhero movies in the last six or seven years  it s kind of nice to see one that looks at things from the other side of the coin an unfocused  ill conceived  and rather ridiculous smith vehicle   a disappointing mishmash     the bottom line is that  as far as botched movies go  hancock is a painless way to pass a couple of hours enjoying a mindless summer popcorn movie    a tale of redemption hard won  and all the more rewarding for that morally bankrupt  and this is coming from someone who thinks ted bundy was misunderstood the acting matches the actionthe more we get to know about hancock and how he acquired his name and mysterious powers  the less entertaining it becomes there are lots of interesting ideas and some fine work on display  but it never gels into a fully satisfying movie experience  like its titular super anti hero  it only works sometimes the dynamic between the sullen smith and sincere bateman may be the best thing in the peter berg s movie  but it s a tough call because the whole popcorn fest is flat out fantastic see saws between straight superhero movie and parody  with layers of soap opera fudge in between  a lot of solid scenes   but hancock lacks the power of super coherence his symbol is the eagle  he beats up on little frenchmen  he is  the only one of my kind   the world s lone and lonely superpower  hancock is a clever metaphor for america in the world here s a movie filled with bright ideas  crammed uncomfortably into a story burdened by confusing and often contradictory exposition about halfway through the film it shifts gears    one wishes  they  had focused on a single story and saw it through a superhero movie with soul  a magically endowed boozer  and quirky chemistry fueled between those two dramatic heavyweights  will smith and charlize theron  who go at it like hillary and obama duking it out at a presidential primary this summer has been defined  over and over  by boys maturing into men    hancock is by far the most thoughtful exploration of this issue fate  mythology and even racism in america are tossed in to a climax so grim it s like watching  men in black  morph into  requiem for a dream   the movie doesn t earn that drama  feeling cobbled together from earlier  less commercial drafts a peculiar and occasionally charming poke in the ribs of the superman myth as popcorn movies go  this is fleet  funny  and even thoughtful  its central question  nicely underplayed by director peter berg  is why power and altruism never seem to intersect why on earth anyone would want to waste a summer matinee afternoon with hancock when they could get wasted with shakes the clown in the dvd privacy of their own lair while not a total failure  what would the result have been had director peter berg been able decide what he wanted his movie to be  as it stands  hancock is a wildly uneven ho hum affair that really should ve have been much more hancock  is a mess of a movie  a bizarre combination  believe it or not  of  my super ex girlfriend  and  breaking the waves the shaking and almost random cutting destroy the movie s timing and humor  though smith is skilled enough to sneak a few laughs through feels like they shot the story treatment without ever bothering to turn it into a screenplay    the film is full of empty patches  not plot holes exactly  but spots where it seems we aren t getting a full movie  a bout three fifths of the way in  things take a sudden turn    while this switcheroo has put off many critics  it is precisely what i found most interesting   something big and different during that time of the year when something big and different is so rare it s like dating britney spears  too much drama a slightly messy movie  but it s also one of the year s best don t expect to laugh more than five times and you won t be disappointed hancock is not the light and fluffy comedy you may think it is   it s dark and coarse  but well worth checking out hancock is a rarity  it s an action yarn that feels like a drama and  alternately  a drama that takes our breath away with bursts of eye popping action i m willing to give a superhero film some leeway in terms of realism but a film has to remain true to its own inner logic and this one keeps changing the ground rules the problem is that director peter berg  aided and abetted by smith and theron and third banana jason bateman  seem to have made it literally  not realizing its out of whack tonalities and grotesque plot twists were meant to be played for laughs the good cast does what it can with the weak material  but the waste of talent only makes the film s total failure that much more regrettable hancock leaps fluidly from comedy to action to romance  and it has bigger surprises in store as soon as the hero becomes another wounded demigod brooding on rooftops  the movie loses its sting ill conceived and oddly executed  this will smith vehicle perplexes more often than it entertains hancock makes for one unexpectedly satisfying and kinky addition to hollywood s superhero chronicles there s a great idea here  but it s buried within a muddled story that lurches between dark comedy and maudlin drama drunk superhero comedy turns into     something else  not all that successfully hancock can fly  hancock can punch  hancock is bulletproof  regrettably these things don t hold true for hancock as a film  which starts promisingly enough  but ultimately gets knocked off course by a reveal of dubious dramatic value since the pursuit of happyness  actor producer smith has made no secret of his desire to make movies that entertain in that big studio way but also dig deeper  hancock is a rousing measure of that intent     in spite of its flaws  i very much enjoyed hancock  for both its interesting and creative storytelling and smith s great lead performance a floundering action comedy with an interesting premise that self destructs in its second half as delivered by director peter berg  hancock is never as serious or funny or poignant as it could be  and despite clocking in at a reasonable running time  it has a big sag in the middle that nothing could have fixed audience members willing to hop aboard this emotional roller coaster ride will respond to the resultant pathos far better than viewers wondering why the laughs suddenly went mia will smith and a great cast are not enough to keep this from becoming a soaring disappointment in this summer s superhero movie sweepstakes a few more films like these  and this will be remembered as the beginning of the end of his blockbuster career hancock  is not a bad movie  just an underachieving one  it lacks a  wow  factor  it is bland and routine and flies off in too many directions hancock is an irreverent hero for our times  perhaps reflecting our own national zeitgeist  with america s previously untainted superpower image suddenly a matter of debate rather than fact     where  director peter  berg makes it work is by refusing to sacrifice the integrity of his characters for an easy ending hancock is still a lot of fun  will smith remains one of the most likable of movie stars  and he s a virtuoso of underplayed sarcasm has action  heart  but superhero is an alcoholic the tragedy of  hancock  is that will smith is so damn good in it yet because it s smith  you know that hancock can t be all bad  and as the film spends the next hour trying to rehabilitate him  proceedings slowly starts to fall apart john hancock is a black superhero desired and derided by crowds who are informed by spectacles  stereotypes  and fear      it s always nice to see someone revisit christopher reeves  drunken man of steel act from superman iii if hancock didn t try so hard to be  edgy  and  different  it could have been a winner  instead with the only villain in the movie being a whiskey bottle it barely registers as a blip on the radar hancock is a mess that isn t even fun to enjoy for its little pleasures flashy and funny  but extremely uneven  this superhero action comedy lets its gifted cast stroll through a series of ill defined charactersas daring and audacious as its eponymous hero  venturing into realms of mythos and sentiment with equal dexterity and eruditionhancock is either a brilliant disaster or an often uneven masterwork only half a good movie    the whole of it becomes confusing  disappointing  and non sensical even smith needs good material  and it s fitfully supplied here this antihero merely spreads his suckage filmwide has a promising premise remember wild wild west  well   a promising idea about a superhero with an existential crisis wobbles through wildly misjudged moments and then has something of an existential crisis of its own best as a comedy and worst when it tries to get serious it doesn t take itself as seriously as it should  and undercuts a final act that should have and so could have packed a mighty emotional wallop despite having a few  wow  moments  this is one of the more frustratingly inconsistent movies in recent memory part of the joke lies in seeing a megawatt star embrace his inner grouch with fantastical blunders  and part of the anticipation lies in seeing hancock become  well  will smith to be sure  hancock mines the superhero mythology and pays homage to the rich folklore on which it feeds and sustains itself  but what it does with the raw materials is thoroughly  refreshingly unique no one can tell a coherent story anymore  and before long no one will notice setting out to be both a parody and the very thing that it s parodying  the movie comes up short on both accounts a new movie that makes the previous pandemonium seem downright restrained there were many moments where i was going from nail biting to knee slapping director peter berg knows the difference between cartoon violence and the real stuff  and hancock mixes both to good effect you have to admire any summer blockbuster that freshens and subverts the superhero genre  and you re in fine hands with these actors it s worth it just to see a ready made superman sized superhero in action without all the baggage of decades of retellings and reworkings  even looking at familiar faces working through a familiar genre  it s nice to be surprised for once smith s pictures deliver familiar pleasures  they work with efficiency but not inspiration  honoring the time honored movie platitudes that will neither shock nor stretch an audience hancock the jaunty  jokey riff on the screwed up inner emotional life of a traditionally ironclad superhero becomes hancock the icky lesson in the importance of personal responsibility  loyalty  and continued family togetherness credit must be paid to director peter berg for pulling off such a tricky balance of such diverse elements while delivering an impressive and affecting superhero adventure with as much heart and soul as sound and fury but for most of its running time  hancock is a refreshing piece of cinema that should be another solid summer hit for smith hancock is a giant mess of a movie  it s not just misguided  it s insulting there are some moments when it looks as though it is somehow going to work but then  much like its anti hero  it comes crashing back to earth  leaving nothing behind of note besides a giant mess the attempts to deepen the emotions turn hancock into a strange  conflicted and often joyless film there s a game changing plot twist that is at first fascinating  but ultimately infuriating because the movie never capitalizes on it a fascinating film about exploitation as it applies to blacks and the entertainment industry while hancock certainly isn t lacking in ambition  unfortunately it does lack coherence between the jittery pseudo realism of peter berg s direction and the maudlin undercurrent to its hero s redemption  all hancock can summon up is the faintest sensation of nausea another great departure for smith to put his charm and popularity to the test  offering more than a few solid laughs within an original superhero premise the bottom line  of course  is will smith who carries the film and salvages things even while the story falls apart all around him  the guy has charisma to burn  and makes hancock appealingmost of the film is zippy  funny  and fascinatingly strange    all qualities that are often lacking in some of the more bloated action blockbusters the superhero genre screams for a makeover  or at least a smart deconstruction  but hancock isn t that movie  it just ups the foolishness ante the strain of sadism that s crept into mainstream american movies eventually overtakes and undercuts hancock  which should embarrass the filmmakers  who pay lip service here to gooey idealism a strange but cool comedy even with smith s considerable charm and his proven track record as independence day weekend movie god  hancock doesn t succeed as a truly satisfying holiday movie blockbuster the second half gets so worked up over itself that hancock becomes nearly unrecognizable as the movie we were all enjoying twenty minutes earlier leaving behind the laughs for schmaltz  hancock chickens out at the last minute  lurching toward a cop out happy ending that gives every indication of having been reshot at the behest of test audiences  well  at least you won t be bored passable if profane  hancock chugs along right up to that when this comic superhero engine goes off the tracks  and pretty much off a cliff as for smith  he s on fire  there s nothing like a star shining on his highest beams  you follow him anywhere hancock is still worth seeing  if only for a glimpse of what might have been a truly innovative idea hancock is a lot of fun  if perhaps a little top heavy with stuff being destroyed initially  it seems like hancock is going to have some fun with the superhero paradigm  but this dark  muddled and tedious noise machine winds up being an inferior copy of that genre s highlights the basic truth everyone should know here is that  for all its savvy and slick promises otherwise  hancock is an empty  ill plotted and highly vulgar disaster that s going to disappoint virtually everyone who takes the time to see it a super dud the set up is there  but the big payoff is a huge letdown  smith  should have pushed for a rewrite as  hancock  only flies so far before degenerating into a lame and illogical  my super ex girlfriend in this highly superheroic summer of iron man and the forthcoming the dark knight  hancock can offer only an a list headliner in a d list project hancock is a film that starts off promisingly  but takes a left turn about halfway through and literally comes apart at the seams hancock is horrendously disjointed and barely manages to tell a story  but i was delighted by its charisma and will smith s unexpected middle finger timing hancock is a hodgepodge of intriguing ideas that  if developed further or presented as more than throw ins to a confused production  might have made for a unique superhero film a ton of potential  but ultimately a mess with great power comes great    irresponsibility part of smith and berg s subvert your expectations game plan involves a major midfilm shocker  one that takes the movie to larger mythological places unrelated to hancock s self improvement quest hancock is the sort of fourth of july cinematic fireworks celebration hollywood dreams about but rarely achieves thanks to smith  it s a story about movie stars    and why the multiplex going humankind needs to have them kicking around  too this superhero saga fizzles that pain in your neck is cinematic whiplash it s a strange feeling to see the summer s most promising premise self destruct into something bizarre and unsatisfying  but that is the hancock experience what does one say about a movie that wants laughs from a shot of one inmate s head up the derriere of another almost any moviegoer should be able to find something to enjoy  but it s hard to imagine anyone liking this mishmash from beginning to end what starts out with a sense of quirky fun loses direction and devolves into a mishmash of story lines the promise is dangled yet never developed  rather  the narrative slips into a backstory that alternates between confusing and contradictory the final third seems all shot in a strange blue light that makes even the gorgeous theron look consumptive  and is  in a nutshell  no fun at all  aren t fourth of july movies supposed to be fun  no fireworks this time  will it s the sort of role smith ought to be able to pull off easily  but even his superpowers apparently have their limits there are many joys to be found in hancock  not the least of which is smith s effortless performance   if you thought you were in for something light hearted  prepare yourself for more superhero angst than batman begins and hulk combined by the expedited conclusion it all feels less like a peter berg film and just another chapter in will smith s tentpole history of major creative failures director peter berg mounts a special effects extravaganza that s very boring indeed  and doesn t quite deafen us to the inadequacies of the script  while smith pretends to be a grumpy git but  naturally  winds up begging us to love him the filmmakers cannot resist embracing the conventions they were tweaking  hancock turns from a moody  darkly funny character piece trimmed out with a bit of engaging action and veers into a poor impersonation of a standard superhero movie hancock s light hearted comedic elements sit uncomfortably next to its more  adult  cussing and violence      hancock suggests new visual directions and emotional tonalities for pop  it s by far the most enjoyable big movie of the summer the action comedy  a biting satire of superhero mythology and the comedy that results from its real world applications  makes you love the guy for his brutally logical demeanor frenetic  forgettable and unfulfilling  even will smith looks uncharacteristically uncomfortable a bunch of strange  vague ideas crammed into a movie with nowhere to go and absolutely nothing to show us i love surprises and would happily be led up the garden path with will smith  but there s a fatal flaw to hancock  with alien sized plot holes and worse still  characters behaving out of context a clumsily executed  forgettable mess that s too dark for kids  too dull for teens and too dumb for adultssheds essential exposition in a mad  foolish dash to the finish line subtlety and nuance take a summer vacation sadly  the bar is set too high and the movie implodes under the weight of its own ambitions i m not so sure berg is losing faith that his audience can follow along   but in the face of so many comic book films entering theatres  it seems a poor choice to differentiate yours by way of tacky tv level antics smith clearly has fun sending up his image if will smith can pull off this hodgepodge of a movie  an ill conceived poorly executed effort that tries to be all things to all people  then he really is hollywood s most bankable star for a robust action story about three people from very different backgrounds attempting to make a positive influence on their world   hancock  is a step in the right direction this misguided attempt to wring a novel twist on the superhero genre has a certain whiff of the last action hero about it great concept  shaky execution there s enough good stuff to justify action fan attendance no surprise to me  because i fully expected it to be awesome nannannannannannannannannannana lazy little product of mediocrity that will be woefully outdated in the next year   high production values and seemingly endless celebrity cameos only moderately elevate the scattershot satire of the scary movie franchise in a quarter of a century who s even going to remember that tom cruise went on oprah s show and made an ass of himself a low brow comedy chock full of cheap laughs there are some laughs in this latest installment a film with more chuckles then guffaws  hopefully the producers will settle on better movies to make fun of next time around full review in greekit hits a few broad targets and misses many more  leaving the door open to continue the series indefinitely there is a certain slapdash energy and heedless silliness to the proceedings that is somewhat engaging  certainly more so than the hateful likes of date movie the humor is supposed to come from the recognition that another movie or entertainment world incident from the pages of us weekly is having fun poked at it this franchise will never make the history books  but  you know  if they have to keep coming  this is probably the best of the lot  with more laughs than you might expect too much potty humor    and not enough inspired comedy    sink this fourth installment in the sm franchise    most of it was unfunny   even  anna faris  must recognize that the series has turned into the cinematic equivalent of a flat bicycle tyre    it starts off with lots of air in it  but can quickly go flat when punctured some hearty laughs  but there s also a lot of effluence based humor to wade through this time out  what s scary is how boring and unimaginative the series has become if you ve had a hard week  it provides a healthy dose of whatever the film quickly abandons biting sarcasm in favor of gumming you to a sloppy  slow death david zucker  who once had one of the most supple comic touches in the business  has turned into the chowderhead who keeps elbowing you in the ribs asking   get it  get it  the first moments  drawn from saw  feature the two least professional and most engaging performers  dr  phil and shaq are chained in the basement and their escape depends on shaq making free throws  which he cannot do  er  to save his life  every scene looks like it was thrown together in two sloppy takes who doesn t like a good charlie sheen   viagra gag  i mean  besides heidi fleiss    the law of diminishing returns is in full effect here    there are a couple of inspired gags but most fall embarrassingly flat the humor is mostly flat and obvious  but anna faris  ability to maintain a straight face as well as her dignity under the most demeaning of circumstances continues to impress there s possibly nothing sadder in the world of cinema than a comedy trying this hard for laughs the cleverness dies slowly in this horror spoof     reaching bottom with a bevy of bathroom jokes and the offal appearance of leslie nielsen as a dithering  bush league president what makes it to the screen feels pretty joyless unspectacular but hardly disastrous comedy you know exactly what you re going to get  and you get it  is that so wrong the jokes miss more than they hit  but there are a lot of them  and when they work  it s gold cheap laughs are better than no laughs at all there s a kinda sorta plot going on here that strings together a bunch of gags  which work more often than not    a cockeyed collection of watered down  lowbrow parodies that have all the revered spark of a joy buzzer jolting an arthritic patient during a spontaneous handshake if you enjoyed any of the previous scary movies this one will likely appeal to you  the humor is broad  but much of it hits the entire film is predicated on turgid slapstick bits that simply congratulate viewers for having seen a handful of recent studio blockbusters for those jonesing for a loosely connected string of comedy sketches  heavy on the scatological humor  this is the fix we ve been assaulted with brokeback parodies for the last five months    who the hell needs another one now much of the humor feels tired and unfunny  and david zucker s directing sags where it should zing it s a far cry from the hilarious  edgy antics of scary movie  but it has about as much going for it as the first sequel a throw it at the wall and see if it sticks onslaught of potty jokes  puns  celebrity cameos  j horror  and j high sophistication and wit  you get laughs  but not nearly as many as you d hoped there are relatively few laughs    unless you crave toilet humor    in this direct to video grade installment there s only so much humor left to wring from the pup tent of brokeback mountain or the matted hair fetish of the japanese horror genre the latest example of cultural degeneration  the stupid scary movie franchise now has one more entry than the smart  satiric scream series it originally set out to spoof for people who like this sort of thing  this is just the sort of thing they like it s not particularly good as a movie but as a collection of jokes it s pretty sublime four installments later  the horror movie jokes have gotten broader  grosser and just plain dumber the three preceding scary movie films were all bad  yet  nevertheless  better than this the perpetual engine of the unkillable scary movie chain is toxic cynicism the early promotional screening forbade internet press even though there was nothing to be afraid of  it is a cleverly integrated spoof  for every sharp one liner or bright sight gag  there are five clunkers  including played out references to russell crowe s phone throwing incident and a lazy jab at michael jackson s fondness for little boys the scary movie franchise is running out of steam pretty fast  they re still funny  and the gags still work  but there s only so far you can go with it for slapsticky  loose limbed  mad magazine style movie satires  you can do no better than the works of director david zucker zucker and his team don t seem to be trying anymore why must hollywood torment so those of us with iqs in the triple digits i really hate to admit this  but the film made me laugh on several occasions for die hard fans for whom there is no such thing as a poop gag taken too far and there can never  ever be too many brokeback mountain parodiesstill an overabundance of potty humor but as far as this franchise goes  i ll take improvements in baby stepsstars anna faris and craig bierko display great comic timing  which is sad considering how little they have to work with     a barrage of low minded gags with high spirited energy like the gags  many of the cameos don t pack a whole lot of punch  but enough succeed so that the viewer leaves with a mildly favorable impression  regrettably  this is probably more a function of human psychology than moviemaking skill    a hodgepodge of tired jokes that is occasionally goosed by a good idea  an inspired cameo  or the comic chops of its main cast  particularly faris  not surprisingly  the fourth installment is a total retread of its predecessor watching the movie is quite a bit like reading a slightly out of date mad magazine or  i guess i should say  quite a bit like i remember mad as a seventh grader the gags are hit and miss  and regardless of their success  they categorically go on too long isn t it amazing to see just how low some people will stoop if you pay them just enough money i just don t see much entertainment value  or  certainly  a shelf life  in a contrived string of mildly amusing parodies of bad movies  here today  yawn tomorrow the humor emphasizes quantity over quality  but the batting average isn t too bad  and where else can you witness leslie nielsen do a nude scene as ever  the jokes are a jumble of the gross  the baggy  the raunchy  the mistimed  and    every once in a while    the refreshingly incorrect three s a trilogy  four s a bore by keeping the parody and humour so tightly focussed  they ve generated more laughter than any other filmmaker this year nannannannanthis was an absolute genius idea to create a rated r animated film  and i hope there are more to come  it is  simply stated  piss your pants funny   both in that i laughed almost hard enough to do that and in that it s the sort of humor where  pissing your pants  would be an actual punchline sausage party is a fun time at the movies  but with its thought provoking plot and its gloriously excessive attitude towards political incorrectness  it s bound to be elevated to cult status alongside the south park film and team america  world police  sausage party is the perfect antidote to what has honestly been one of the weakest summer movie seasons in recent years sausage party has moments of delicious flavor  unfortunately  as a meal it will leave you famished when this picture reaches it s audience  there won t be any stopping it  fans of american animation and lowbrow humor are in for a real treat not only its a hysterically raunchy and jaw dropping comedy  but manages to have food for thought with a risky theme that you don t see in many films when it finds the party  the movie brings down the house with a final half hour bacchanal that s the definition of stoner sublime as a religious satire  sausage party is about as subtle as crucifixion and it goes way too far  but the odd line is a zinger the film surprises you because apart from being hysterically jaw dropping funny  its  ideologies and themes throughout are somehow inexplicably meaningful a hilarious  vulgar  crude  smutty film that will have you snickering at jokes you d like to think that you re above i feel dirty because i saw this and i feel dirty because i want to see it again  sausage party is hilarious  i have never laughed so hard for so long  if you ve seen a trailer for this animated film directed by greg tiernan and conrad vernon  you likely know what you re in for there is some unexpectedly subversive fun to be had at the expense of the world s major religions  but the pace is slow and the point laboured my ribs actually hurt by the end of sausage party  that s the highest praise i can give it sausage party is a rib sprainer if it takes a film about an animated sausage and a bun  laced with toilet humour and extreme sexual puns  to provide a modern day existential critique of the lunacy of human nature and modern racial and religious discourse  then i m all for it candor that has no substance beyond easy stereotypes is just depressing to be fair  there are hints of an interesting perspective shift  and at the heart of it all  a curious darkness     but the writing never really develops much further than the laziest of tropes the surprising thing about sausage party is that its desire to swerve from the norm with dirty humor is evened out by an equally strong impulse to bolster those norms the teenager who lives inside your head will giggle  while the more highly evolved parts of your brain might wonder if it is a trojan horse for parodying xenophobia  extremism  and sexual repression how much fun you have will depend on your tolerance for a diet of non stop swearing and filthy innuendo  the voice cast don t just rain down f bombs  they lob in a good few c grenades for good measure too although is not for everyone  sausage party is an irreverent animated comedy with a surprising depth and social criticism   full review in spanish from sly  not so sly innuendo to unfiltered climaxes  there s not a moment in this movie that isn t packed with jokes  and the thing is  it works  some ingredients are missing  although there s a lively musical number and some clever sight gags and food puns along the way so painfully  irredeemably awful   you ll never look at your neighborhood supermarket the same way again fans of american animation and lowbrow humor are in for a real treat sausage party has a crowded composition that ll look better on the smaller screen  and the background jokes aren t worth much it may be off its trolley but it also feels fresh out of the packet it may be unnecessarily raunchy at times  but there are plenty of strong moments and the heavy handed political commentary is potent if obvious it s funny  non stop inventive and heroically heretical most gags are cooked on the raw side an hilarious anti pixar parody with a filthy mind and a dirty mouth   a near brilliant exercise in bad taste with some very funny moments  and a few crazy setups  this is a good film  it s just not a great film  and ends up being more of a sausage soiree than a sausage party    a novel idea that gets stretched way too thin at the very least  it s better for american film culture that this exists than if it didn t  i did not expect much of this movie  but it turned out better than i expected  it is very funny  with lots of jokes from movies and popular culture     the junk foodie fantasy that stirs american pie  toy story  logan s run  and every torture porn horror of the last decade into a raunchy paean to hedonism with more food puns than a catskills grocer  without the proper comic nutrients  sausage party leaves viewers with a feeling of indigestion an absurd and hallucinatory comedy full of scatological humor and vulgar language  and with a cast composed of notable comedians   full review in spanish an efficient laughing machine and a visually appealing film   full review in spanish a rowdy and original movie  if you re in the right mood  you ll enjoy it   full review in spanish well  surprisingly nuanced for a movie in which nick kroll plays a literal douche  anyway a movie so bizarre  so profane and so quietly virtuous that it works an honest movie full of well sculpted and playful rudeness   full review in spanish who could imagine an all out bloody massacre to be this hilarious an absolutely bizarre film that has a crescendo of naughty humor with one of the most outrageous endings of recent cinema   full review in spanish despite the predictable narrative  it never fails to make you laugh because playing with food is vulgar and messy  but always fun   full review in spanish a very unusual movie that some love for the same reasons that others hate  even though i really enjoyed it  i would have to know very well the other person before recommend this film   full review in spanish less a talking wieners  toon than a post modern snack mix of high concept and lowbrow humour  socio political parables and animation spoofery plus food sex  injected bath salts  and meatloaf s rock  n  roll this is a fairly bangin  bangers mash up i found this adult animated mockery most unpalatable the jokes come thick and fast and hit and miss just as frequently a tasty diversion it may not be suitable for kids  but that s not to say that this strenuously profane cartoon is not unapologetically juvenile in its approach to comedy dirty vegetables sausage party isn t high art  more a snack best washed down with a jumbo cola seth rogen is a genius  lucky  really  that i never liked hot dogs anyway if you like your jokes raw and saucy  sausage part hits the spot i got a lot of pleasure from sausage party  though not as much pleasure as the foodstuffs derive from the frenzied concluding orgy    the film    very quickly passes its sell by date  this is clearly a film set out to shock  offend and  above all else  make you laugh a crude  lewd  food themed riff on toy story that basically functions as an animated parable about organised religion smart ideas and political satire battle it out with relentless smut in a decidedly uneven affair what should have been a shamelessly filthy stoner movie has been watered down with ill judged  undergraduate musings on religion  philosophy and race it sounded like the dumbest movie of all time  but it s actually smart  subversive and packed with famous voices saying wonderfully unspeakable things  in fact  it s a banger re watch value is extremely low with this one as laugh out loud funny as it is jaw droppingly offensive  this is hugely enjoyable comedy that actually has something to say consistently funny  frequently hilarious  just don t order one of those jumbo hotdogs before you take your seat   never mind the guilt  you ll choke laughing sausage party is rude  funny and unexpectedly profound in places  with the juvenile humour leavened by some thoughtful commentary on modern life existential howl of despair meets stoner belly laugh in the latest project from rogen and collaborators  who follow  this is the end  with another high concept comedy that  like a horror movie  reduces its characters to meat this animated comedy is decidedly not for kids  it s rambunctiously filthy in more ways than one  and while it s not exactly hilarious  it s at least consistently amusing and has a positive attitude  shamelessly pun filled  sexually explicit  socio political animation   for an adult audience reviewers who cynically boast that sausage party  isn t kids  stuff  have it wrong    p roducer seth rogen    continues his self amusement with self congratulatory political satire the final half hour or so is an exhilarating action sequence beautifully done  ending in a rather excellent sausage party indeed one of the most effective parables about religion ever filmed groceries aren t an obvious fit for the bawdy comedy of rogen and his superbad  pineapple express screenwriting partner in crime evan goldberg  that s a large part of sausage party s appeal sausage party won t fill you up with laughs  but there are some amusing dishes being served  thought up by rogen and friends likely while getting baked good it s definitely a tender and insightful comedy  but it s also as crude as they come rogan and company frequently mistake an overabundance of four letter words for genuine humor sausage party glints of greatness  but this is half cocked comedy at best sausage party will likely be remembered more for what it says than how it says it  but that s not the worst thing you can say about a movie sausage party is a delicious treat covered in a filthy wrapper  for some  that will be a deal breaker  but for plenty of others  it will be a selling point it s content to remain in sub lowbrow land for the duration  except when it feels like imparting a lofty message it never earns forget famous atheists stephen hawking  richard dawkins and bill maher  sausage party is the movement s mein kampf      the most fun i ve had with food since i was a child recreating the extinction of the dinosaurs with dino shaped nuggets  my mouth  and a giant pool of ketchup  sausage party  is a filthy feast   and that s a good thing  its half baked political ideas take away from the wholly satisfying and surreal pixar riff it could have been one of the more clever conceits is how it plays with the central conundrum of pixar  how do you connect all these animals or toys or robots beings that  to humans  have no emotions or thoughts or even faces to the human world that they walk around in puerile and self indulgent without a real laugh to be found  i have no idea how this gets released by a major studio  while ralph bakshi has to go to kickstarter for a vimeo release  just say no  like the sex  drugs  and politics that are fodder for the script  the question of what happens when we leave this world is addressed directly  and with the same fulsome sense of mischief  sausage party is definitely not for everyone  but it offers an amusing blend of humor and substance  providing viewers with heady food for thought some of the gags are more cringy than others    like craig robinson s cracka hating box of grits    but don t call it empty calories explore s  ideology the way emril lagasse seasons soup rogen and his frequent collaborator evan goldberg dreamed up the story with actor jonah hill  and though it might sound like a critique of religion  they opt instead for a lowbrow  sporadically funny celebration of hedonism sausage party is like a pixar movie that s gotten hopped up on crystal meth and viagra sausage party is a gleeful ode to anarchy that transcends both stoner comedy and pixar spoof you re getting what s advertised on the menu  for the better  and never the worse sausage party is a full on assault on civility and social mores  yes  that s the point  and yes  it s quite funny on occasion  maybe it s just too much an audacious idea in need of a more adventurous script  taking this madness to the next level of brain bleeding humor and commentary  securing itself as both an inspired farce and a samurai sharp inspection of sheeple culture this smack in the face of good manners is surprising and strange  often delightfully so despite a few pokes at the folks from pixar  nobody will lose any sleep over it  obviously  these r rated cinematic tricks from rogen  et al  are not for kids you can see the obvious social political jokes being made  but it s so juvenile it is  without a doubt  the most delirious movie to come out of a major studio in decades  perhaps ever i know sausage party is not made for kids  but they don t have to try so hard to prove it sausage party  is smarter than it looks at the same time as it is overly taken with its juvenile humor you might find yourself alone one night imagining your dinner screaming with every bite you take  and then wonder  is that half eaten slice of pizza plotting cheesy vengeance upon me    or am i the half eaten slice of pizza so many different shades of wrong all wrapped up in one movie that  even as i sit to write this  i m unsure whether i was howling with laughter or begging for it to stop a bold  visually exuberant fusion of provocative adult content with an art form too often chalked up as being strictly for kids   sausage party  is something special consistently sophomoric  periodically hilarious  and peppered with minor stoner insights there is no one out there making comedies quite like rogen and goldberg  they are putting their definitive stamp on the modern american comedy one decency smashing double entendre at a time it s the kind of foodie filth one dreams up while chomping on doritos and twinkies during a psychedelic haze what is there to say about sausage party  a surprising amount this is a film that tackles some big themes  religion  sex  ethnic conflict  the meaning of life and death  it s also a crude burlesque about talking food items who swear a lot more than they really need to sausage party is so wrong  so go for broke insane  existing words aren t enough to describe it  shockrageous comes close  as does horristurbing it s wild and funny  also disturbing  also borderline insane  this is a film that starts out funny and ratchets up the insanity not only does the film effortlessly mock the sense of wonder and the emotional roller coasters we ve all felt watching pixar s big eyed sentient objects  but  in its own messed up way  it provokes some new feelings  too  shock and awe    an effed up funhouse  rogen  a livewire satirist  dishes out an r rated cartoon treat that tackles the crisis in the middle east  the nonexistence of god and the sex lives of supermarket products at a moment when news from our actual world so often seems a nightmare parody of itself     there is sweet balm in seeing a bagel and a lavash overcome their differences to find mutual pleasure in one another almost never pushes the boundaries far enough  seemingly patting itself on the back for peppering the f word into a cartoon with such frequency cranks the absurdity of the narrative and the anxieties in frightening  analogous real world neuroses we cling to long past sell by dates  sounds like a harshed mellow  but the whole thing is stoned immaculate  your body will hurt from laughing sausage party has plenty of funny moments  especially for fans of lowbrow humor those who enjoy the rogen goldberg humor will undoubtedly be laughing for much of it  and even those with more sophisticated senses of humor will find a few things to chuckle about  sausage party  is an unrelenting whirlwind of lowbrow and objectionable jokes and situations that will make it difficult for you to catch your breath even with all the four letter words  this still feels like immature kids  stuff sausage party may be the most un pc mainstream movie to hit cinemas in yonks and it may outrage  shock and even repulse you at times  but it is undeniably ridiculously funny this ended up being one meal that left me hungering for something more substantive  constantly hoping for a second course that sadly hadn t been prepared for me to taste unquestionably dumb and distasteful  but stakes its claim as the funniest film of the season uncompromising with its philosophy and its vulgarityi like that it s willing to engage in a controversial statement even if it doesn t have all the ammunition it needs to back up its stance we know that everyone involved in this movie has made superior material  so it s a shame to see rogen and company slumming in their own filth for sheer audacity  sausage party is impressive just when you think this surreal world can t surprise you any longer  it comes up with something else that may make you gasp or wince but will most likely make you laugh  a movie that s clearly not for everyone  but those at whom it s targeted whether allowed to enter according to the r rating or not will find it a hoot it looks like pixar  but plays like monty python sausage party takes racism and prejudice and throws them into its existential meat grinder to explore identity  tolerance and religion in surprisingly intelligent fashion despite all the cursing and envelope pushing and bat bleep crazy sexual stuff  sausage party isn t mean spirited  it s just    stupid  but also pretty smart  and funny as hell sausage party is a nasty  crass  and unique movie that only rogen and goldberg could concoct relentlessly filthy and often jaw droppingly funny  this creation bearing the prolific imprint of seth rogen and evan goldberg is one of the most transgressive animated films to emerge from hollywood in recent memory directors greg tiernan and conrad vernon are working with a first rate cast  running wild with stereotypes and daring you to be offended in a dominant era for family friendly animation  sausage party is a bold rebuttal needing more than shock laughs by the time it reaches its  heh  climax with a storewide food fuck fest  any attempt at a serious critique of its interpretation of the israeli palestinian conflict feels a little ridiculous sausage party isn t as profound as it pretends to want to be  but it s brilliant at being stupid  a gleefully vulgar and very funny spoof of the pixar formula as ridiculous as  sausage party  sounds  it actually manages to humanize the items we so violently slice  dice and devour  you may never look at a potato or bag of baby carrots the same way again literally bananas  and also nuts a really funny  crass and often thoughtful comedy that doesn t overstay its welcome created as the movie your perverted older brother made in high school but you can t help but love him for it  the definitely offensive but enthusiastically rapturous romp is the surprise hit of the summer your mileage may vary  as they say  also  hugs not drugs if watching cartoon characters spout four letter words is your thing  this might well be the greatest movie ever made  rogen and goldberg start with spoofery and work their way into something bolder and stranger  it s as if playing in the pixar sandbox  or a reasonable approximation thereof  can t help but inspire creativity you will come for the kind of humor promised in the title and the well earned r rating  but stay for the nuanced meditations on theology and faith demented  and deep  the atheist equivalent of a veggietales movie imagine that the pixar writers room dosed themselves with psychedelic drugs and went to their local supermarket to quench their munchies  the result is the perverse hilarity of sausage party its observation that life is full of cruelty and there is probably no afterlife and we waste most of our lives consuming images of a reality we cannot fully apprehend is pretty much true  but neither novel nor amusing the script by seth rogen  evan goldberg  kyle hunter and ariel shaffir has an inspired stupid idea  and boundless nerve  as well as a legitimate interest in theological debate  truly  it does sausage party is an equal opportunity offender  but if you can stomach that you ll find a movie with a lot of heart and big ideas to ponder maybe if the movie employed a bit more subtlety on all fronts  it d be a far more successful outing  but subtlety seems like it was one of sausage party s chief adversaries from the ground shelf up though sausage party is above all else a carnally inclined cartoon  there is more to the movie than just being pixar with a potty mouth mix  a people s history of the united states  with  caligula   a stoner comedy and a slasher flick   then animate the results   and you ve got the essence of the thing ballsy and dumb and brilliant all in one bite  you can gobble it up like empty calories  or over chew each joke this  secret life of groceries   like so many other seth rogen movies  is a congenial mess of the outrageously funny and the bong induced lazy drags  the film isn t willing to completely face the bleakness of its allegory faith versus skepticism  sausage party  for better or worse  is a movie that actually exists  and  at some point along the way  that fact will actually shock you the entire ensemble saves the best for last  joining in a finale that one might describe as orgasmic  like the rest of  sausage party   it s absolutely filthy  which would be objectionable if it also weren t so funny    consistently funny  occasionally clever and undoubtedly unmissable if you re a baked potato  even if you re offended   and perhaps rightfully so   there s another joke coming around the corner to change the subject  and some terrifically wild characters to keep you laughing the whole thing is so tasty  you may just want seconds an animated adventure that boasts the visual prowess of the best mainstream releases in the medium  yet the storytelling sensibility of a stoner nodding furiously mid toke at the zeitgeist documentary playing on the tv won t be for everyone  but if nothing else  you ll never look at your groceries the same way again as sausage party breaks out of its pixar inspired packaging  so to speak  its repetitiveness evolves into a delirious cacophony of obscenities sausage party is obviously the product of diseased minds  and i love it consistently hilarious  even borderline genius  and the most fun you ll have in a cinema this year  d oesn t amount to more than its central conceit and the incessant cultural gags and profanities it uses as tiresome embellishments i m not really sure there s any age where you re ready to see sausage party s epic  virtuoso climax  a graphic bacchanal conducted entirely by the contents of your fridge  let s call it an acquired taste sausage party is what would happen if everyone at pixar had syphilis some of it is  admittedly  funny and or transgressive  some of it is one joke stretched thin  but when it works  it really works try to imagine the most disgusting  foul mouthed  and disturbing pixar film ever put to celluloid  and you ll probably land somewhere near sausage party  but not too close  it s unlike anything else the laughs barely let up after that first scene  in fact  in a film that proves to be not just more than a boundary stretching exercise but one of the funniest arguments for the non existence of god in some time there is nothing redeemable about sausage party  other than how hard it made me laugh  sausage party is quintessential rogen  offering no more and no less than we have come to expect every minute of sausage party is brimming with wildly inappropriate jokes and situations  no spoilers here of course  but brace yourself for something unprecedented that will undoubtedly have your jaw hit the floor a raunchy and witty animated comedy that definitely isn t kids  stuff fans of bongo playing narcissist matthew mcconaughey will breeze through this formulaic rom com  though it possesses about as much charm as it does logic it s not funny  it is occasionally witty  but not very often  it seems the filmmakers realized that as well as they fill the frequent dry spells with physical comedy that doesn t really fit the tone of the movie a limp romantic comedy  this cut and paste bookend to last year s  hitch  finds sarah jessica parker playing paula a demoralized romantic turned  professional interventionist verging on the preposterous  director tom dey s failure to launch relies on attractive stars to overcome its lackluster execution failure to launch  the same can be said for the movie zooey deschanel steals so many scenes as paula s anti social roommate that she deserves to share top billing alongside mcconaughey and parker it s everything wrong with bad romantic comedies  all rolled into one easy to hate package the movie s notion of humor is exemplified by bradshaw s extended nude scene a romantic comedy in the true sense of the word   failure to launch  is the first certified  date film  of the year as listless and phony as failure to launch may be  it does have one secret weapon in zooey deschanel the multiple contrivances and the inevitable grinding of the storytelling gears will have you itching to go home    whether you happen to live with your parents or not i just hated every single character soooo muchadd to this a confused moral message and it s clear that  as its title inadvertently suggests  this romantic comedy never gets off the ground it d take a considerably more charming pair of leads to salvage a concept this lame and a screenplay this witless one of those average romantic comedies that hollywood churns out several times a year like widgets on an assembly line the two times i did laugh  no one else did tom dey directs with all the energy of a cook flipping burgers at jack in the box as bland as corn flakes    logic be damned if this film needs an artificial catharsis to keep audiences from falling asleep this rom com dodges the unsavory omen of its title and once again demonstrates that predictable plots aren t so bad if they involve matthew mcconaughey removing his shirt what fails to launch is anything remotely convincing or appealing flimsy but fun  this rom com has an enjoyable edge to it    just don t expect to remember much about it in the morning it s more of a  smile  film a failure on so many levels   failure to launch  is among the first of the lame  badly written romantic comedies that we re doomed to see this year  and every year  for that matter there s nothing here a good dose of viagra couldn t cure  impotent and dull as dishwater as a romantic comedy this is very aptly titled  but it earns an extra star for zooey deschanel s bonkers performance  they should have made the film all about her     a classic example of a movie that isn t as good as the sum of its parts  but those individual parts are surprisingly entertainingfailure to launch shoots itself in the foot by refusing to take its premise seriously  the very thing that seems most interesting is the same thing that the film goes out of its way to avoid dealing with when s the last time the tightly clenched buttcheeks of a former pro football star tickled your funnybone everyone here is sour and detestable on some level  and though the film generates some chuckles and some interest due to its sheer quirkiness  we stare on in a freak show kind of way it sounds like a vehicle with plenty of comedy mileage  but failure to launch quickly runs out of steam how  exactly  did an idea with this much star power and comic potential manage to misfire there s no spark in the romance because people in romantic comedies are simply not allowed to be people anymore  they re hair and outfits inside a premise i thought i was watching the challenger disaster instead of a romantic comedy rather than address how personal idiosyncracies struggle in relationships  failure to launch exists in an appalling fantasy world of quota compliance the writers     have ideas that could be funny  but they don t follow through on any of them a film so egregiously bad that it really should be chopped into small pieces and buried under a freeway overpass it s completely unbelievable failure to launch isn t even a one trick pony  it s a no trick pony  mcconaughey and parker try  but they can t save a premise as insipid as this one not one of mcconaughey s best filmsfailure to launch in a nutshell  constantly inching past your wildly low expectations  some sharp dialogue raises this romantic comedy above the tv sitcom genre three months into the year and finally a decent romantic comedy hits theaters a very aptly named movie even scrumtious manlyberry ala mode mcconaughey cant save this fiasco  failure to launch fails to entertain   in the least once in a while  it s just nice to have romance and comedy come together in a pleasant surprise when the stars aren t charming the viewer  the film is busy shooting itself in the foot the film s hit to miss joke ratio isn t as favorable as you might wish as date movies goe  this misanthropic misfire is briefly amusing but instantly forgettable     the film lurches more often than it launches matthew sexiest man alive mcconaughey ought to be in westerns  but not many are being made  so he plays a walking  winky pin up in failure to launch  which may launch commercially but is a failure this is a showcase for her  parker s  sensitive intelligence  her watchfulness  and her way of thinking and reacting  the family stone did nothing for parker  but failure to launch makes a strong case for life after sex and the city failure to launch is yet another disposable romantic comedy made with little thought or skill failure to launch  a funny but overly busy romantic comedy there are zero sparks between  the leads       it seems the only reason these two are together is because they re both on the movie poster it s the lamest idea for a romantic comedy in recent memory  as well as one of the sorriest star vehicles in ages what failure to launch doesn t have is the crucial link between mcconaughey and parker suggesting they are indeed meant to be together and worth rooting for  more evidence that chemistry is the one special effect that hollywood still can t manage this is a guy comedy being mismarketed as a chick flick  complete with a poster that looks like a page from lucky magazine the plot synopsis sounds less like sitcom than sick com  a womanizer has the tables turned on him when he falls in love with  essentially  a prostitute whose services are being paid for by parents who don t have the decency to ask him to leave director tom dey throws in so much energetic slapstick that the film feels lively and fresher than it probably should  especially during several scenes involving animal induced mayhem like tripp  failure to launch has a good heart but would be better off moving out of familiar territory failure to launch stumbles its way to a happy ending without generating either much romance or comedy as you d predict  tripp and paula fall in love  it s not very interesting  then he finds out she s a hired hand  he freaks  they split  they get back together  and blah  blah  blah the comical part    the part with the assaulting fauna    is eccentric  knockabout fun  spattered with outlandish setups and amicably offbeat supporting players who reach out and steal the show you re tempting fate when you name your movie failure to launch  especially when your movie s as stubbornly earthbound as this one  matthew mcconaughey and sarah jessica parker are two likable actors with the absolute worst taste in roles  at least putting them together means only one bad movie will ensue rather than two  individually if you re in search of a film with any real emotion or believable story  forget it  if you re ok with a flick that has some funny bits and a kooky couple playing second banana    hey  launch on parker does occasionally make us forget that failure to launch is so bereft of comic ideas that it ultimately stoops to giving terry bradshaw a nude scene to milk a laugh the only thing i rooted for in failure to launch was for matthew mcconaughey and sarah jessica parker    the two leads    to find better movies under tom dey s direction  a perverse form of symmetry is at work here  and the stereotypes seem like old acquaintances you can enjoy for a couple of hours the two tv writers have taken a premise ripe with potential for laughter and social commentary and turned into a hackneyed sitcom cursed with an honest title  failure to launch waves a white flag in scene after scene  declaring surrender there are elements of failure to launch that elevate it  albeit sporadically  above the typical romantic comedy that it is failure to launch s  unlikable lowlife leads are perfect for each other  considering that if they never met on earth  they might someday cross paths in hell there s no question that it sounds good in concept  but in execution it amounts to little more than putting lipstick on a very old pig the movie is surprisingly nimble and emotionally honest the film goes a layer deeper than most formulaic chick flicks  it dabbles in the sociological aspects of why many present day adults refuse to leave the nest  as well as the effect on aging parents the movie is silly and cute  but spoiled by its own failure to be special a decent start can t save another run of the mill romantic comedy snoozer failure to launch thankfully doesn t live up to its title  bolstered by some quirky performances  it actually takes off in a surprisingly engaging way if you looked up the word  fluff  in the dictionary  you shouldn t be surprised if it shows a poster for this romantic comedy   the best scenes of the movie are unrelated to the overall plot and involve the supporting cast    if only the movie was about them instead whatever the opposite of chemistry may be  mcconaughey and parker have plenty of it    one of the few romantic comedies in history in which the couple s fights are far more credible than their flirting paula s practiced fraud sounds criminal at worst and grounds for civil suits at best  but to hollywood  it s a romantic comedy    downright repellent     possibly the perfect chick flick buddy flick hybrid    light enough  clever enough  and well rounded enough to earn and entertain its target audience  a s nasty and misanthropic a piece of work as  oh  the entire genre of nasty and misanthropic  romantic   comedies  we ve been bombarded with in recent years    half of which seem to star matthew mcconaughey   if anything  the whole thing reeks of nothing more than a second rate pilot for a bad sitcom some movies are on auto pilot from the get go  failure to launch doesn t even have a pilot this is a bloated snl sketch comedy film  complete with terry bradshaw nudity and a cast pausing for the audience to laugh failure to launch tries very hard to break out of the romantic comedy formula with some additional wackiness and guy humor  but they might have been better sticking to the formula it s two things and both of them suck failure to launch is a not so distant cousin of those happy go lucky herpes commercials that play on television  it s so far out it scans as science fiction this would be romantic comedy is neither  the premise is misbegotten  the chemistry non existent and the dialogue leaden the stars are pleasant but unexciting  the goofy ensemble has a few moments of hilarity but never catches fire  the laughs are very scattered and the film s title is a self fulfilling prophecy the movie casts around wildly for comic set pieces  coming up with things like aggressive chipmunks  hostile dolphins and a dad who longs to be naked at all times every character has been given enough quirk to make the movie sublimely enjoyable but not so much that it becomes precious you know that you re in trouble when audiences leave the theater talking about the supporting cast with nary a mention of the movie starstripp is such a stud that he has to beat women off with a stick  or  rather  with his parents    this isn t just idiotic  it s indefensible  it s also the picture s premise it is a sweet and funny sitcom  but without an iota of originality oh  what stupid people these are the title of the movie could also serve as its review it s fun stuff  overall  inconsequential and fluffy and not too cheesy until the end this is a bright and bouncy date movie with some sharp lines and even sharper performances  especially from bates and bradshaw as with most romantic comedies  failure to launch takes off thanks to its upbeat tone and the charisma of its stars there are so many diversions in failure to launch  it s as if the movie is bored by its own story it s good  not brilliant  not a future oscar contender  but a perfectly sturdy  sweet  pleasingly non formulaic production that should amuse a variety of age groups failure to launch isn t about story  it s about star power  adjust your expectations accordingly the stars execute their silly romantic comedy dance steps as if to the manner born  but it is the funny shuffle and halt tango between bartha s computer nerd and deschanel s man proof misanthrope that add some real zest even by the low standards of high concept hollywood rom coms  this charmless  prophetically titled stinker stands apart  suggesting that the recent mass firings at studio paramount may not have been such a bad idea after all the movie is so intent on displaying mcconaughey s wares that it gives him a shirtless surfing scene    and the picture is set in baltimore so limp and mirthless that it would barely pass muster as a single season network sitcom a bizarre  mixed up mess  but one with good moments courtesy of a solid supporting cast silly  lighthearted  funny   and despite a slow start  ultimately charms its target audience it fails at romance and comedy  it fails to make the lead characters interesting and their love affair believable  and it fails to develop a consistent tone that would enable viewers to suspend their disbelief lively and enjoyable but nothing remotely special    this could be just about any romantic comedy ever made  complete with a contrived premise and a bright cast to distract us from the same old formula relentlessly predictable and painfully unfunny   a total failure failure to launch arrives pre told by design  but even those coming in cold will know what s going to happen one step ahead a cloying mess crying for another rewrite  or maybe just the quick mercy of being plunked into the nearest trash can launch writes itself into such a corner that the only way it can manage a happy ending is to lock its leads in a room and force them to have a meaningful conversation a good alternate to the death penalty  watching this movie over and over and over  that  my friends  is what is called a fate worse than death the title is perfectly apt    and too easy a target    for this romantic comedy that never shifts out of second gear beneath the sitcom sheen  there s a darker movie about broken people who use convenient  pitiful excuses to keep from growing up  you laugh at them  but you also have sympathy sometimes a movie works because all of the ingredients come together so well  failure to launch is one of those movies  failure to launch is an especially slight romantic comedy whose modest charms are derived largely from its supporting players stars matthew mcconaughey and sarah jessica parker put as much energy  winning smiles and comic business into their roles as possible  but it s a no go from the start nannannannannanthe plot unravels rather than cranking up  the mcguffin with spooner can be seen coming from a long way off  while the film jinks rather than twists towards its inevitable climax a dreary action mystery that spends far too much time mucking around a villainous plot that isn t nearly as difficult to unravel as the protagonist makes it will smith almost redeems generic man vs  machine actioner pretty to look at but there s not much under the hood in this isaac asimov based futuristic murder mystery   a lot of fun with excellent direction   it feels like an anonymous hollywood studio film that overwhelmed the director with the demands to fashion a blockbuster vehicle for its star the movie is at least a bit less annoying than director alex proyas  previous two genre attempts smith s occasional sullenness suggests he is itching for another ali like chance to prove his acting chops even as he slums his way through another high tech shoot  em up sonny  voiced by alan tudyk  is the equal of the other two leads both in his screen presence and the empathy he draws from the audience if you are looking for proof that hollywood has completely run out of ideas  check out i  robot as i  robot details how smith must fight for his survival against an army of white men whom he alone knows are evil  the film might have been called  i  hollywood  a thriller typically is only as good as its villain  and too many of them are bloodless here  except for the hot blooded performance of smith    the movie is cool  right down to its color scheme for those who like their sci fi to have the depth and breadth of comic books    passable as a vibrating escapist flick in spite of proya s sporadically flat direction and the uneven interpretation of asimov s wry commentary an enjoyable action flick a dull  derivative  film  with no new ideas and a main character who  while clearly simple minded  is somehow the smartest guy in the story  nobody is going to mistake this future noir for spielberg s minority report  but for a light headed adrenaline rush  it works pretty well the extras begin with an intelligent  interesting and thorough audio commentary by director alex proyas and writer akiva goldsman a film so detached from asimov s vision  it emerges as a destabilized attempt at reworking an already polished concept based on isaac asimov s short story collection and directed by alex proyas  who did much better with  dark city  and  the crow  this is jaw droppingly juvenile and insulting to my intelligence  perhaps its subject matter is obsolete  asimov deserved better an uninspired  recycled action thriller whether there s anything substantial under the sheen and cgi of alex proyas  glistening future vision is debatable  but this enjoyable  engrossing picture is at least intelligently artificial it may or may not come as a surprise  but will smith is out acted by the robots better than anyone had any right to expect    the key to what makes  i  robot  work is a well thought out script   a multi villain axis of evil and a pulpy vision that feels machine hacked this summer picture has a brain as well as muscles proyas succumbs to the inane post matrix tendency to pump up action sequences with sudden moments of slow motion gymnastics that are almost laughablea b movie blast about power and greedit s all mechanically done  but at least i robot manages to be entertaining  rises above plot holes and stilted dialogue just enough to be a fun sunday afternoon matineea by the numbers action film retrofitted as a sci fi work of art    better than i ever expected it to be on most levels  props itself up with allusions to deep thoughts but in reality is just a long action movie gussied up in special effects far from perfect  but it s entertaining  well executed and definately worth a look i  robot succeeds where other movies that blend science fiction and mystery fiction have failed a fun   surprisingly smart ride that is also true to the spirit of asimov s more thoughtful and low key work    every once in awhile  this summer popcorn sci fi movie provides a glimmer of asimov   i  robot is a disappointment not because of what it is  but because of what it could have been mixing animation and live action nearly seamlessly  i  robot turns isaac asimov s robot world into the backdrop for a prosaic summer action film i  robot is the meanest  meatiest  coolest  most engaging and exciting science fiction movie in a long time for all its flaws  i  robot is arresting to look at i  robot is the summer s best action movie so far  it proves that you don t necessarily need to detach your brain in order to walk into a big budget summer blockbuster i  robot fails to do much of anything other than take our money and repay us with some moments of cgi induced spectacle and a handful of rehashed ideas it s good to know that  in the future  we can still thaw out a cryogenically preserved will smith to save the world every july delivers the goods as a zippy piece of sci fi pulp i  robot is that rare entry among summer blockbusters    a film with something on its mind  a thinking person s action picture     it is definitely one of this summer s better blockbusters when  i  robot  digs in to deliver the goods  it does so with first rate action and special effects sequences that are thrilling i  robot is an enthralling bit of genre fiction  overcoming an uncertainty of focus with a handful of terrific scenes even with its flaws  i  robot still computes to being a warm weather winner by adeptly combining action and ideas  it proves that hollywood can still produce astonishing entertainment strives to be so many things that it ultimately falls away to nothing  a heap of expensive metal parts while not a classic by any means  is still a mostly entertaining experience i  robot may not break much new ground  but it s engaging enough in what it does to keep the viewer interested it s a good  workmanlike popcorn movie  but nothing morethe plot isn t very smart or exciting  but the action  including the scene in which the house is demolished  is spectacular maybe we should start having robots write movie scripts it s fun  sure  but uninspired  we ve seen it all before    will smith does his old will smith thing again  with only the minimum level of actual entertainment to dress it up pretty to look at but as cold and removed as its title character      a slick  consistently entertaining thrill ride    you hope for another  independence day  but what you get is another  wild  wild west  a robot must protect itself as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  the law of thermodynamics  the law of the jungle  or law and order  svu best of all  this is a story that s actually about something good character development and the great on screen chemistry between smith and bridget moynahan also give this movie a big boost despite an admirable effort on the part of its creative team  this new technological thriller is at odds with itself from the very first moments the message is old hat by now  but i  robot is a genuine will smith movie  what more do you need it s a flimsily sketched psychological sci fi movie that never feels more than being robotic  e nough breathtaking visuals to make you forgive the movie its plot holes and its tendency to lapse into product placement parody  for the most part  this is thrilling fun succeed on its own terms as an entertaining mid season popcorn movie a failure of imagination performances  plot and pacing are as mechanical as the hard wired cast an unexpectedly engaging futuristic mystery despite its familiar  derivative  yet ironic  story  it s a sleek  stylish  sinister fun flick with a speculative metaphysical ending that makes you think a cgi laced action movie cum merchandising opportunity  warped into insensate silliness by the pop iconic demands of smith s megabucks macho action hero persona and peppered with stock cop on the  edge action movie situations substandard will smith action hero vehicle    what we basically have here is a summer movie disguised as a sci fi epic  on that level  it works  the screenplay is  good enough to keep things moving  to supply smith with one  liners and to provide an excuse for the compelling backdrop the film goes where you expect  with the rather programmed feel of a  classic  revisited with both money and zeal this movie is blatant when it should have been subtle  and this is never more evident than in the unpleasant performance of its star  will smith smart and remarkably well plotted while i  robot is consistently entertaining and considerably smarter than your average summer action flick  it s never particularly exciting or emotionally compelling a middling entertainment taken simply as a will smith summer blockbuster  i  robot scores above average i  robot is everything a summer blockbuster should bemuch of the movie feels dull or derivative surprisingly smart  cool looking  nicely paced and well acted i  robot is fun  even when it relies a bit too much on standard police procedure cliches will smith is darker  sexier in his latest summer blockbuster    but despite an entertaining execution of isaac asimov s robotic visions  it leaves you cold it s an intriguing mix  if not always a smooth one  yet  to its credit  i  robot never gives up on  its  ideas  not even at the height of all the sound and fury purely mechanical scenario owes much to robot think  but little to asimov s scientifically informed humanism pretty good science fiction may be slick  but it s as cold and dehumanized as a robot  asimov  probably would have been  appalled by  this cartoonish creation plays like a compendium of summer blockbusters a movie of its kind and of its time    functional  professional  slickly manufactured and slouching toward consciousness    i  robot is a perfect slave to mechanical convention as far as popcorn summer flicks go  this one s error free will smith fans will likely be disappointed  and lovers of fine cinema best look elsewhere  but if you re looking for robots going crazy  this one s worth your money director alex proyas lays on the tomorrowland awe of shiny metallics  techno worship and fascist efficiency that make the future look like a nice place to visit in the end  what will be remembered is how disappointing a treatment this is of some pretty revered source material a watchable enough piece of summer entertainment an engaging cgi fueled ride  a  self important  derivative and muddled sci fi thriller the plot is simple minded and disappointing  and the chase and action scenes are pretty much routine for movies in the sci fi cgi genre the sort of multiplex buster that depends more on editing and production design than on story line when smith and monaghan are interacting with sonny the robot  you swear he s a real person who just happens to look a bit odd    a will smith cop picture with the slight novelty of having robots as perps robots  explosions  gunplay  action  will smith   hmmm  it must be july the three laws of robotics still seem as fresh  compelling and provocative as ever  it s an action thriller that races at breakneck speed and dazzles the audience  even if this program still has a few bugs to iron out    thrilling  it s intriguing and most of all  a lot of fun  it frankly takes a welcome  byte  out of every other blockbuster on show at the momentperhaps some day the original asimov stories will make it to the screen     t his i  robot is one of the best science fiction films we re likely to see this year  bad  bots  bad  bots  what ya gonna do there s no swifter way to ruin  not bad  than a reminder of something truly great    and for i  robot  that reminder is never further away than the title this asimov inspired adaptation is the rare summer blockbuster that supplies an actual science fiction story   albeit cleverly packaged to look like a  will smith movie  an overbudgeted  underscripted  lazy piece of workso the unlikely allies  a robot hater  a robot lover and a robot  all team up to solve the case  it s kinda cute a good story with one of two parts that malfunction   the wise guy comedy is going to make the movie more commercial  but in this case  it hurts the story a real missed opportunity   a potentially groundbreaking film reduced to a mess fit only for the slack jawed mallrats that it is being aimed   big budget  big effects tale of men and machines has a tiny imagination and a robo crafted soul it s a will smith movie    with robots  it s a brilliant concept  really filmmaker alex proyas finally finds the perfect balance between the real world and the one of his imagination  breathing humanity into a genre gleaming with artifice a freshly microwaved mix of blade runner and minority report topped with a big dollop of cheese i  robot is a movie destined for fast forward buttons the world over the effects work here doesn t break any incredible new ground or shatter any records  and yet this is one of the most visually impressive movies i have ever seen more like dorothy wandering lost through the great land of oz  only without the heart of a i   the brains of minority report or the courage of blade runner engagingly silly film ring a ding dull it may not be asimov but its plot is truly labyrinthine  it works a specific theme and it s happy to end itself in a shroud of enigma easily this summer s most welcome big budget surprise  a studio film that isn t afraid to ask its audience to think del s repeatedly attacked by bad robots  marked by glowing red lights in their chests and behaviors not a little derivative of the first terminator at his film s end a hunk of expensive  lifeless junk i  robot is the best kind of adventure movie  one that engages your heart  your sense of humor and your ache for a good yarn a movie that never stops feeling like an advertisement for itself i  robot is less compelling as a drama of the human enslavement of androids than it is an intriguing vision of a treeless  cashless future awesome fx  poor story  suggested by  isaac asimov s book of short stories  alex proyas s hectic thriller engages some interesting ideas on its way to an overblown and incoherent ending the film works best as a kind of mindless  action packed b movie  but on the a level at which recent science fiction fantasy films operate  this movie falls woefully short i  robot is yet another summer entree in which good intentions are stymied by excessive bric a brac while it s hardly a philosophical film  the screenplay by jeff vintar and akiva goldsman does have an idea or two those who are unfamiliar with asimov s work may enjoy i  robot as a summer popcorn movie  it s just unfortunate that it s not more discerning horror fans will enjoy this futuristic science fiction actioner for its dark  sinister elements at least it s a beautiful crappy movie  and nearly worth seeing for the special effects and set design alone brickbat socialism in a dimwit populist entertainment      the film is about as subtle as a dump truck  isaac asimov s colorful fantasies for teenage boys a half century and more ago are intact i  robot is a slice of sci fi heaven with a hearty side of bewitching visual euphoria a whodunit that keeps you guessing right to the end while it s not in a league with blade runner  the terminator or even robocop  i  robot is an efficiently designed  well oiled machine a high tech thriller that really works    both because of its eye popping visual feats and the ideas and humanity behind them worlds better than a mess like men in black ii i  robot is not as nerdy as it sounds     it s one of the most interesting films of the summeronly if you ve never seen one before  it s the best sci fi movie ever made  it s entertaining  but essentially a shiny new retread of older models the movie has a handful of things that will make it worth watching on cable  someday it has a slow buildup  but its final third manages to generate some eye popping thrills without the usual obligatory dismissal of all narrative in the face of explosions a routine will smith cop on  the hunt thriller at heart  i  robot lacks imaginative excitement a visually impressive effort that mixes the pizzazz of an action oriented popcorn movie with a more humane sensibility than is usually the case a cool summer movie packing a nice mix of action  explosions  and brains i guess a summer special effects blockbuster with plot development is too much to ask for  maybe i should have my own wiring examined aesthetically dazzling  nothing but one big chase scene   it plays as if robots even wrote the script    and stupid robots at that one can t help but admire a know how that permits a generation of walking nuts and bolts to move effortlessly amongst men  lots of exciting action sequences  a charismatic hero  a few chuckles here and there and some top drawer special effects work  the only thing it lacks is isaac asimov at first smith feels miscast  but he warms into the role  good pace  nice robot effects  entertaining some of the most convincing and lifelike visual effects in movie history  this is a wide scope sci fi thriller done right androids may dream of electric sheep  but i  robot s multi million dollar machines are remnants of summer films gone by nannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannannanif you re looking for something that s a bit scruffy and off the beaten track  but still full of giant explosions  you ll definitely want to check out green hornet there are enough genuinely funny  self aware gags and throwaway lines to keep you entertained the whole film feels fairly self indulgent on seth rogen s part  it s rather dull and quite a letdown aside from the james franco cameo  this story is one disappointment after another  this movie would a helluva lot better with paper mache sets i like seth  you like seth  we all like seth  badly miscast  here  and so was the director  a pleasingly average superhero movie whose greatest triumph is avoiding disaster this had potential to be something of an action thrill ride  or at least a comedic  campy take on the usual superhero formula  but what we end up with is a directionless  pointless backdrop for blowing things up with some martial arts thrown in for kicks a dud  that has a few bright spots there are some good ideas here but they re buried under masses of conventional superhero dross and half hearted execution  this is one vigilante who should really just leave all the hard work to the police hornet fans across generations will enjoy connecting this modern version to its pop cultural roots stretching back more than seven decades  a childish film written from a grade school perspective with neither quality nor excitement derivative of several molds and unable to really take command of any of them aside from a brief split screen sequence and a few deft special effects  there s almost no sizzle to this goofy take on superheroics    an uneven  disastrously overlong piece of work give me loose  idiosyncratic  comic meandering over stone faced business as usual any day  it isn t the movie you re expecting  but it s got its authors  grubby handprints all over it for what problems it does have it is a genuinely different take on this kind of material with a firm focus on action  character and humor  no one else should ever attempt to make a superhero movie quite like this  but for the green hornet it works gondry and rogen walk a fine line between fairly brainless bro medy and occasionally knowing examination of the superhero genre full review at movies for the massespart origin story  part spoof  part bromance    the movie can t decide  it winks at itself constantly  but only to hide its cluelessness gondry s biggest success is recognising that superheroes can still be funny  and embracing that in every part of this film this is not the green hornet  it s barely an action movie even if you  get  what the green hornet is trying to do  it is never terribly enjoyable really inventive a facetious industrial product  and the first out and out bore of the year one of those annoying movies that has enough good stuff in it that it can t be dismissed out of hand  but enough deficits that one is hard pressed to praise it  for a film with so many potentially hallucinatory avenues  imagination seems to be a worthless currency it almost put me to sleep  and considering just how many explosions  near escapes  fireballs  rockets and cracked heads it packs into its almost two hour running time leading this viewer to the edge of narcolepsy is a pretty nifty trick seth rogen  superhero  it s nearly impossible to wrap the mind around such an outlandish idea  almost on the same level as sarah palin as u s  president or ricky gervais as the next recipient of the golden globes lifetime achievement award perhaps we should be grateful that the green hornet is a perfectly enjoyable seth rogen movie    but it s a major missed opportunity when you consider the michel gondry spectacle that it came so close to being  despite its obvious angling to become a franchise  this green hornet offers little that s worth committing to even the  cult flick  chamber of your brain michel gondry s frivolous  exuberant film is a hard one to embrace there is no grand sense of justice or even vengeance driving the green hornet  it is just that kicking ass might be fun  and it turns out it is a bit shapeless as a story but relies on the charm of rogen and a few big set pieces to connect the dots an admirable yet underwhelming attempt at something a little different  while the green hornet is a passable time killer  cineastes might go into shock that such an unremarkable piece of hollywood mulch was helmed by french whiz kid michel gondry even the direction of michel gondry is a wipeout  the frenchman was a late recruit to the project  but precious few glimpses of his trademark surrealism are detected it has more of a sting than you might think hornet lacks sting i d hoped for better  but expected worse  which means that michel gondry s the green hornet is at best    or at worst    a mixed bag of a movie it has what is expected of this kind of movie  cool visual effects  martial arts action  car chases  explosions  shootouts and lots of james bond style gadgets it is a patchy film  haltingly paced  but the visual invention is astonishing and now here it is  and we see it really was a joke after all  thing is  it s supposed to be  despite the talent involved  this ends up an underwhelming superhero flick marred by dull action and non existent chemistry between the cast it s hard to shake the sense of well known figures cashing in on a superhero craze that doesn t quite fit them  and trying to but never fully making it their own equal parts amusing and tedious   but not in any sense the disaster some have called it the movie is extremely loud and none too funny chou steals the show  especially when he speeds into action in glorious kato vision it remains a rare franchise reboot where the sense of playfulness outweighs that of strained psychological depth or grim commercial obligation featuring an eclectic cast and unusual choice of filmmaker  the green hornet succeeds as an experiment done right there s just enough novelty  action and comedy in the tank to see this film teeter across the finish line  even if it does cough and splutter for much of the journey it s not a superhero film  it s an exuberant anti superhero film that exists with no agenda except to delight fun  full of action  and just serious enough to work without becoming ridiculous the green hornet may well be michel gondry s most elaborate meta joke on escapist infantilism    loud and violent  if not annoying can a genius and an average joe pair up and put egos aside to serve mindless adventure  gondry and rogen have  the fight scenes  filmed in what i ll call  kato vision   are top shelf and rival anything you d find in the  matrix  world a solid opening and a mayhem laden third act cannot make up for an utter mess of a middle hour or for the utter lack of charisma by jay chou as kato this boorishly irreverent superhero sendup is a fiasco  sustained only by its fx the green hornet attempts to mock its own genre  but it forgets to deliver a compelling characters along the way seth rogen  jay chou  cameron diaz and christoph waltz try to bring their characters to life in this campy action flick    but the results end up uneven at best  seth rogen s character should have evolved with humility and authenticity by relinquishing his bogus stranglehold as the green hornet and becoming the guy who smokes a fat blunt better than you but only kicks ass like your great grandma what should have been  could have been  it sure isn t this green slacker team the acting and writing of seth rogen and evan goldberg with the artsy fartsy directing of michel gondry and they d turn gone with the wind into a quirky comedy this is one occasion where too many cooks in the kitchen actually ended up making some pretty tasty junk food  i thought only flies liked piles of dung  but hornets must  too  maybe that s the reason for the evacuated pile titled the green hornet has there ever been a time when i wanted the hero to die so badly  as badly as in this film  no    rowdy  discordant  subversive and thoroughly modern  exactly what you d expect when a stoner and a visual genius team up   superhero movies often must deal with the problem of villains being more charismatic than heroes  but when your hero is so annoying that you find yourself rooting for anyone who could potentially take him out  it s a real problem for the movie an uneven  dull and painfully asinine action comedy that s neither thrilling  funny nor visually stylish enough to deliver pure entertainment  go rent kick ass instead when it works  which is more than half of the time of the time  it s a cheerful little romp that refuses to take itself seriouslygondry is an incredible visual stylist and he s showing off in a way that fits perfectly with the loose style of the movie depending on where your tolerance level is for seth rogen  you may enjoy this movie or you may hate it  still  it s a fun ride and enjoyable to watch the mvp is jay chou as kato  who is as much britt reid s superior as the valet jeeves and the dog gromit are superior to their alleged  masters  in the works of p g  wodehouse and nick park dumb  unfocused movie that is neither comedy nor action thriller  spews noxious gas and obnoxious patter there are elements of a sharp hero sidekick inversion here  kato is the handsome  brilliant inventor and karate expert  britt is  well  rich enough to pay the salary of someone like kato  but the inversion is inevitably incomplete  the film wavers uncomfortably between parody and homage  between deconstructing the excesses of the genre and simply indulging in them at least seth rogen has the good sense to wear a mask for much of the green hornet  if i d made this movie  i d want to hide my face too this is an overlong  empty bore that squanders its possibilities absurd yet entertaininga big  sloppy  loud  grating mess of a movie as a journalist  i can t come down too hard on a film s action scenes when they include a half of a car speeding through a newsroom and a shootout in an area where massive spools of newspapers are stored  a lively but sloppy update for kato and the green hornet as a crime fighting duo  britt and kato have the sophistication and finesse of a pair of middle school boys on a joy ride the green hornet is crass  unimaginative  unexciting  and not very funny  i was hoping it would at least be mindless fun but it ends up just being mindless  an action film that doesn t excite and a comedy you never laugh at the big screen green hornet  while hardly classic comic book filmmaking  ain t half bad  superhero  bromance  is funny but overly childish if you enjoy watching a lead character that s so annoying and such a jerk that you d like to punch him in the face yourself  then the green hornet is for you you ll have an absolute blast watching the green hornet  but its constantly goofy demeanor takes some of the sting out of it slick  sly and ever soslightly subversive  the green hornet is an irreverent comedy bound to annoy comic book purists   usually a good sign   and sure to delight everyone else  think this year s kick ass the green hornet smoked crack with superman and met craigslist chicks with wolverine  he s a bad influence and a good time  and he s much more entertaining on screen  too does it work  yes  if you like rogen  but if you don t you ll feel that gondry has fiddled too much with the original by giving his star full rein michel gondry directs and while there s little of his usual surreal flair there are moments when he puts his mark on the explosive mayhem  giving it the style of a live action looney toons cartoon rogen looks like he s waiting for the real leading man to turn up  and where exactly are the jokes though tonally uneven  hornet nonetheless works as breezy  irreverent entertainment that makes a virtue of its unlikely elements hornet is a hilarious and action packed film that is one of the most satisfying action buddy comedies ever made seth rogen is the green hornet  what else do you need to know once you get to the fiends and fights that make a comic book movie really work  things go stale green hornet  works both as an action movie and as a deconstruction of an action movie there might be a funny movie in a story about a crime fighter who s in it only for the publicity  but  the green hornet  isn t it rogen seems to want to convince the world that a big dumb stoner can be successful  because  hey  what the heck  it worked for him  but britt reid the green hornet doesn t have that redemption and growth  quite a bit less than the sum of its appealing parts there s simply no center here  no sense that someone is guiding the ship a better  stranger movie can be glimpsed straining to be noticed behind rogen s standard goofery witless  charmless  clumsy and appallingly unenjoyable  the green hornet is almost unrecognizable as having come from the same  endlessly inventive storehouse of creativity as eternal sunshine of the spotless mind rogen s reid doesn t become a crime fighter for an altruistic reasons  he does it as a lark because he thinks it will be fun  rogen s hornet is basically the comic relief  and that is what throws the movie a kilter dear fat seth rogen  i miss you  a long  snarky  borderline disdainful parody that s also an inferior imitation of the movies it mocks  no  thank you there s so little at stake here that nothing much matters except for a good time all buzz  no sting the picture has no reason to exist  yet exist it does  thus between movies that might be good and movies that might be exciting  it fills this unenviable slot as neither this appears to be a breakout role for the talented and charismatic chou  whose star should rise in hollywood  the movie is full of visual eye candy that includes use of a split screen and rapid editing to speed up the car chases and   there s nothing here but a concept and a marketing and merchandising strategy  at the center of which somebody   oh  no   had to come up with an actual movie while on its own lowbrow terms the movie may work well enough   kick ass  outpoints this  smart ass  cousin by a wide margin the film is a bit uneven at times  but when it s firing on all cylinders  the green hornet is far too entertaining not to enjoy  even as a mindless diversion  it s weak rogen may have lost weight for this role  but it hardly matters he s still doing a more charming version of butt head  aged twentysomething  you know by now if that works for you or not while the package as a whole never truly strikes a consistent tone  the boundless energy  surprisingly irreverent dialogue  and creative action sequences carry the day this morning  the unconscious bodies of three pickpockets were found in front of the post s offices  safety pinned to one was an envelope containing the following movie review the green hornet  has enough kicks and verve to keep the winter blues at bay  at least for a little while is gondry aware that he s making a film about both white male privilege and sexual harassment in the workplace while it may not ultimately prove memorable enough to launch a new film franchise  the green hornet is still a fun action comedy and clever superhero satire that s about as close to a cool summer movie as you re going to get in the dead of winter almost everything about the film is disappointing a joy ride of a film that evades the self consciousness that stalls so many other recent comic book adaptations  it is one of the best superhero movies ever gondry s  green hornet  does not have a serious bone in his body  its goal is to satirize superhero motifs   mainly  the idea of the ethnic sidekick there are some nifty things in between the lulls   in this hodge podge of creativity  this kinky mess  there is unbridled zest and an almost innocent sense of joythe movie these guys have come up with is fresh  funny and a bewildering surprise while it sports a few spare parts that don t quite click  this souped up superhero vehicle runs smoothly enough thanks to a savvy sense of humor and the charisma of its central crime fighting duo you d expect gondry s version of a superhero movie to be either brilliantly creative or spectacularly misguided  and it s neither  just sporadically funny but more often plodding hard to think of a more mystifying mismatch of filmmaker and material it s a strange  shapeless  rarely satisfying  but generally amiable movie in which everyone appears to be faking it as they go along  and almost    almost    getting away with it rogen isn t the obvious choice for a comic book icon but he forces his personality onto this material with an ingratiating ease brings together almost a dream team of elements which add up to only a very small fraction of the sum of their parts  the movie s just a huge mess  by the time the green hornet collapses into a mess of hackneyed car chases and flying glass and bullets  it feels less like the promised irreverent take on the superhero genre  and more like the latest iteration of the rush hour movies  the movie lopes along from one half baked scene to the next  interrupted on occasion by car porn sequences involving the hero s luminous limo the black beauty what happens when smart people set out to make a dumb movie  they made the movie they wanted to watch  rather than the one anyone else might want to pointless goof of a film  can t decide if it wants to be a superhero movie or a parody of one  a n aggressively goofy spoof of the modern dark  grim vigilante drama    with as much cartoonish  chaotic energy it can muster    and more than a little meta cunning  too the choice of seth rogen to topline this crimebusting bromedy proves an unlikely but ultimately shrewd one  plugging the void at the heart of the character with an outsize comic persona good buddy buddy chemistry between chou and rogan  along with some inspired carnage in the last half hour make the green hornet a rare treat in a traditionally slow month a too clever by half attempt to both satirize and celebrate the superhero genre the writer who first conceived of the green hornet was  in fact  paving the way for the martial arts hero  this film has done the opposite rogen tests the limits of his likeability as the spoilt brat who inherits an empire while gondry scrabbles for the right tone everything before this has been crap   says rogen during the explosive finale  many will agree gondry s film does have its goofy charms  even though it never quite decides what kind of movie it wants to be not an abject failure  but still  not a film that recognizes its own strengths  at its best  it aspires to two dimensions  three dimensions is far beyond its grasp too much  too numbing  too coy  and ultimately too violent an inventive anti hero theme sets this film apart from the usual superhero movie  but excessive violence and incoherent action leave it deeply frustrating to watch enjoyable  frequently funny and occasionally subversive comedy with a strong script  likeable performances and some impressively directed action sequences  though it does drag a bit towards the end the green hornet  is an almost unendurable demonstration of a movie with nothing to be about a very successful balance between rogen s sort of irreverent  off the cuff humor and gondry s limitless  carefully planned creativityyou know  superhero comedy is tricky  they can t all be blankman the latest hornet  perhaps the most radical makeover of all  is more slapstick than sting and less masquerading noir crime fighter than deluded cartoonish geek avenger  while seemingly referencing both tarantino s comedy of cruelty and tom and jerry  however long and honourable its pedigree  goes in one brain synapse and out the other   touted as a disaster even before its release  its off beat tale  visual styling and casting proves that the franchise has more than a little sting left in its tail i m beginning to suspect that writer producer actor seth rogen is up to foul play rogen s tongue in cheek take on a superhero is the film s best    maybe only    winning feature  but he makes this low expectations film more entertaning than you might think  as much a comedy as it is an action movie  actually it s better than that  it s one of the all too rare modern movies which manages to be both  the story falls apart  while gondry ratchets up the silly action so far over the top the structure of the film can t support it if unmodulated decibel level and childish  dorkish energy alone could lower a city s crime rate  then consider the cartoon bad guys of cartoon los angeles flattened rogen s image and his attitude as co screenwriter of the green hornet updates the bland superhero template using comic irreverence the green hornet s only victory is that it isn t flat awful the interplay between the green hornet and straight man kato delights  overshadowing cameron diaz as a mutual love interest while this latest rogen penned iteration is a game try  it feels a bit like he s trying to make a volume out of a footnote rogen is just playing a version of the good natured  wisecracking slacker he plays in everything  which never feels like a comfortable fit alongside the coolly efficient chou the green hornet is a disjointed jumble of gag laughs  goofy stunts  and bizzare casting high hopes of magic from the gondry rogen pairing are dashed  some neat touches aside  this isn t so much eternal sunshine  more superbad casting  seth  rogen as a crimefighting hero may sound dubious  until you see how the film understands and embraces the disconnect the green hornet provides a half hour s worth of mildly entertaining travesty before collapsing in a clamor of bombastic action sequences and lame wisecracks despite some entertaining moments  this long in gestation crime fighter feature never reaches top speed this hornet is a big  boisterous action comedy   a funny  exciting and intentionally goofy summer movie that just happens to arrive in the middle of january words that i never thought i d type  but must after viewing seth rogen s take on the green hornet  i miss van williams  floats like a butterfly  stings like a gnat chou  is  charismatic when his feet and fists are flying but far from nimble when he opens his mouth     which knocks the film s would be buddy comedy bromance on the head gondry s contributions to the film amount to little more than rainbow sprinkles atop a very vanilla piece of cinema  gondry  has done a stellar job of putting his wacky auteurial stamp on a comedy which is only semi coherent but still very funny and impeccably fashioned the green hornet is the usual numbing  postmodern pastiche    which is ironic  since the premise is supposed to be retro  a throwback to a simpler  less synthetic analog age done in digital style a superhero movie with the soul of a bromance  the green hornet is consistently mildly amusing but never quite as fun as it should be  injecting a devil may care attitude into a franchise focused blockbuster only gets you so far  when all is said and done  this wasp s got no sting the film is a blast a surprisingly funny and ingeniously clever take on superheroes     the green hornet certainly sets the bar high for other superhero movies coming out this year not as bad as its release date implies nor as good as its creative team suggests the story is ridiculous and not every plot point makes sense  but if you re willing to turn your brain off and abandon any second thinking  the entertainment value is high it is confident  sly  silly  thrilling  and a nice tribute to the genre and the character both a great evening s entertainment when you want to switch off and dip your head in some popcorn nan'"
